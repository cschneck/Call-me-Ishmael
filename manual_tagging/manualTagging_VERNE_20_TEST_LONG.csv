verne_20_test_long,"A noise of bolts was now heard, the door opened, and two men appeared. One was short, very muscular, broad-shouldered, with robust limbs, strong head, an abundance of black hair, thick moustache, a quick penetrating look, and the vivacity which characterises the population of [Southern France]_n0. The second stranger merits a more detailed description. [I]_p0 made out [his]_p1 prevailing qualities directly: self-confidence, because [his]_p2 head was well set on [his]_p2 shoulders, and [his]_p3 black eyes looked around with cold assurance calmness, for [his]_p3 skin, rather pale, showed [his]_p3 coolness of blood energy, evinced by the rapid contraction of [his]_p4 lofty brows and courage, because [his]_p4 deep breathing denoted great power of lungs. Whether this person was thirty-five or fifty years of age, [I]_p9 could not say. [He]_p10 was tall, had a large forehead, straight nose, a clearly cut mouth, beautiful teeth, with fine taper hands, indicative of a highly nervous temperament. This man was certainly the most admirable specimen [I]_p11 had ever met. One particular feature was [his]_p12 eyes, rather far from each other, and which could take in nearly a quarter of the horizon at once. This faculty, (I verified [it]_p13 later), gave [him]_p14 a range of vision far superior to [Ned Land]_n1 's. When this stranger fixed upon an object, [his]_p15 eyebrows met, [his]_p16 large eyelids closed around so as to contract the range of [his]_p16 vision, and [he]_p18 looked as if [he]_p19 magnified the objects lessened by distance, as if [he]_p19 pierced those sheets of water so opaque to [our]_p22 eyes, and as if [he]_p20 read the very depths of the seas.",2,,23,
verne_20_test_long," The two strangers, with caps made from the fur of the sea otter, and shod with sea boots of seal's skin, were dressed in clothes of a particular texture, which allowed free movement of the limbs. The taller of the two, evidently the chief on board, examined [us]_p23 with great attention, without saying a word then, turning to [his]_p24 companion, talked with [him]_p25 in an unknown tongue. [It]_p26 was a sonorous, harmonious, and flexible dialect, the vowels seeming to admit of very varied accentuation. The other replied by a shake of the head, and added two or three perfectly incomprehensible words. Then [he]_p27 seemed to question [me]_p28 by a look. [I]_p29 replied in good [French]_n2 that [I]_p30 did not know [his]_p31 language but [he]_p32 seemed not to understand me, and [my]_p33 situation became more embarrassing. ""If master were to tell [our]_p34 story,""said [Conseil]_n3 ,""perhaps these gentlemen may understand some words. "" [I]_p35 began to tell [our]_p36 adventures, articulating each syllable clearly, and without omitting one single detail. [I]_p37 announced [our]_p38 names and rank, introducing in person [Professor Aronnax]_n4 , [his]_p39 servant [Conseil]_n5 , and master [Ned Land]_n6 , the harpooner. The man with the soft calm eyes listened to [me]_p40 quietly, even politely, and with extreme attention but nothing in [his]_p41 countenance indicated that [he]_p42 had understood [my]_p43 story.",5,,21,
verne_20_test_long," When [I]_p44 finished, [he]_p45 said not a word. There remained one resource, to speak [English]_n7. Perhaps [they]_p46 would know this almost universal language. [I]_p47 knew it, as well as the German language, well enough to read [it]_p48 fluently, but not to speak [it]_p49 correctly. But, anyhow, [we]_p51 must make [ourselves]_p52 understood. ""Go on in [your]_p53 turn,""[I]_p55 said to the harpooner""speak [your]_p54 best [Anglo-Saxon]_n8 , and try to do better than I. ""[Ned]_n9 did not beg off, and recommenced [our]_p57 story. To [his]_p58 great disgust, the harpooner did not seem to have made [himself]_p59 more intelligible than [I]_p60 had. [Our]_p61 visitors did not stir. [They]_p62 evidently understood neither the language of [England]_n10 nor of [France]_n11.",5,,17,
verne_20_test_long," Very much embarrassed, after having vainly exhausted [our]_p63 speaking resources, [I]_p64 knew not what part to take, when [Conseil]_n12 said:""If master will permit me, [I]_p65 will relate [it]_p66 in German. "" But in spite of the elegant terms and good accent of the narrator, the German language had no success. At last, nonplussed, [I]_p67 tried to remember [my]_p68 first lessons, and to narrate [our]_p69 adventures in [Latin]_n13 , but with no better success. This last attempt being of no avail, the two strangers exchanged some words in [their]_p70 unknown language, and retired. The door shut. ""[It]_p71 is an infamous shame,""cried [Ned Land]_n14 , who broke out for the twentieth time. ""[We]_p72 speak to those rogues in [French]_n15 , [English]_n16 , German, and [Latin]_n17 , and not one of [them]_p73 has the politeness to answer!""""Calm yourself,""[I]_p74 said to the impetuous [Ned]_n18""anger will do no good. """"But do [you]_p75 see, [Professor]_n19 ,""replied [our]_p76 irascible companion,""that [we]_p77 shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage?""""[Bah]_n20 !""said [Conseil]_n21 , philosophically""[we]_p78 can hold out some time yet. "" ""[My]_p79 friends,"" [I]_p80 said, ""[we]_p81 must not despair. [We]_p82 have been worse off than this.",10,,20,
verne_20_test_long," Do [me]_p83 the favour to wait a little before forming an opinion upon the commander and crew of this boat. """"[My]_p84 opinion is formed,""replied [Ned Land]_n22 , sharply. ""[They]_p85 are rascals. """"Good! and from what country?""""From the land of rogues!""""[My]_p86 brave [Ned]_n23 , that country is not clearly indicated on the map of the world but [I]_p87 admit that the nationality of the two strangers is hard to determine. Neither [English]_n24 , [French]_n25 , nor German, that is quite certain. However, [I]_p88 am inclined to think that the commander and [his]_p89 companion were born in low latitudes. There is southern blood in them. But [I]_p90 cannot decide by [their]_p91 appearance whether [they]_p92 are Spaniards, Turks, Arabians, or Indians. As to [their]_p93 language, [it]_p94 is quite incomprehensible. """"There is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages,""said [Conseil]_n26 ,""or the disadvantage of not having one universal language.",5,,12,
verne_20_test_long," "" As [he]_p95 said these words, the door opened. A steward entered. [He]_p96 brought [us]_p97 clothes, coats and trousers, made of a stuff [I]_p98 did not know. [I]_p99 hastened to dress myself, and [my]_p100 companions followed [my]_p101 example. During that time, the steward, dumb, perhaps deaf, had arranged the table, and laid three plates. ""This is something like!""said [Conseil]_n27. ""[Bah]_n28 !""said the angry harpooner,""what do [you]_p102 suppose [they]_p103 eat here? [Tortoise]_n29 liver, filleted shark, and beef steaks from seadogs. """"[We]_p104 shall see,""said [Conseil]_n30. The dishes, of bell metal, were placed on the table, and [we]_p105 took [our]_p106 places. Undoubtedly [we]_p107 had to do with civilised people, and, had [it]_p108 not been for the electric light which flooded us, [I]_p109 could have fancied [I]_p110 was in the dining-room of the [Adelphi Hotel]_n31 at [Liverpool]_n32 , or at the [Grand Hotel]_n33 in [Paris]_n34.",8,,16,
verne_20_test_long," [I]_p111 must say, however, that there was neither bread nor wine. The water was fresh and clear, but [it]_p112 was water and did not suit [Ned Land]_n35 's taste. Amongst the dishes which were brought to us, [I]_p113 recognised several fish delicately dressed but of some, although excellent, [I]_p114 could give no opinion, neither could [I]_p114 tell to what kingdom [they]_p116 belonged, whether animal or vegetable. As to the dinner-service, [it]_p117 was elegant, and in perfect taste. Each utensil, spoon, fork, knife, plate, had a letter engraved on it, with a motto above it, of which this is an exact facsimile: MOBILIS IN MOBILI N The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical person who commanded at the bottom of the seas. [Ned]_n36 and [Conseil]_n37 did not reflect much. [They]_p118 devoured the food, and [I]_p119 did likewise. [I]_p120 was, besides, reassured as to [our]_p121 fate and [it]_p123 seemed evident that [our]_p122 hosts would not let [us]_p124 die of want. However, everything has an end, everything passes away, even the hunger of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours. [Our]_p125 appetites satisfied, [we]_p126 felt overcome with sleep.",3,,16,
verne_20_test_long," ""Faith! [I]_p127 shall sleep well,""said [Conseil]_n38. ""So shall I,""replied [Ned Land]_n39. [My]_p128 two companions stretched [themselves]_p129 on the cabin carpet, and were soon sound asleep. For [my]_p130 own part, too many thoughts crowded [my]_p131 brain, too many insoluble questions pressed upon me, too many fancies kept [my]_p131 eyes half open. Where were we? What strange power carried [us]_p133 on? [I]_p134 felt, or rather fancied [I]_p135 felt, the machine sinking down to the lowest beds of the sea. Dreadful nightmares beset [me]_p136 [I]_p137 saw in these mysterious asylums a world of unknown animals, amongst which this submarine boat seemed to be of the same kind, living, moving, and formidable as they. Then [my]_p138 brain grew calmer, [my]_p139 imagination wandered into vague unconsciousness, and [I]_p140 soon fell into a deep sleep. CHAPTER IX [NED LAND]_n40 'S TEMPERS How long [we]_p141 slept [I]_p142 do not know but [our]_p143 sleep must have lasted long, for [it]_p145 rested [us]_p146 completely from [our]_p144 fatigues. [I]_p147 woke first. [My]_p148 companions had not moved, and were still stretched in [their]_p149 corner.",3,,23,
verne_20_test_long," Hardly roused from [my]_p150 somewhat hard couch, [I]_p153 felt [my]_p151 brain freed, [my]_p151 mind clear. [I]_p154 then began an attentive examination of [our]_p155 cell. Nothing was changed inside. The prison was still a prison, the prisoners, prisoners. However, the steward, during [our]_p156 sleep, had cleared the table. [I]_p157 breathed with difficulty. The heavy air seemed to oppress [my]_p158 lungs. Although the cell was large, [we]_p159 had evidently consumed a great part of the oxygen that [it]_p160 contained. Indeed, each man consumes, in one hour, the oxygen contained in more than 176 pints of air, and this air, charged (as then) with a nearly equal quantity of carbonic acid, becomes unbreathable. [It]_p161 became necessary to renew the atmosphere of [our]_p162 prison, and no doubt the whole in the submarine boat.",0,,13,
verne_20_test_long," That gave rise to a question in [my]_p163 mind. How would the commander of this floating dwelling-place proceed? Would [he]_p164 obtain air by chemical means, in getting by heat the oxygen contained in chlorate of potash, and in absorbing carbonic acid by caustic potash? [Or]_n41 , a more convenient, economical, and consequently more probable alternative, would [he]_p165 be satisfied to rise and take breath at the surface of the water, like a whale, and so renew for twenty-four hours the atmospheric provision? In fact, [I]_p166 was already obliged to increase [my]_p168 respirations to eke out of this cell the little oxygen [it]_p169 contained, when suddenly [I]_p167 was refreshed by a current of pure air, and perfumed with saline emanations. [It]_p170 was an invigorating sea breeze, charged with iodine. [I]_p171 opened [my]_p172 mouth wide, and [my]_p173 lungs saturated [themselves]_p174 with fresh particles. At the same time [I]_p175 felt the boat rolling. The iron-plated monster had evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe, after the fashion of whales. [I]_p176 found out from that the mode of ventilating the boat. When [I]_p177 had inhaled this air freely, [I]_p178 sought the conduit pipe, which conveyed to [us]_p180 the beneficial whiff, and [I]_p178 was not long in finding it. Above the door was a ventilator, through which volumes of fresh air renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell. [I]_p181 was making [my]_p182 observations, when [Ned]_n42 and [Conseil]_n43 awoke almost at the same time, under the influence of this reviving air.",3,,20,
verne_20_test_long," [They]_p183 rubbed [their]_p184 eyes, stretched themselves, and were on [their]_p185 feet in an instant. ""Did master sleep well?""asked [Conseil]_n44 , with [his]_p186 usual politeness. ""Very well, [my]_p187 brave boy. And you, [Mr Land]_n45 ?""""Soundly, [Professor]_n46. But, [I]_p188 don't know if [I]_p189 am right or not, there seems to be a sea breeze!""A seaman could not be mistaken, and [I]_p189 told the [Canadian]_n47 all that had passed during [his]_p191 sleep. ""Good!"" said he. ""That accounts for those roarings [we]_p192 heard, when the supposed narwhal sighted the [Abraham Lincoln]_n48. """"Quite so, [Master Land]_n49 [it]_p193 was taking breath. """"Only, [Mr Aronnax]_n50 , [I]_p194 have no idea what o'clock [it]_p195 is, unless [it]_p196 is dinner-time. "" ""Dinner-time! [my]_p197 good fellow? Say rather breakfast-time, for [we]_p198 certainly have begun another day.",7,,16,
verne_20_test_long," """"So,""said [Conseil]_n51 ,""[we]_p199 have slept twenty-four hours?""""That is [my]_p200 opinion. """"[I]_p201 will not contradict you,""replied [Ned Land]_n52. ""But, dinner or breakfast, the steward will be welcome, whichever [he]_p202 brings. """"[Master Land]_n53 , [we]_p203 must conform to the rules on board, and [I]_p204 suppose [our]_p205 appetites are in advance of the dinner hour. """"That is just like you, friend [Conseil]_n54 ,""said [Ned]_n55 , impatiently. ""[You]_p206 are never out of temper, always calm [you]_p207 would return thanks before grace, and die of hunger rather than complain!"" Time was getting on, and [we]_p208 were fearfully hungry and this time the steward did not appear. [It]_p209 was rather too long to leave us, if [they]_p210 really had good intentions towards us. [Ned Land]_n56 , tormented by the cravings of hunger, got still more angry and, notwithstanding [his]_p211 promise, [I]_p212 dreaded an explosion when [he]_p213 found [himself]_p214 with one of the crew. For two hours more [Ned Land]_n57 's temper increased [he]_p215 cried, [he]_p216 shouted, but in vain. The walls were deaf.",7,,18,
verne_20_test_long," There was no sound to be heard in the boat all was still as death. [It]_p217 did not move, for [I]_p218 should have felt the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw. Plunged in the depths of the waters, [it]_p219 belonged no longer to earth: this silence was dreadful. [I]_p220 felt terrified, [Conseil]_n58 was calm, [Ned Land]_n59 roared. Just then a noise was heard outside. Steps sounded on the metal flags. The locks were turned, the door opened, and the steward appeared. Before [I]_p221 could rush forward to stop him, the [Canadian]_n60 had thrown [him]_p222 down, and held [him]_p223 by the throat. The steward was choking under the grip of [his]_p225 powerful hand. [Conseil]_n61 was already trying to unclasp the harpooner's hand from [his]_p226 half-suffocated victim, and [I]_p227 was going to fly to the rescue, when suddenly [I]_p228 was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in [French]_n62 :""Be quiet, [Master Land]_n63 and you, [Professor]_n64 , will [you]_p229 be so good as to listen to me?""CHAPTER X THE MAN OF THE [SEAS]_n65 [It]_p231 was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke.",8,,13,
verne_20_test_long," At these words, [Ned Land]_n66 rose suddenly. The steward, nearly strangled, tottered out on a sign from [his]_p232 master. But such was the power of the commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which this man must have felt towards the [Canadian]_n67. [Conseil]_n68 interested in spite of himself, [I]_p233 stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this scene. The commander, leaning against the corner of a table with [his]_p234 arms folded, scanned [us]_p235 with profound attention. Did [he]_p236 hesitate to speak? Did [he]_p237 regret the words which [he]_p237 had just spoken in [French]_n69 ? [One]_p239 might almost think so. After some moments of silence, which not one of [us]_p240 dreamed of breaking,""[Gentlemen]_n70 ,""said he, in a calm and penetrating voice,""[I]_p241 speak [French]_n71 , [English]_n72 , German, and [Latin]_n73 equally well. [I]_p242 could, therefore, have answered [you]_p244 at [our]_p246 first interview, but [I]_p243 wished to know [you]_p245 first, then to reflect. The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the main points, convinced [me]_p247 of [your]_p248 identity. [I]_p249 know now that chance has brought before [me]_p250 M.",8,,19,
verne_20_test_long," [Pierre Aronnax]_n74 , [Professor]_n75 of [Natural]_n76 History at the [Museum]_n77 of [Paris]_n78 , entrusted with a scientific mission abroad, [Conseil]_n79 , [his]_p251 servant, and [Ned Land]_n80 , of [Canadian]_n81 origin, harpooner on board the frigate [Abraham Lincoln]_n82 of the navy of the [United States]_n83 of [America]_n84. "" [I]_p252 bowed assent. [It]_p253 was not a question that the commander put to me. Therefore there was no answer to be made. This man expressed [himself]_p254 with perfect ease, without any accent. [His]_p255 sentences were well turned, [his]_p256 words clear, and [his]_p257 fluency of speech remarkable. Yet, [I]_p258 did not recognise in [him]_p259 a fellow-countryman. [He]_p260 continued the conversation in these terms: ""[You]_p261 have doubtless thought, sir, that [I]_p262 have delayed long in paying [you]_p263 this second visit. The reason is that, [your]_p264 identity recognised, [I]_p265 wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you. [I]_p266 have hesitated much.",11,,16,
verne_20_test_long," Most annoying circumstances have brought [you]_p267 into the presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity. [You]_p268 have come to trouble [my]_p269 existence. "" ""Unintentionally!"" said I. ""Unintentionally?"" replied the stranger, raising [his]_p270 voice a little. ""Was [it]_p271 unintentionally that the [Abraham Lincoln]_n85 pursued [me]_p275 all over the seas? Was [it]_p272 unintentionally that [you]_p277 took passage in this frigate? Was [it]_p272 unintentionally that [your]_p278 cannon-balls rebounded off the plating of [my]_p279 vessel? Was [it]_p273 unintentionally that [Mr Ned Land]_n86 struck [me]_p276 with [his]_p280 harpoon?""[I]_p281 detected a restrained irritation in these words. But to these recriminations [I]_p282 had a very natural answer to make, and [I]_p283 made it. ""Sir,""said I,""no doubt [you]_p284 are ignorant of the discussions which have taken place concerning [you]_p285 in [America]_n87 and [Europe]_n88. [You]_p286 do not know that divers accidents, caused by collisions with [your]_p287 submarine machine, have excited public feeling in the two continents. [I]_p288 omit the theories without number by which [it]_p289 was sought to explain that of which [you]_p290 alone possess the secret. But [you]_p291 must understand that, in pursuing [you]_p292 over the high seas of the [Pacific]_n89 , the [Abraham Lincoln]_n90 believed [itself]_p293 to be chasing some powerful sea-monster, of which [it]_p294 was necessary to rid the ocean at any price.",6,,28,
verne_20_test_long," "" A half-smile curled the lips of the commander: then, in a calmer tone: ""M. [Aronnax]_n91 ,""[he]_p295 replied,""dare [you]_p296 affirm that [your]_p297 frigate would not as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?""This question embarrassed me, for certainly [Captain Farragut]_n92 might not have hesitated. [He]_p298 might have thought [it]_p299 [his]_p300 duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind, as [he]_p301 would a gigantic narwhal. ""[You]_p302 understand then, sir,"" continued the stranger, ""that [I]_p303 have the right to treat [you]_p305 as enemies?"" [I]_p304 answered nothing, purposely. For what good would [it]_p306 be to discuss such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments? ""[I]_p307 have hesitated some time,"" continued the commander ""nothing obliged [me]_p308 to show [you]_p309 hospitality. If [I]_p310 chose to separate [myself]_p314 from you, [I]_p311 should have no interest in seeing [you]_p315 again [I]_p311 could place [you]_p316 upon the deck of this vessel which has served [you]_p316 as a refuge, [I]_p312 could sink beneath the waters, and forget that [you]_p317 had ever existed. Would not that be [my]_p320 right?"" ""[It]_p321 might be the right of a savage,"" [I]_p322 answered, ""but not that of a civilised man. """"[Professor]_n93 ,""replied the commander, quickly,""[I]_p323 am not what [you]_p326 call a civilised man! [I]_p324 have done with society entirely, for reasons which [I]_p324 alone have the right of appreciating. [I]_p327 do not, therefore, obey [its]_p329 laws, and [I]_p328 desire [you]_p330 never to allude to [them]_p331 before [me]_p332 again!"" This was said plainly. A flash of anger and disdain kindled in the eyes of the Unknown, and [I]_p333 had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life of this man.",3,,38,
verne_20_test_long," Not only had [he]_p334 put [himself]_p340 beyond the pale of human laws, but [he]_p335 had made [himself]_p341 independent of them, free in the strictest acceptation of the word, quite beyond [their]_p342 reach! Who then would dare to pursue [him]_p343 at the bottom of the sea, when, on [its]_p346 surface, [he]_p335 defied all attempts made against him? What vessel could resist the shock of [his]_p347 submarine monitor? What cuirass, however thick, could withstand the blows of [his]_p348 spur? No man could demand from [him]_p344 an account of [his]_p348 actions God, if [he]_p336 believed in one, [his]_p349 conscience, if [he]_p336 had one, were the sole judges to whom [he]_p336 was answerable. These reflections crossed [my]_p351 mind rapidly, whilst the stranger personage was silent, absorbed, and as if wrapped up in himself. [I]_p352 regarded [him]_p353 with fear mingled with interest, as, doubtless, [OEdiphus]_n94 regarded the [Sphinx]_n95. After rather a long silence, the commander resumed the conversation.",2,,19,
