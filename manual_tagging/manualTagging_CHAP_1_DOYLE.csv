chap_1_doyle,"Chapter 1. Mr [Sherlock]_n0 [Holmes]_n1 Mr [Sherlock]_n2 [Holmes]_n3 , who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when [he]_p0 was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. [I]_p1 stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which [our]_p2 visitor had left behind [him]_p3 the night before. [It]_p4 was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a. ""[Penang]_n4 lawyer. "". Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across. ""To [James]_n5 [Mortimer]_n6 , M. R. C.",7,,5,
chap_1_doyle," S. , from [his]_p5 friends of the C. C. H. ,"". was engraved upon it, with the date. ""1884. "". [It]_p6 was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry, dignified, solid, and reassuring. ""Well, [Watson]_n7 , what do [you]_p7 make of it? [Holmes]_n8 was sitting with [his]_p8 back to me, and [I]_p9 had given [him]_p10 no sign of [my]_p11 occupation.",2,,7,
chap_1_doyle," ""How did [you]_p12 know what [I]_p14 was doing? [I]_p15 believe [you]_p13 have eyes in the back of [your]_p16 head. ""I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,"". said he. ""But, tell me, [Watson]_n9 , what do [you]_p17 make of [our]_p18 visitor's stick? Since [we]_p19 have been so unfortunate as to miss [him]_p20 and have no notion of [his]_p21 errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let [me]_p22 hear [you]_p23 reconstruct the man by an examination of it. ""I think,"". said I, following as far as [I]_p24 could the methods of [my]_p26 companion,. ""that Dr [Mortimer]_n10 is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since those who know [him]_p27 give [him]_p28 this mark of [their]_p29 appreciation. ""Good!"". said [Holmes]_n11.",3,,17,
chap_1_doyle," ""Excellent!. ""I think also that the probability is in favour of [his]_p30 being a country practitioner who does a great deal of [his]_p31 visiting on foot. ""Why so?. ""Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that [I]_p32 can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. The [thick-iron]_n12 ferrule is worn down, so [it]_p33 is evident that [he]_p35 has done a great amount of walking with it. ""Perfectly sound!"". said [Holmes]_n13. ""And then again, there is the friends of the C. C. H.",2,,5,
chap_1_doyle," ' [I]_p36 should guess that to be the [Something]_n14 [Hunt]_n15 , the local hunt to whose members [he]_p37 has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made [him]_p38 a small presentation in return. ""Really, [Watson]_n16 , [you]_p39 excel yourself,"". said [Holmes]_n17 , pushing back [his]_p40 chair and lighting a cigarette. ""I am bound to say that in all the accounts which [you]_p41 have been so good as to give of [my]_p43 own small achievements [you]_p42 have habitually underrated [your]_p44 own abilities. [It]_p45 may be that [you]_p46 are not [yourself]_p48 luminous, but [you]_p47 are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. [I]_p49 confess, [my]_p51 dear fellow, that [I]_p50 am very much in [your]_p52 debt. [He]_p53 had never said as much before, and [I]_p54 must admit that [his]_p57 words gave [me]_p60 keen pleasure, for [I]_p55 had often been piqued by [his]_p58 indifference to [my]_p61 admiration and to the attempts which [I]_p55 had made to give publicity to [his]_p58 methods. [I]_p62 was proud, too, to think that [I]_p63 had so far mastered [his]_p64 system as to apply [it]_p66 in a way which earned [his]_p65 approval. [He]_p67 now took the stick from [my]_p68 hands and examined [it]_p69 for a few minutes with [his]_p70 naked eyes.",4,,35,
chap_1_doyle," Then with an expression of interest [he]_p71 laid down [his]_p73 cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, [he]_p72 looked over [it]_p74 again with a convex lens. ""Interesting, though elementary,"". said [he]_p75 as [he]_p76 returned to [his]_p77 favourite corner of the settee. ""There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. [It]_p78 gives [us]_p79 the basis for several deductions. ""Has anything escaped me?"". [I]_p80 asked with some self-importance. ""I trust that there is nothing of consequence which [I]_p81 have overlooked?. ""I am afraid, [my]_p83 dear [Watson]_n18 , that most of [your]_p84 conclusions were erroneous. When [I]_p85 said that [you]_p88 stimulated [me]_p89 [I]_p86 meant, to be frank, that in noting [your]_p90 fallacies [I]_p86 was occasionally guided towards the truth.",1,,19,
chap_1_doyle," Not that [you]_p91 are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And [he]_p92 walks a good deal. ""Then [I]_p93 was right. ""To that extent. ""But that was all. ""No, no, [my]_p94 dear [Watson]_n19 , not all, by no means all. [I]_p95 would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials C. C. ' are placed before that hospital the words [Charing]_n20 [Cross]_n21 ' very naturally suggest themselves.",3,,5,
