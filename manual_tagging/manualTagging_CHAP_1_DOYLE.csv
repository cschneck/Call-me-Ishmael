chap_1_doyle,"Chapter [Mr Sherlock Holmes]_n0 , who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when [he]_p0 was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. [I]_p1 stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which [our]_p2 visitor had left behind [him]_p3 the night before. [It]_p4 was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a. ""[Penang]_n1 lawyer. "". Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across. ""To [James Mortimer]_n2 , M. R. C. S.",3,,5,
chap_1_doyle," , from [his]_p5 friends of the C. C. H. ,"". was engraved upon it, with the date. ""1884. "". [It]_p6 was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry, dignified, solid, and reassuring. ""Well, [Watson]_n3 , what do [you]_p7 make of it? [Holmes]_n4 was sitting with [his]_p8 back to me, and [I]_p9 had given [him]_p10 no sign of [my]_p11 occupation. ""How did [you]_p12 know what [I]_p14 was doing? [I]_p15 believe [you]_p13 have eyes in the back of [your]_p16 head.",2,,12,
chap_1_doyle," ""[I]_p17 have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,"". said he. ""But, tell me, [Watson]_n5 , what do [you]_p18 make of [our]_p19 visitor's stick? Since [we]_p20 have been so unfortunate as to miss [him]_p21 and have no notion of [his]_p22 errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let [me]_p23 hear [you]_p24 reconstruct the man by an examination of it. ""[I]_p25 think,"". said I, following as far as [I]_p26 could the methods of [my]_p28 companion,. ""that [Dr Mortimer]_n6 is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since those who know [him]_p29 give [him]_p30 this mark of [their]_p31 appreciation. ""Good!"". said [Holmes]_n7. ""Excellent!.",3,,14,
chap_1_doyle," ""[I]_p32 think also that the probability is in favour of [his]_p33 being a country practitioner who does a great deal of [his]_p34 visiting on foot. ""Why so?. ""Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that [I]_p35 can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. The [thick-iron]_n8 ferrule is worn down, so [it]_p36 is evident that [he]_p38 has done a great amount of walking with it. ""Perfectly sound!"". said [Holmes]_n9. ""And then again, there is the friends of the C. C. H. ' [I]_p39 should guess that to be the [Something Hunt]_n10 , the local hunt to whose members [he]_p40 has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made [him]_p41 a small presentation in return.",3,,9,
chap_1_doyle," ""Really, [Watson]_n11 , [you]_p42 excel yourself,"". said [Holmes]_n12 , pushing back [his]_p43 chair and lighting a cigarette. ""[I]_p44 am bound to say that in all the accounts which [you]_p45 have been so good as to give of [my]_p47 own small achievements [you]_p46 have habitually underrated [your]_p48 own abilities. [It]_p49 may be that [you]_p50 are not [yourself]_p52 luminous, but [you]_p51 are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. [I]_p53 confess, [my]_p55 dear fellow, that [I]_p54 am very much in [your]_p56 debt. [He]_p57 had never said as much before, and [I]_p58 must admit that [his]_p61 words gave [me]_p64 keen pleasure, for [I]_p59 had often been piqued by [his]_p62 indifference to [my]_p65 admiration and to the attempts which [I]_p59 had made to give publicity to [his]_p62 methods. [I]_p66 was proud, too, to think that [I]_p67 had so far mastered [his]_p68 system as to apply [it]_p70 in a way which earned [his]_p69 approval. [He]_p71 now took the stick from [my]_p72 hands and examined [it]_p73 for a few minutes with [his]_p74 naked eyes. Then with an expression of interest [he]_p75 laid down [his]_p77 cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, [he]_p76 looked over [it]_p78 again with a convex lens.",2,,37,
chap_1_doyle," ""Interesting, though elementary,"". said [he]_p79 as [he]_p80 returned to [his]_p81 favourite corner of the settee. ""There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. [It]_p82 gives [us]_p83 the basis for several deductions. ""Has anything escaped me?"". [I]_p84 asked with some self-importance. ""[I]_p85 trust that there is nothing of consequence which [I]_p86 have overlooked?. ""[I]_p87 am afraid, [my]_p88 dear [Watson]_n13 , that most of [your]_p89 conclusions were erroneous. When [I]_p90 said that [you]_p93 stimulated [me]_p94 [I]_p91 meant, to be frank, that in noting [your]_p95 fallacies [I]_p91 was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not that [you]_p96 are entirely wrong in this instance.",1,,18,
chap_1_doyle," The man is certainly a country practitioner. And [he]_p97 walks a good deal. ""Then [I]_p98 was right. ""To that extent. ""But that was all. ""No, no, [my]_p99 dear [Watson]_n14 , not all, by no means all. [I]_p100 would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials C. C. ' are placed before that hospital the words [Charing Cross]_n15 ' very naturally suggest themselves. ""[You]_p101 may be right.",2,,5,
