kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p4 lay on [his]_p5 armour-like back, and if [he]_p8 lifted [his]_p6 head a little [he]_p9 could see [his]_p6 brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.",0,,6,

kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p17 room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between [its]_p18 four familiar walls.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - [Samsa]_n1 was a travelling salesman - and above [it]_p19 there hung a picture that [he]_p20 had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice,gilded frame.",1,,2,

kafka_metamorphosis," ""How about if [I]_p24 sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense"", [he]_p25 thought, but that was something [he]_p26 was unable to do because [he]_p26 was used to sleeping on [his]_p28 right, and in [his]_p29 present state couldn't get into that position.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," However hard [he]_p30 threw [himself]_p33 onto [his]_p34 right, [he]_p31 always rolled back to where [he]_p31 was.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p35 must have tried [it]_p36 a hundred times, shut [his]_p37 eyes so that [he]_p38 wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when [he]_p39 began to feel a mild, dull pain there that [he]_p39 had never felt before.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Oh, God"", [he]_p41 thought, ""what a strenuous career [it]_p42 is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing [your]_p43 own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that [you]_p44 can never get to know anyone or become friendly with [them]_p45.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p46 can all go to [Hell]_n3 !""[He]_p47 felt a slight itch up on [his]_p48 belly pushed [himself]_p52 slowly up on [his]_p49 back towards the headboard so that [he]_p53 could lift [his]_p49 head better found where the itch was,and saw that [it]_p59 was covered with lots of little white spots which [he]_p54 didn't know what to make of and when [he]_p54 tried to feel the place with one of [his]_p50 legs [he]_p55 drew [it]_p60 quickly back because as soon as [he]_p55 touched [it]_p60 [he]_p55 was overcome by a cold shudder.",1,,16,

kafka_metamorphosis," If [I]_p73 didn't have [my]_p79 parents to think about I'd have given in [my]_p80 notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told [him]_p81 just what [I]_p74 think, tell [him]_p82 everything [I]_p74 would, let [him]_p82 know just what [I]_p75 feel.",0,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis," He'd fall right off [his]_p84 desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at [your]_p85 desk, talking down at [your]_p86 subordinates from up there, especially when [you]_p87 have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," Well, there's still some hope once I've got the money together to pay off [my]_p91 parents'debt to [him]_p92 - another five or six years [I]_p88 suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.",0,,3,

kafka_metamorphosis," ""God in [Heaven]_n4 !""[he]_p95 thought.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p96 was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, [it]_p97 was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, Had the alarm clock not rung? [He]_p98 could see from the bed that [it]_p99 had been set for four o'clock as [it]_p100 should have been [it]_p100 certainly must have rung.,0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," Yes, but was [it]_p102 possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, [he]_p103 had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," What should [he]_p104 do now? The next train went at seven if [he]_p105 were to catch that [he]_p105 would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and [he]_p106 did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," And even if [he]_p108 did catch the train [he]_p109 would not avoid [his]_p111 boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go,[he]_p109 would have put in [his]_p112 report about [Gregor]_n5 's not being there a long time ago.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding.",0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis, What about if [he]_p113 reported sick?But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service [Gregor]_n6 had never once yet been ill.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p114 boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse [his]_p115 parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," And what's more,would [he]_p116 have been entirely wrong in this case?[Gregor]_n7 did in fact,apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long,feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p117 was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, There was a cautious knock at the door near [his]_p118 head.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Gregor]_n8"", somebody called - [it]_p119 was [his]_p121 mother -""it's quarter to seven.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Didn't [you]_p122 want to go somewhere ?""That gentle voice![Gregor]_n9 was shocked when [he]_p123 heard [his]_p125 own voice answering,[it]_p126 could hardly be recognised as the voice [he]_p124 had had before.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," As if from deep inside [him]_p127, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with [it]_p128, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made [them]_p129 unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether [he]_p130 had heard properly or not.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n10 had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything,but in the circumstances contented [himself]_p131 with saying:""Yes,mother,yes,thank-you,I'm getting up now.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""The change in [Gregor]_n11 's voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door,as [his]_p132 mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that [Gregor]_n12,against [their]_p133 expectations was still at home,and soon [his]_p134 father came knocking at one of the side doors,gently,but with [his]_p135 fist.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Gregor]_n13,[Gregor]_n14"", [he]_p136 called ,""what's wrong ?""And after a short while [he]_p137 called again with a warning deepness in [his]_p138 voice[:""G]_n[15 regor]_n16!Gregor !""At the other side door [his]_p139 sister came p[lainti]_n17 vely:""Gregor?Aren't [you]_p141 well?Do [you]_p142 [need a]_n18 nything ?""Gregor answered to both sides:""I'm ready,now"", making an effort to remove all the strangeness from [his]_p139 voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,individual word.",6,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p143 father went back to [his]_p144 breakfast,but [his]_p145 sister whispered:""[Gregor]_n19,open the door,[I]_p146 beg of [you]_p147.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Gregor]_n20,however,had no thought of opening the door,and instead congratulated [himself]_p148 for [his]_p149 cautious habit,acquired from [his]_p150 travelling,of locking all doors at night even when [he]_p151 was at home.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," The first thing [he]_p152 wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have [his]_p153 breakfast.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Only then would [he]_p154 consider what to do next, as [he]_p155 was well aware that [he]_p155 would not bring [his]_p157 thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p158 remembered that [he]_p159 had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and [he]_p160 wondered how [his]_p161 imaginings would slowly resolve [themselves]_p162 today.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p163 did not have the slightest doubt that the change in [his]_p164 voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [It]_p165 was a simple matter to throw off the covers [he]_p166 only had to blow [himself]_p167 up a little and [they]_p168 fell off by [themselves]_p169.,0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," But [it]_p170 became difficult after that, especially as [he]_p171 was so exceptionally broad.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p172 would have used [his]_p173 arms and [his]_p174 hands to push [himself]_p175 up but instead of [them]_p176 [he]_p177 only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which [he]_p178 was moreover unable to control.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," If [he]_p179 wanted to bend one of [them]_p182, then that was the first one that would stretch [itself]_p183 out and if [he]_p180 finally managed to do what [he]_p180 wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""This is something that can't be done in bed"", [Gregor]_n21 said to [himself]_p184 ,""so don't keep trying to do [it]_p185"".",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," The first thing [he]_p186 wanted to do was get the lower part of [his]_p192 body out of the bed, but [he]_p187 had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what [it]_p194 looked like [it]_p195 turned out to be too hard to move  [it]_p195 went so slowly and finally, almost in a frenzy, when [he]_p187 carelessly shoved [himself]_p197 forwards with all the force [he]_p188 could gather, [he]_p188 chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain [he]_p188 felt that the lower part of [his]_p193 body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.",0,,12,
kafka_metamorphosis," So then [he]_p198 tried to get the top part of [his]_p199 body out of the bed first, carefully turning [his]_p200 head to the side.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," This [he]_p201 managed quite easily, and despite [its]_p202 breadth and [its]_p203 weight, the bulk of [his]_p204 body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," But when [he]_p205 had at last got [his]_p208 head out of the bed and into the fresh air [it]_p210 occurred to [him]_p212 that if [he]_p206 let [himself]_p213 fall [it]_p211 would be a miracle if [his]_p209 head were not injured, so [he]_p206 became afraid to carry on pushing [himself]_p214 forward the same way.",0,,10,
kafka_metamorphosis, And [he]_p215 could not knock [himself]_p216 out now at any price better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p217 took just as much effort to get back to where [he]_p218 had been earlier, but when [he]_p219 lay there sighing, and was once more watching [his]_p221 legs as [they]_p222 struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, [he]_p219 could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p223 told [himself]_p224 once more that [it]_p225 was not possible for [him]_p227 to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of [it]_p226 in whatever way [he]_p228 could at whatever sacrifice.,0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," At the same time, though, [he]_p229 did not forget to remind [himself]_p230 that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," At times like this [he]_p231 would direct [his]_p233 eyes to the window and look out as clearly as [he]_p232 could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer [him]_p234.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Seven o'clock, already"", [he]_p235 said to [himself]_p236 when the clock struck again, ""seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like this.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" And [he]_p237 lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if [he]_p238 perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to [their]_p239 real and natural state.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," But then [he]_p240 said to himself: ""Before [it]_p241 strikes quarter past seven I'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to [me]_p242 as well, as [they]_p243 open up at work before seven o'clock.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" And so [he]_p244 set [himself]_p245 to the task of swinging the entire length of [his]_p246 body out of the bed all at the same time.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, If [he]_p247 succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept [his]_p250 head raised as [he]_p248 did so [he]_p248 could probably avoid injuring [it]_p251.,0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p252 back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to [it]_p253 falling onto the carpet.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p254 main concern was for the loud noise [he]_p255 was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, But [it]_p256 was something that had to be risked.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," When [Gregor]_n22 was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort,all [he]_p257 had to do was rock back and forth - [it]_p258 occurred to [him]_p259 how simple everything would be if somebody came to help [him]_p260.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," Two strong people - [he]_p261 had [his]_p263 father and the maid in mind - would have been more than enough [they]_p265 would only have to push [their]_p266 arms under the dome of [his]_p264 back, peel [him]_p267 away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as [he]_p262 swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," Should [he]_p268 really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty [he]_p269 was in, [he]_p269 could not suppress a smile at this thought.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, After a while [he]_p271 had already moved so far across that [it]_p273 would have been hard for [him]_p274 to keep [his]_p275 balance if [he]_p272 rocked too hard.,0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, The time was now ten past seven and [he]_p276 would have to make a final decision very soon.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, Then there was a ring at the door of the flat.,0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""That'll be someone from work"", [he]_p277 said to [himself]_p278, and froze very still, although [his]_p279 little legs only became all the more lively as [they]_p280 danced around.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, For a moment everything remained quiet.,0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""They're not opening the door"", [Gregor]_n23 said to [himself]_p281,caught in some nonsensical hope.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," But then of course, the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened [it]_p282.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n24 only needed to hear the visitor's first words of greeting and [he]_p283 knew who [it]_p284 was - the chief clerk [himself]_p285.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," Why did [Gregor]_n25 have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where [they]_p286 immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming?Were all employees,every one of [them]_p288,louts,was there not one of [them]_p289 who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that [he]_p290 couldn't get out of bed if [he]_p291 didn't spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business?Was [it]_p293 really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were even necessary - did the chief clerk have to come [himself]_p295,and did [they]_p287 have to show the whole,innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate [it]_p294?And more because these thoughts had made [him]_p297 upset than through any proper decision,[he]_p291 swang [himself]_p296 with all [his]_p298 force out of the bed.",1,,13,
kafka_metamorphosis," There was a loud thump, but [it]_p299 wasn't really a loud noise.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p300 fall was softened a little by the carpet,and [Gregor]_n26 's back was also more elastic than [he]_p301 had thought,which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p302 had not held [his]_p303 head carefully enough, though, and hit [it]_p304 as [he]_p307 fell annoyed and in pain, [he]_p308 turned [it]_p305 and rubbed [it]_p305 against the carpet.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Something]_n27 's fallen down in there"", said the chief clerk in the room on the left.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n28 tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to [him]_p309 today could ever happen to the chief clerk too [you]_p310 had to concede that [it]_p311 was possible.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in [his]_p312 highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," From the room on [his]_p313 right,[Gregor]_n29 's sister whispered to [him]_p314 to let [him]_p315 know:""[Gregor]_n30,the chief clerk is here.",2,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," """"Yes,[I]_p316 know"", said [Gregor]_n31 to [himself]_p317 but without daring to raise [his]_p318 voice loud enough for [his]_p319 sister to hear [him]_p320.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Gregor]_n32"", said [his]_p321 father now from the room to [his]_p322 left ,""the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why [you]_p323 didn't leave on the early train.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [We]_p324 don't know what to say to [him]_p325.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," And anyway, [he]_p326 wants to speak to [you]_p327 personally.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, So please open up this door.,0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis, I'm sure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of [your]_p328 room.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Then the chief clerk called""Good morning,[Mr Samsa]_n33"".",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[He]_p329 isn't well"", said [his]_p330 mother to the chief clerk, while [his]_p331 father continued to speak through the door.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[He]_p332 isn't well, please believe [me]_p333.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, Why else would [Gregor]_n34 have missed a train!The lad only ever thinks about the business.,1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis, [It]_p334 nearly makes [me]_p335 cross the way [he]_p336 never goes out in the evenings he's been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p338 sits with [us]_p339 in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [His]_p340 idea of relaxation is working with [his]_p341 fretsaw.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," He's made a little frame,for instance,[it]_p342 only took [him]_p346 two or three evenings,you'll be amazed how nice [it]_p343 is it's hanging up in [his]_p347 room you'll see [it]_p343 as soon as [Gregor]_n35 opens the door.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," Anyway,I'm glad you're here [we]_p348 wouldn't have been able to get [Gregor]_n36 to open the door by [ourselves]_p349 he's so stubborn and I'm sure [he]_p350 isn't well,[he]_p351 said this morning that [he]_p351 is,but [he]_p352 isn't.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," """"I'll be there in a moment"", said [Gregor]_n37 slowly and thoughtfully,but without moving so that [he]_p355 would not miss any word of the conversation.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Well [I]_p356 can't think of any other way of explaining [it]_p358,[Mrs Samsa]_n38"", said the chief clerk ,""[I]_p357 hope it's nothing serious.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," But on the other hand, [I]_p360 must say that if [we]_p361 people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as [you]_p363 like, [we]_p362 simply have to overcome [it]_p364 because of business considerations.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" ""Can the chief clerk come in to see [you]_p365 now then?"", asked [his]_p366 father impatiently, knocking at the door again.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""No"", said [Gregor]_n39.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis, In the room on [his]_p367 right there followed a painful silence in the room on [his]_p368 left [his]_p368 sister began to cry.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, So why did [his]_p370 sister not go and join the others? [She]_p371 had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," And why was [she]_p372 crying? Was [it]_p373 because [he]_p374 had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because [he]_p375 was in danger of losing [his]_p376 job and if that happened [his]_p377 boss would once more pursue [their]_p378 parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that yet.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n40 was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning [his]_p379 family.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," For the time being [he]_p380 just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition [he]_p381 was in would seriously have expected [him]_p382 to let the chief clerk in.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p383 was only a minor discourtesy,and a suitable excuse could easily be found for [it]_p384 later on,[it]_p385 was not something for which [Gregor]_n41 could be sacked on the spot.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, And [it]_p386 seemed to [Gregor]_n42 much more sensible to leave [him]_p387 now in peace instead of disturbing [him]_p388 with talking at [him]_p388 and crying.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," But the others didn't know what was happening, [they]_p390 were worried, that would excuse [their]_p391 behaviour.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," The chief clerk now raised [his]_p392 voice ,""[Mr Samsa]_n43"", [he]_p393 called to [him]_p394 ,""what is wrong?[You]_p395 barricade [yourself]_p396 in [your]_p397 room,give [us]_p400 no more than yes or no for an answer,[you]_p401 are causing serious and unnecessary concern to [your]_p398 parents and [you]_p402 fail - and [I]_p404 mention this just by the way - [you]_p402 fail to carry out [your]_p398 business duties in a way that is quite unheard of.",1,,13,
kafka_metamorphosis," I'm speaking here on behalf of [your]_p405 parents and of [your]_p406 employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation.",0,,2,

kafka_metamorphosis," This morning, [your]_p412 employer did suggest a possible reason for [your]_p413 failure to appear, it's true - [it]_p414 had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to [you]_p416 - but [I]_p417 came near to giving [him]_p418 [my]_p419 word of honour that that could not be the right explanation.",0,,7,

kafka_metamorphosis," It's shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! [I]_p441 was quite alright last night, [my]_p443 parents know about [it]_p444, perhaps better than [me]_p446, [I]_p442 had a small symptom of [it]_p445 last night already.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis, [They]_p447 must have noticed [it]_p448.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [I]_p449 don't know why [I]_p450 didn't let [you]_p451 know at work! But [you]_p452 always think [you]_p452 can get over an illness without staying at home.,0,,5,

kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p469 really did want to open the door, really did want to let [them]_p470 see [him]_p471 and to speak with the chief clerk the others were being so insistent, and [he]_p473 was curious to learn what [they]_p474 would say when [they]_p475 caught sight of [him]_p472.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis, If [they]_p476 were shocked then [it]_p477 would no longer be [Gregor]_n47 's responsibility and [he]_p478 could rest.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," If, however, [they]_p479 took everything calmly [he]_p480 would still have no reason to be upset, and if [he]_p481 hurried [he]_p481 really could be at the station for eight o'clock.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," The first few times [he]_p483 tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers [he]_p484 just slid down again, but [he]_p484 finally gave [himself]_p487 one last swing and stood there upright the lower part of [his]_p488 body was in serious pain but [he]_p485 no longer gave any attention to [it]_p489.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis, Now [he]_p490 let [himself]_p491 fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of [it]_p492 with [his]_p493 little legs.,0,,4,

kafka_metamorphosis, How had [his]_p511 sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again [they]_p512 must have left [it]_p513 open people often do in homes where something awful has happened.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n56,in contrast,had become much calmer.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," So [they]_p514 couldn't understand [his]_p516 words any more, although [they]_p515 seemed clear enough to [him]_p518, clearer than before - perhaps [his]_p517 ears had become used to the sound.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p519 had realised, though, that there was something wrong with [him]_p520, and were ready to help.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," The first response to [his]_p521 situation had been confident and wise, and that made [him]_p522 feel better.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p523 felt that [he]_p524 had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith [he]_p525 expected great and surprising achievements - although [he]_p525 did not really distinguish one from the other.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make [his]_p527 voice as clear as possible, [he]_p528 coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and [he]_p529 was no longer sure [he]_p529 could judge this for [himself]_p531.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," Meanwhile, [it]_p532 had become very quiet in the next room.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Perhaps [his]_p533 parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps [they]_p534 were all pressed against the door and listening.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n57 slowly pushed [his]_p535 way over to the door with the chair.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Once there [he]_p536 let go of [it]_p537 and threw [himself]_p539 onto the door, holding [himself]_p540 upright against [it]_p538 using the adhesive on the tips of [his]_p541 legs.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p542 rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set [himself]_p543 to the task of turning the key in the lock with [his]_p544 mouth.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p545 seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth - how was [he]_p546, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw using the jaw, [he]_p547 really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that [he]_p547 must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from [his]_p549 mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Listen]_n58"", said the chief clerk in the next room ,""he's turning the key.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Gregor]_n59 was greatly encouraged by this but [they]_p550 all should have been calling to [him]_p553,[his]_p554 father and [his]_p555 mother too:""Well done,[Gregor]_n60"", [they]_p551 should have cried ,""keep at [it]_p558,keep hold of the lock !""And with the idea that [they]_p551 were all excitedly following [his]_p555 efforts,[he]_p559 bit on the key with all [his]_p556 strength,paying no attention to the pain [he]_p560 was causing [himself]_p561.",2,,12,
kafka_metamorphosis," As the key turned round [he]_p562 turned around the lock with [it]_p563, only holding [himself]_p565 upright with [his]_p566 mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed [it]_p564 down again with the whole weight of [his]_p567 body as needed.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," The clear sound of the lock as [it]_p568 snapped back was [Gregor]_n61 's sign that [he]_p569 could break [his]_p572 concentration,and as [he]_p570 regained [his]_p573 breath [he]_p570 said to himself:""So,[I]_p574 didn't need the locksmith after all"".",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis, Then [he]_p575 lay [his]_p576 head on the handle of the door to open [it]_p577 completely.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," Because [he]_p578 had to open the door in this way, [it]_p580 was already wide open before [he]_p579 could be seen.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p581 had first to slowly turn [himself]_p582 around one of the double doors, and [he]_p583 had to do [it]_p585 very carefully if [he]_p584 did not want to fall flat on [his]_p586 back before entering the room.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p587 was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when [he]_p588 heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud ""Oh!"", which sounded like the soughing of the wind.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, Now [he]_p589 also saw [him]_p591 - [he]_p590 was the nearest to the door - [his]_p592 hand pressed against [his]_p593 open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.,0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n62 's mother,[her]_p594 hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there,looked at [his]_p595 father.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then [she]_p596 unfolded [her]_p597 arms,took two steps forward towards [Gregor]_n63 and sank down onto the floor into [her]_p598 skirts that spread [themselves]_p602 out around [her]_p598 as [her]_p599 head disappeared down onto [her]_p599 breast.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p603 father looked hostile,and clenched [his]_p604 fists as if wanting to knock [Gregor]_n64 back into [his]_p605 room.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then [he]_p606 looked uncertainly round the living room, covered [his]_p607 eyes with [his]_p608 hands and wept so that [his]_p608 powerful chest shook.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," So [Gregor]_n65 did not go into the room,but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," In this way only half of [his]_p610 body could be seen, along with [his]_p611 head above [it]_p612 which [he]_p613 leant over to one side as [he]_p614 peered out at the others.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," Meanwhile the day had become much lighter part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a hospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing [its]_p615 facade the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," The washing up from breakfast lay on the table there was so much of [it]_p616 because,for [Gregor]_n66 's father,breakfast was the most important meal of the day and [he]_p618 would stretch [it]_p617 out for several hours as [he]_p619 sat reading a number of different newspapers.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of [Gregor]_n67 when [he]_p620 was a lieutenant in the army,[his]_p622 sword in [his]_p623 hand and a carefree smile on [his]_p623 face as [he]_p621 called forth respect for [his]_p624 uniform and bearing.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis, The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open [he]_p626 could see onto the landing and the stairs where [they]_p627 began [their]_p628 way down below.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Now,then"", said [Gregor]_n68,well aware that [he]_p629 was the only one to have kept calm ,""I'll get dressed straight away now,pack up [my]_p630 samples and set off.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Will [you]_p631 please just let [me]_p632 leave? [You]_p633 can see"", [he]_p634 said to the chief clerk, ""that I'm not stubborn and [I]_p635 like to do [my]_p638 job being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling [I]_p636 couldn't earn [my]_p639 living.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," So where are [you]_p640 going, in to the office? Yes? Will [you]_p641 report everything accurately, then? It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that's just the right time to remember what's been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, [he]_p642 will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt to [our]_p646 employer as well as having to look after [my]_p647 parents and [my]_p648 sister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but [I]_p643 will work [my]_p648 way out of [it]_p650 again.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Please don't make things any harder for [me]_p651 than [they]_p653 are already, and don't take sides against [me]_p652 at the office.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [I]_p654 know that nobody likes the travellers.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, [They]_p655 think [we]_p656 earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of [it]_p657.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, That's just prejudice but [they]_p658 have no particular reason to think better of [it]_p659.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," But [you]_p660, sir, [you]_p661 have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if [I]_p662 can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss [himself]_p663 - it's very easy for a businessman like [him]_p664 to make mistakes about [his]_p665 employees and judge [them]_p666 more harshly than [he]_p667 should.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," And you're also well aware that [we]_p668 travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that [we]_p669 can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it's almost impossible to defend [yourself]_p673 from that sort of thing, [we]_p669 don't usually even hear about [them]_p674, or if at all it's when [we]_p670 arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when [we]_p670 feel the harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing what caused [them]_p675.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," Please,don't go away,at least first say something to show that [you]_p676 grant that I'm at least partly right !""But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as [Gregor]_n69 had started to speak,and,with protruding lips,only stared back at [him]_p677 over [his]_p678 trembling shoulders as [he]_p679 left.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p680 did not keep still for a moment while [Gregor]_n70 was speaking,but moved steadily towards the door without taking [his]_p681 eyes off [him]_p682.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p683 moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p684 was only when [he]_p685 had reached the entrance hall that [he]_p686 made a sudden movement, drew [his]_p687 foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," In the hall, [he]_p688 stretched [his]_p689 right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save [him]_p690.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n71 realised that [it]_p691 was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if [his]_p692 position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," That was something [his]_p693 parents did not understand very well over the years,[they]_p695 had become convinced that this job would provide for [Gregor]_n72 for [his]_p694 entire life,and besides,[they]_p696 had so much to worry about at present that [they]_p696 had lost sight of any thought for the future.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n73,though,did think about the future.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," The chief clerk had to be held back,calmed down,convinced and finally won over the future of [Gregor]_n74 and [his]_p698 family depended on [it]_p701!If only [his]_p699 sister were here![She]_p702 was clever [she]_p703 was already in tears while [Gregor]_n75 was still lying peacefully on [his]_p699 back.",2,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely [she]_p704 could persuade [him]_p706  [she]_p705 would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk [him]_p707 out of [his]_p708 shocked state.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," But [his]_p709 sister was not there,[Gregor]_n76 would have to do the job [himself]_p710.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," And without considering that [he]_p711 still was not familiar with how well [he]_p712 could move about in [his]_p715 present state,or that [his]_p716 speech still might not - or probably would not - be understood,[he]_p712 let go of the door pushed [himself]_p718 through the opening tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,ridiculously,was holding on to the banister with both hands but [Gregor]_n77 fell immediately over and,with a little scream as [he]_p713 sought something to hold onto,landed on [his]_p716 numerous little legs.",1,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, [he]_p719 began to feel alright with [his]_p723 body the little legs had the solid ground under [them]_p726 to [his]_p724 pleasure, [they]_p728 did exactly as [he]_p720 told [them]_p727 [they]_p729 were even making the effort to carry [him]_p730 where [he]_p720 wanted to go and [he]_p721 was soon believing that all [his]_p724 sorrows would soon be finally at an end.",0,,12,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p731 held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as [he]_p732 crouched there on the floor.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p733 mother was not far away in front of [him]_p734 and seemed,at first,quite engrossed in [herself]_p735,but then [she]_p736 suddenly jumped up with [her]_p745 arms outstretched and [her]_p746 fingers spread shouting:""Help,for pity's sake,Help !""The way [she]_p737 held [her]_p746 head suggested [she]_p737 wanted to see [Gregor]_n78 better,but the unthinking way [she]_p738 was hurrying backwards showed that [she]_p738 did not [she]_p738 had forgotten that the table was behind [her]_p747 with all the breakfast things on [it]_p749 when [she]_p739 reached the table [she]_p739 sat quickly down on [it]_p750 without knowing what [she]_p739 was doing without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.",1,,18,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Mother]_n79,mother"", said [Gregor]_n80 gently,looking up at [her]_p751.",2,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p752 had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help [himself]_p753 snapping in the air with [his]_p754 jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," That set [his]_p755 mother screaming anew, [she]_p757 fled from the table and into the arms of [his]_p756 father as [he]_p758 rushed towards [her]_p759.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n81,though,had no time to spare for [his]_p760 parents now the chief clerk had already reached the stairs with [his]_p761 chin on the banister,[he]_p762 looked back for the last time.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n82 made a run for [him]_p763 [he]_p765 wanted to be sure of reaching [him]_p764 the chief clerk must have expected something,as [he]_p766 leapt down several steps at once and disappeared [his]_p767 shouts resounding all around the staircase.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," The flight of the chief clerk seemed,unfortunately,to put [Gregor]_n83 's father into a panic as well.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," Until then [he]_p768 had been relatively self controlled,but now,instead of running after the chief clerk [himself]_p771,or at least not impeding [Gregor]_n84 as [he]_p769 ran after [him]_p772,[Gregor]_n85 's father seized the chief clerk's stick in [his]_p774 right hand (the chief clerk had left [it]_p779 behind on a chair,along with [his]_p775 hat and overcoat),picked up a large newspaper from the table with [his]_p775 left,and used [them]_p780 to d[rive G]_n86 regor back into [his]_p776 room,stamping [his]_p776 foot at [him]_p773 as [he]_p769 went.",3,,13,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n87 's appeals to [his]_p781 father were of no help,[his]_p782 appeals were simply not understood,however much [he]_p786 humbly turned [his]_p782 head [his]_p783 father merely stamped [his]_p783 foot all the harder.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Across the room,despite the chilly weather,[Gregor]_n88 's mother had pulled open a window,leant far out of [it]_p787 and pressed [her]_p788 hands to [her]_p789 face.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of [them]_p790 were blown onto the floor.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Nothing would stop [Gregor]_n89 's father as [he]_p791 drove [him]_p792 back,making hissing noises at [him]_p793 like a wild man.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n90 had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly.,1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," If [Gregor]_n91 had only been allowed to turn round [he]_p794 would have been back in [his]_p797 room straight away,but [he]_p795 was afraid that if [he]_p795 took the time to do that [his]_p798 father would become impatient,and there was the threat of a lethal blow to [his]_p798 back or head from the stick in [his]_p799 father's hand any moment.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," Eventually,though,[Gregor]_n92 realised that [he]_p801 had no choice as [he]_p802 saw,to [his]_p805 disgust,that [he]_p802 was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line so [he]_p803 began,as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at [his]_p806 father,to turn [himself]_p807 round.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p808 went very slowly, but perhaps [his]_p809 father was able to see [his]_p810 good intentions as [he]_p812 did nothing to hinder [him]_p814, in fact now and then [he]_p813 used the tip of [his]_p810 stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis, If only [his]_p815 father would stop that unbearable hissing![It]_p816 was making [Gregor]_n93 quite confused.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," When [he]_p817 had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, [he]_p818 made a mistake and turned [himself]_p820 back a little the way [he]_p818 had just come.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p821 was pleased when [he]_p822 finally had [his]_p823 head in front of the doorway, but then saw that [it]_p825 was too narrow, and [his]_p824 body was too broad to get through [it]_p826 without further difficulty.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," In [his]_p827 present mood,[it]_p829 obviously did not occur to [his]_p828 father to open the other of the double doors so that [Gregor]_n94 would have enough space to get through.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p830 was merely fixed on the idea that [Gregor]_n95 should be got back into [his]_p831 room as quickly as possible.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, Nor would [he]_p832 ever have allowed [Gregor]_n96 the time to get [himself]_p833 upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," What [he]_p834 did,making more noise than ever,was to drive [Gregor]_n97 forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way [it]_p835 sounded to [Gregor]_n98 as if there was now more than one father behind [him]_p837 [it]_p836 was not a pleasant experience,[ and G]_n99 regor pushed [himself]_p838 into the doorway without regard for what might happen.",3,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," One side of [his]_p839 body lifted [itself]_p840, [he]_p841 lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on [it]_p843, soon [he]_p842 was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by [himself]_p844, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then [his]_p845 father gave [him]_p847 a hefty shove from behind which released [him]_p848 from where [he]_p850 was held and sent [him]_p848 flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into [his]_p846 room.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet.",0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis, II [It]_p851 was not until [it]_p852 was getting dark that evening that [Gregor]_n100 awoke from [his]_p853 deep and coma-like sleep.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p854 would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if [he]_p855 hadn't been disturbed, as [he]_p856 had had enough sleep and felt fully rested.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, But [he]_p857 had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken [him]_p858.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture,but down below,where [Gregor]_n101 was,[it]_p859 was dark.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p860 pushed [himself]_p861 over to the door, feeling [his]_p862 way clumsily with [his]_p863 antennae - of which [he]_p864 was now beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been happening there.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," The whole of [his]_p865 left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and [he]_p867 limped badly on [his]_p866 two rows of legs.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning - [it]_p868 was nearly a miracle that only one of [them]_p869 had been - and dragged along lifelessly.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [It]_p870 was only when [he]_p871 had reached the door that [he]_p872 realised what [it]_p873 actually was that had drawn [him]_p876 over to [it]_p874 [it]_p875 was the smell of something to eat.,0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis, By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in [it]_p877.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p878 was so pleased [he]_p879 almost laughed, as [he]_p880 was even hungrier than [he]_p880 had been that morning, and immediately dipped [his]_p882 head into the milk, nearly covering [his]_p883 eyes with [it]_p884.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis, But [he]_p885 soon drew [his]_p887 head back again in disappointment not only did the pain in [his]_p888 tender left side make [it]_p890 difficult to eat the food - [he]_p886 was only able to eat if [his]_p888 whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the milk did not taste at all nice.,0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Milk like this was normally [his]_p891 favourite drink, and [his]_p892 sister had certainly left [it]_p894 there for [him]_p895 because of that, but [he]_p896 turned, almost against [his]_p892 own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Through the crack in the door,[Gregor]_n102 could see that the gas had been lit in the living room.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p897 father at this time would normally be sat with [his]_p898 evening paper,reading [it]_p900 out in a loud voice to [Gregor]_n103 's mother,and sometimes to [his]_p899 sister,but there was now not a sound to be heard.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n104 's sister would often write and tell [him]_p901 about this reading,but maybe [his]_p902 father had lost the habit in recent times.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p903 was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""What a quiet life [it]_p904 is the family lead"", said [Gregor]_n105 to [himself]_p905,and,gazing into the darkness,felt a great pride that [he]_p906 was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for [his]_p907 sister and parents.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," But what now,if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end?That was something that [Gregor]_n106 did not want to think about too much,so [he]_p908 started to move about,crawling up and down the room.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again later on the door on the other side did the same [it]_p909 seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of [it]_p910.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n107 went and waited immediately by the door,resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who [it]_p911 was but the door was opened no more that night and [Gregor]_n108 waited in vain.",2,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to [him]_p912, but now, now that [he]_p913 had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p914 was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now [it]_p915 was easy to see that [his]_p916 parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as [they]_p917 all could be distinctly heard as [they]_p918 went away together on tip-toe.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, [It]_p919 was clear that no-one would come into [Gregor]_n109 's room any more until morning that gave [him]_p920 plenty of time to think undisturbed about how [he]_p921 would have to re-arrange [his]_p922 life.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," For some reason, the tall, empty room where [he]_p923 was forced to remain made [him]_p926 feel uneasy as [he]_p924 lay there flat on the floor, even though [he]_p924 had been living in [it]_p927 for five years.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," Hardly aware of what [he]_p928 was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, [he]_p929 hurried under the couch.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p930 pressed down on [his]_p931 back a little, and [he]_p935 was no longer able to lift [his]_p932 head, but [he]_p936 nonetheless felt immediately at ease and [his]_p932 only regret was that [his]_p933 body was too broad to get [it]_p937 all underneath.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p938 spent the whole night there.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Some of the time [he]_p939 passed in a light sleep, although [he]_p940 frequently woke from [it]_p944 in alarm because of [his]_p945 hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being [he]_p940 must remain calm, [he]_p941 must show patience and the greatest consideration so that [his]_p946 family could bear the unpleasantness that [he]_p941, in [his]_p946 present condition, was forced to impose on [them]_p948.",0,,10,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n110 soon had the opportunity to test the strength of [his]_p949 decisions,as early the next morning,almost before the night had ended,[his]_p950 sister,nearly fully dressed,opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p951 did not see [him]_p952 straight away, but when [she]_p954 did notice [him]_p953 under the couch - [he]_p957 had to be somewhere, for God's sake, [he]_p958 couldn't have flown away - [she]_p955 was so shocked that [she]_p955 lost control of [herself]_p959 and slammed the door shut again from outside.",0,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis," But [she]_p960 seemed to regret [her]_p962 behaviour, as [she]_p961 opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n111 had pushed [his]_p963 head forward,right to the edge of the couch,and watched [her]_p964.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Would [she]_p965 notice that [he]_p967 had left the milk as [it]_p970 was, realise that [it]_p971 was not from any lack of hunger and bring [him]_p974 in some other food that was more suitable? If [she]_p966 didn't do [it]_p971 [herself]_p975 [he]_p968 would rather go hungry than draw [her]_p976 attention to [it]_p972, although [he]_p968 did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw [himself]_p978 at [his]_p979 sister's feet and beg [her]_p977 for something good to eat.",0,,15,
kafka_metamorphosis," However, [his]_p980 sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at [it]_p981 and the few drops of milk splashed around [it]_p982 with some surprise.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p983 immediately picked [it]_p984 up - using a rag, not [her]_p986 bare hands - and carried [it]_p985 out.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n112 was extremely curious as to what [she]_p987 would bring in [its]_p988 place,imagining the wildest possibilities,but [he]_p989 never could have guessed what [his]_p990 sister,in [her]_p991 goodness,actually did bring.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," In order to test [his]_p992 taste, [she]_p993 brought [him]_p994 a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," There were old,half-rotten vegetables bones from the evening meal,covered in white sauce that had gone hard a few raisins and almonds some cheese that [Gregor]_n113 had declared inedible two days before a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," As well as all that [she]_p995 had poured some water into the dish,which had probably been permanently set aside for [Gregor]_n114 's use,and placed [it]_p996 beside [them]_p997.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then,out of consideration for [Gregor]_n115 's feelings,as [she]_p998 knew that [he]_p1000 would not eat in front of [her]_p1003,[she]_p999 hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that [Gregor]_n116 would know [he]_p1001 could make things as comfortable for [himself]_p1004 as [he]_p1001 liked.",2,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n117 's little legs whirred,at last [he]_p1005 could eat.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," What's more, [his]_p1006 injuries must already have completely healed as [he]_p1007 found no difficulty in moving.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," This amazed [him]_p1008, as more than a month earlier [he]_p1009 had cut [his]_p1011 finger slightly with a knife, [he]_p1010 thought of how [his]_p1012 finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Am [I]_p1013 less sensitive than [I]_p1014 used to be, then?"", [he]_p1015 thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted [him]_p1016 much more than the other foods on the newspaper.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," Quickly one after another, [his]_p1017 eyes watering with pleasure, [he]_p1018 consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce the fresh foods, on the other hand, [he]_p1019 didn't like at all, and even dragged the things [he]_p1019 did want to eat a little way away from [them]_p1022 because [he]_p1020 couldn't stand the smell.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Long after [he]_p1023 had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, [his]_p1025 sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to [him]_p1026 that [he]_p1024 should withdraw.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1027 was immediately startled, although [he]_p1028 had been half asleep, and [he]_p1029 hurried back under the couch.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," But [he]_p1030 needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that [his]_p1032 sister was in the room, as eating so much food had rounded out [his]_p1033 body a little and [he]_p1031 could hardly breathe in that narrow space.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," Half suffocating, [he]_p1034 watched with bulging eyes as [his]_p1036 sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing [them]_p1037 in with the food [he]_p1035 had not even touched at all as if [it]_p1038 could not be used any more.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p1039 quickly dropped [it]_p1040 all into a bin, closed [it]_p1041 with [its]_p1042 wooden lid, and carried everything out.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, [She]_p1043 had hardly turned [her]_p1044 back before [Gregor]_n118 came out again from under the couch and stretched [himself]_p1045.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," This was how [Gregor]_n119 received [his]_p1046 food each day now,once in the morning while [his]_p1047 parents and the maid were still asleep,and the second time after everyone had eaten [their]_p1049 meal at midday as [his]_p1047 parents would sleep for a little while then as well,and [Gregor]_n120 's sister would send the maid away on some errand.",2,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n121 's father and mother certainly did not want [him]_p1050 to starve either,but perhaps [it]_p1051 would have been more than [they]_p1053 could stand to have any more experience of [his]_p1055 feeding than being told about [it]_p1052,and perhaps [his]_p1056 sister wanted to spare [them]_p1057 what distress [she]_p1058 could as [they]_p1054 were indeed suffering enough.",1,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis, [It]_p1059 was impossible for [Gregor]_n122 to find out what [they]_p1060 had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get [them]_p1061 out of the flat.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," As nobody could understand [him]_p1062, nobody, not even [his]_p1063 sister, thought that [he]_p1066 could understand [them]_p1068, so [he]_p1067 had to be content to hear [his]_p1064 sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as [she]_p1069 moved about [his]_p1064 room.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p1070 was only later,when [she]_p1071 had become a little more used to everything - there was,of course,no question of [her]_p1072 ever becoming fully used to the situation - that [Gregor]_n123 would sometimes catch a friendly comment,or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""He's enjoyed [his]_p1073 dinner today"", [she]_p1074 might say when [he]_p1076 had diligently cleared away all the food left for [him]_p1078, or if [he]_p1077 left most of [it]_p1079, which slowly became more and more frequent, [she]_p1075 would often say, sadly, ""now everything's just been left there again"".",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," Although [Gregor]_n124 wasn't able to hear any news directly [he]_p1080 did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms,and whenever [he]_p1081 heard anyone speaking [he]_p1081 would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press [his]_p1083 whole body against [it]_p1084.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about [him]_p1085 in some way, even if only in secret.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what [they]_p1086 should do now but even between meals [they]_p1087 spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by [themselves]_p1088 and [it]_p1089 was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, And on the very first day the maid had fallen to [her]_p1090 knees and begged [Gregor]_n125 's mother to let [her]_p1091 go without delay.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p1092 was not very clear how much [she]_p1093 knew of what had happened but [she]_p1094 left within a quarter of an hour,tearfully thanking [Gregor]_n126 's mother for [her]_p1096 dismissal as if [she]_p1094 had done [her]_p1097 an enormous service.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p1098 even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of [her]_p1099.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, Now [Gregor]_n127 's sister also had to help [his]_p1100 mother with the cooking although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n128 often heard how one of [them]_p1101 would unsuccessfully urge another to eat,and receive no more answer than""no thanks,I've had enough""or something similar.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, No-one drank very much either.,0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1102 sister would sometimes ask [his]_p1103 father whether [he]_p1104 would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch [it]_p1105 [herself]_p1106.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," When [his]_p1107 father then said nothing [she]_p1109 would add, so that [he]_p1111 would not feel selfish, that [she]_p1110 could send the housekeeper for [it]_p1112, but then [his]_p1108 father would close the matter with a big, loud ""No"", and no more would be said.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Even before the first day had come to an end,[his]_p1113 father had explained to [Gregor]_n129 's mother and sister what [their]_p1114 finances and prospects were.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, Now and then [he]_p1115 stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box [he]_p1116 had saved from [his]_p1117 business when [it]_p1118 had collapsed five years earlier.,0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n130 heard how [he]_p1119 opened the complicated lock and then closed [it]_p1122 again after [he]_p1120 had taken the item [he]_p1120 wanted.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, What [he]_p1123 heard [his]_p1125 father say was some of the first good news that [Gregor]_n131 heard since [he]_p1124 had first been incarcerated in [his]_p1126 room.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1127 had thought that nothing at all remained from [his]_p1128 father's business,at least [he]_p1129 had never told [him]_p1130 anything different,and [Gregor]_n132 had never asked [him]_p1131 about [it]_p1132 anyway.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Their]_p1133 business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair,and [Gregor]_n133 's only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that [they]_p1134 could all forget about [it]_p1135 as quickly as possible.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," So then [he]_p1136 started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour that raised [him]_p1137 from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with [it]_p1138 the chance to earn money in quite different ways.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n134 converted [his]_p1139 success at work straight into cash that [he]_p1141 could lay on the table at home for the benefit of [his]_p1140 astonished and delighted family.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p1142 had been good times and [they]_p1143 had never come again,at least not with the same splendour,even though [Gregor]_n135 had later earned so much that [he]_p1144 was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family,and did bear [them]_p1145.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p1146 had even got used to [it]_p1147,both [Gregor]_n136 and the family,[they]_p1149 took the money with gratitude and [he]_p1150 was glad to provide [it]_p1148,although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n137 only remained close to [his]_p1151 sister now.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Unlike [him]_p1152, [she]_p1153 was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, [it]_p1154 was [his]_p1156 secret plan to send [her]_p1157 to the conservatory next year even though [it]_p1155 would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," During [Gregor]_n138 's short periods in town,conversation with [his]_p1158 sister would often turn to the conservatory but [it]_p1159 was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Their]_p1160 parents did not like to hear this innocent talk,but [Gregor]_n139 thought about [it]_p1161 quite hard and decided [he]_p1163 would let [them]_p1165 know what [he]_p1164 planned with a grand announcement of [it]_p1162 on [Christmas]_n140 day.",2,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through [his]_p1166 mind in [his]_p1167 present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," There were times when [he]_p1168 simply became too tired to continue listening, when [his]_p1171 head would fall wearily against the door and [he]_p1169 would pull [it]_p1172 up again with a start, as even the slightest noise [he]_p1169 caused would be heard next door and [they]_p1173 would all go silent.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""What's that he's doing now"", [his]_p1174 father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," When explaining things,[his]_p1175 father repeated [himself]_p1176 several times,partly because [it]_p1178 was a long time since [he]_p1179 had been occupied with these matters [himself]_p1177 and partly because [Gregor]_n141 's mother did not understand everything the first time.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," From these repeated explanations [Gregor]_n142 learned,to [his]_p1180 pleasure,that despite all [their]_p1181 misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p1182 was not a lot, but [it]_p1183 had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Besides that,[they]_p1184 had not been using up all the money that [Gregor]_n143 had been bringing home every month,keeping only a little for [himself]_p1185,so that that,too,had been accumulating.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Behind the door,[Gregor]_n144 nodded with enthusiasm in [his]_p1186 pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1187 could actually have used this surplus money to reduce [his]_p1188 father's debt to [his]_p1189 boss, and the day when [he]_p1191 could have freed [himself]_p1192 from that job would have come much closer, but now [it]_p1193 was certainly better the way [his]_p1189 father had done things.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest [it]_p1194 was enough to maintain [them]_p1195 for, perhaps, one or two years, no more.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," That's to say, [it]_p1196 was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies  money to live on had to be earned.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1197 father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, During the five years that [he]_p1198 had not been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success - [he]_p1199 had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Would [Gregor]_n145 's elderly mother now have to go and earn money?[She]_p1200 suffered from asthma and [it]_p1201 was a strain for [her]_p1202 just to move about the home,every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," Would [his]_p1203 sister have to go and earn money? [She]_p1204 was still a child of seventeen, [her]_p1205 life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," Whenever [they]_p1206 began to talk of the need to earn money,[Gregor]_n146 would always first let go of the door and then throw [himself]_p1207 onto the cool,leather sofa next to [it]_p1208,as [he]_p1209 became quite hot with shame and regret.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1210 would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Or [he]_p1211 might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of [it]_p1212.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1213 had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this,but doing [it]_p1214 now was obviously something more remembered than experienced,as what [he]_p1216 actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day,even things that were quite near [he]_p1217 had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street,but now [he]_p1217 could not see [it]_p1215 at all,and if [he]_p1218 had not known that [he]_p1218 lived in [Charlottenstrasse]_n147,which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city,[he]_p1218 could have thought that [he]_p1219 was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably.",1,,10,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1223 observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before [she]_p1224 would always push [it]_p1226 back to [its]_p1227 exact position by the window after [she]_p1225 had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, If [Gregor]_n148 had only been able to speak to [his]_p1228 sister and thank [her]_p1229 for all that [she]_p1230 had to do for [him]_p1231 [it]_p1234 would have been easier for [him]_p1232 to bear [it]_p1235 but as [it]_p1235 was [it]_p1236 caused [him]_p1232 pain.,1,,10,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1238 sister,naturally,tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about [it]_p1239,and the longer [it]_p1240 went on,of course,the better [she]_p1242 was able to do so,but as time went by [Gregor]_n149 was also able to see through [it]_p1240 all so much better.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p1243 had even become very unpleasant for [him]_p1244, now, whenever [she]_p1245 entered the room.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," No sooner had [she]_p1246 come in than [she]_p1247 would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into [Gregor]_n150 's room,then [she]_p1247 would go straight to the window and pull [it]_p1250 hurriedly open almost as if [she]_p1248 were suffocating.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," Even if [it]_p1251 was cold, [she]_p1252 would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p1253 would alarm [Gregor]_n151 twice a day with this running about and noise making [he]_p1254 would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,knowing full well that [she]_p1255 would certainly have liked to spare [him]_p1256 this ordeal,but [it]_p1258 was impossible for [her]_p1259 to be in the same room with [him]_p1257 with the windows closed.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," One day,about a month after [Gregor]_n152 's transformation when [his]_p1260 sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at [his]_p1261 appearance,[she]_p1262 came into the room a little earlier than usual and found [him]_p1263 still staring out the window,motionless,and just where [he]_p1264 would be most horrible.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," In [itself]_p1265,[his]_p1266 sister's not coming into the room would have been no surprise for [Gregor]_n153 as [it]_p1267 would have been difficult for [her]_p1268 to immediately open the window while [he]_p1272 was still there,but not only did [she]_p1274 not come in,[she]_p1275 went straight back and closed the door behind [her]_p1269,a stranger would have thought [he]_p1273 had threatened [her]_p1269 and tried to bite [her]_p1270.",1,,11,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n154 went straight to hide [himself]_p1276 under the couch,of course,but [he]_p1277 had to wait until midday before [his]_p1278 sister came back and [she]_p1279 seemed much more uneasy than usual.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p1280 made [him]_p1281 realise that [she]_p1283 still found [his]_p1286 appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, [she]_p1284 probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when [she]_p1284 saw the little bit of [him]_p1282 that protruded from under the couch.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," One day, in order to spare [her]_p1287 even this sight, [he]_p1288 spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on [his]_p1290 back and arranged [it]_p1292 so that [he]_p1289 was completely covered and [his]_p1291 sister would not be able to see [him]_p1293 even if [she]_p1294 bent down.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," If [she]_p1295 did not think this sheet was necessary then all [she]_p1296 had to do was take [it]_p1297 off again,as [it]_p1298 was clear enough that [it]_p1298 was no pleasure for [Gregor]_n155 to cut [himself]_p1300 off so completely.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis, [She]_p1301 left the sheet where [it]_p1302 was.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n156 even thought [he]_p1303 glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when [he]_p1304 carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how [his]_p1305 sister liked the new arrangement.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," For the first fourteen days,[Gregor]_n157 's parents could not bring [themselves]_p1306 to come into the room to see [him]_p1307.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1308 would often hear [them]_p1309 say how [they]_p1310 appreciated all the new work [his]_p1312 sister was doing even though, before, [they]_p1311 had seen [her]_p1313 as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with [her]_p1314.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," But now the two of [them]_p1315,father and mother,would often both wait outside the door of [Gregor]_n158 's room while [his]_p1317 sister tidied up in there,and as soon as [she]_p1318 went out again [she]_p1319 would have to tell [them]_p1316 exactly how everything looked,what [Gregor]_n159 had eaten,how [he]_p1320 had behaved this time and whether,perhaps,any slight improvement could be seen.",2,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis, [His]_p1321 mother also wanted to go in and visit [Gregor]_n160 relatively soon but [his]_p1322 father and sister at first persuaded [her]_p1323 against [it]_p1324.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n161 listened very closely to all this,and approved fully.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," Later,though,[she]_p1325 had to be held back by force,which made [her]_p1328 call out:""Let [me]_p1330 go and see [Gregor]_n162,[he]_p1331 is [my]_p1332 unfortunate son!Can't [you]_p1333 understand [I]_p1334 have to see [him]_p1335 ?"", and [Gregor]_n163 would think to [himself]_p1336 that maybe [it]_p1337 would be better if [his]_p1338 mother came in,not every day of course,but one day a week,perhaps [she]_p1326 could understand everything much better than [his]_p1339 sister who,for all [her]_p1329 courage,was still just a child after all,and really might not have had an adult's appreciation of the burdensome job [she]_p1326 had taken on.",2,,15,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n164 's wish to see [his]_p1340 mother was soon realised.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Out of consideration for [his]_p1341 parents,[Gregor]_n165 wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day,the few square meters of the floor did not give [him]_p1343 much room to crawl about,[it]_p1345 was hard to just lie quietly through the night,[his]_p1342 food soon stopped giving [him]_p1344 any pleasure at all,and so,to entertain [himself]_p1346,[he]_p1347 got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1348 was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling [it]_p1349 was quite different from lying on the floor [he]_p1352 could breathe more freely [his]_p1354 body had a light swing to [it]_p1350 and up there, relaxed and almost happy, [it]_p1350 might happen that [he]_p1353 would surprise even [himself]_p1355 by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," But now, of course, [he]_p1356 had far better control of [his]_p1357 body than before and, even with a fall as great as that, caused [himself]_p1358 no damage.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," Very soon [his]_p1359 sister noticed [Gregor]_n166 's new way of entertaining [himself]_p1362 - [he]_p1363 had,after all,left traces of the adhesive from [his]_p1360 feet as [he]_p1364 crawled about - and got [it]_p1365 into [her]_p1367 head to make [it]_p1366 as easy as possible for [him]_p1368 by removing the furniture that got in [his]_p1360 way,especially the chest of drawers and the desk.",1,,10,
kafka_metamorphosis," Now,this was not something that [she]_p1369 would be able to do by [herself]_p1373 [she]_p1370 did not dare to ask for help from [her]_p1374 father the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but [she]_p1370 certainly would not have helped in this,[she]_p1371 had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless [it]_p1376 was especially important so [his]_p1377 sister had no choice but to choose some time when [Gregor]_n167 's father was not there and fetch [his]_p1378 mother to help [her]_p1375.",1,,10,
kafka_metamorphosis," As [she]_p1379 approached the room,[Gregor]_n168 could hear [his]_p1381 mother express [her]_p1382 joy,but once at the door [she]_p1380 went silent.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," First, of course, [his]_p1383 sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright and only then did [she]_p1384 let [her]_p1385 mother enter.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n169 had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into [it]_p1386 so that everything really looked as if [it]_p1387 had just been thrown down by chance.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n170 also refrained,this time,from spying out from under the sheet [he]_p1388 gave up the chance to see [his]_p1389 mother until later and was simply glad that [she]_p1390 had come.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[You]_p1391 can come in, [he]_p1392 can't be seen"", said [his]_p1393 sister, obviously leading [her]_p1394 in by the hand.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about,but [Gregor]_n171 listened as [they]_p1395 pushed [it]_p1396 from [its]_p1397 place,[his]_p1398 sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for [herself]_p1399 and ignoring [her]_p1401 mother's warnings that [she]_p1402 would strain [herself]_p1400.",1,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis, This lasted a very long time.,0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," After labouring at [it]_p1403 for fifteen minutes or more [his]_p1410 mother said [it]_p1404 would be better to leave the chest where [it]_p1404 was,for one thing [it]_p1405 was too heavy for [them]_p1412 to get the job finished before [Gregor]_n172 's father got home and leaving [it]_p1405 in the middle of the room [it]_p1405 would be in [his]_p1411 way even more,and for another thing [it]_p1406 wasn't even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to [him]_p1413.",1,,11,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p1414 thought just the opposite the sight of the bare walls saddened [her]_p1415 right to [her]_p1416 heart and why wouldn't [Gregor]_n173 feel the same way about [it]_p1417,he'd been used to this furniture in [his]_p1419 room for a long time and [it]_p1418 would make [him]_p1420 feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then,quietly,almost whispering as if wanting [Gregor]_n174 (whose whereabouts [she]_p1421 did not know) to hear not even the tone of [her]_p1424 voice,as [she]_p1422 was convinced that [he]_p1426 did not understand [her]_p1425 words,[she]_p1422 added""and by taking the furniture away,won't [it]_p1429 seem like we're showing that we've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning [him]_p1432 to cope for [himself]_p1433?[I]_p1434 think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the way [it]_p1430 was before so that when [Gregor]_n175 comes back to [us]_p1435 again he'll find everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in between all the easier"".",2,,12,
kafka_metamorphosis," Hearing these words from [his]_p1436 mother made [Gregor]_n176 realise that the lack of any direct human communication,along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months,must have made [him]_p1438 confused - [he]_p1439 could think of no other way of explaining to [himself]_p1441 why [he]_p1440 had seriously wanted [his]_p1437 room emptied out.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Had [he]_p1442 really wanted to transform [his]_p1445 room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture [he]_p1443 had inherited? That would have let [him]_p1447 crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but [it]_p1449 would also have let [him]_p1448 quickly forget [his]_p1446 past when [he]_p1443 had still been human.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1450 had come very close to forgetting, and [it]_p1451 had only been the voice of [his]_p1453 mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken [him]_p1454 out of [it]_p1452.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, Nothing should be removed everything had to stay [he]_p1455 could not do without the good influence the furniture had on [his]_p1456 condition and if the furniture made [it]_p1457 difficult for [him]_p1458 to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.,0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1459 sister,unfortunately,did not agree [she]_p1460 had become used to the idea,not without reason,that [she]_p1461 was [Gregor]_n177 's spokesman to [his]_p1462 parents about the things that concerned [him]_p1463.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," This meant that [his]_p1464 mother's advice now was sufficient reason for [her]_p1465 to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as [she]_p1466 had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p1467 was more than childish perversity,of course,or the unexpected confidence [she]_p1468 had recently acquired,that made [her]_p1470 insist [she]_p1469 had indeed noticed that [Gregor]_n178 needed a lot of room to crawl about in,whereas the furniture,as far as anyone could see,was of no use to [him]_p1471 at all.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel [they]_p1472 must get [their]_p1474 way whenever [they]_p1473 can.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, Perhaps this was what tempted [Grete]_n179 to make [Gregor]_n180 's situation seem even more shocking than [it]_p1475 was so that [she]_p1476 could do even more for [him]_p1477.,2,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Grete]_n181 would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by [Gregor]_n182 crawling about the bare walls by [himself]_p1478.,2,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, So [she]_p1479 refused to let [her]_p1480 mother dissuade [her]_p1481.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n183 's mother already looked uneasy in [his]_p1482 room,[she]_p1483 soon stopped speaking and helped [Gregor]_n184 's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength [she]_p1484 had.",2,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," The chest of drawers was something that [Gregor]_n185 could do without if [he]_p1485 had to,but the writing desk had to stay.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers,groaning,out of the room than [Gregor]_n186 poked [his]_p1486 head out from under the couch to see what [he]_p1487 could do about [it]_p1488.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1489 meant to be as careful and considerate as [he]_p1490 could,but,unfortunately,[it]_p1491 was [his]_p1494 mother who came back first while [Grete]_n187 in the next room had [her]_p1495 arms round the chest,pushing and pulling at [it]_p1492 from side to side by [herself]_p1496 without,of course,moving [it]_p1492 an inch.",1,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1497 mother was not used to the sight of [Gregor]_n188,[he]_p1498 might have made [her]_p1499 ill,so [Gregor]_n189 hurried backwards to the far end of the couch.",2,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," In [his]_p1500 startlement, though, [he]_p1501 was not able to prevent the sheet at [its]_p1502 front from moving a little.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [It]_p1503 was enough to attract [his]_p1504 mother's attention.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p1505 stood very still,remained there a moment,and then went back out to [Grete]_n190.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n191 kept trying to assure [himself]_p1506 that nothing unusual was happening,[it]_p1507 was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,but [he]_p1508 soon had to admit that the women going to and fro,[their]_p1510 little calls to each other,the scraping of the furniture on the floor,all these things made [him]_p1511 feel as if [he]_p1509 were being assailed from all sides.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," With [his]_p1512 head and legs pulled in against [him]_p1514 and [his]_p1513 body pressed to the floor, [he]_p1515 was forced to admit to [himself]_p1517 that [he]_p1516 could not stand all of this much longer.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p1518 were emptying [his]_p1519 room out taking away everything that was dear to [him]_p1522 [they]_p1523 had already taken out the chest containing [his]_p1520 fretsaw and other tools  now [they]_p1524 threatened to remove the writing desk with [its]_p1525 place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where [he]_p1526 had done [his]_p1520 homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while [he]_p1527 had been at infant school, [he]_p1527 really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women's intentions were good.",0,,11,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1529 had nearly forgotten [they]_p1530 were there anyway, as [they]_p1531 were now too tired to say anything while [they]_p1531 worked and [he]_p1534 could only hear [their]_p1535 feet as [they]_p1532 stepped heavily on the floor.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching [their]_p1536 breath, [he]_p1537 sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what [he]_p1538 should save first before [his]_p1539 attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was already denuded of everything else that had been on [it]_p1540 - of the lady dressed in copious fur.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1541 hurried up onto the picture and pressed [himself]_p1542 against [its]_p1543 glass, [it]_p1544 held [him]_p1545 firmly and felt good on [his]_p1546 hot belly.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," This picture at least,now totally covered by [Gregor]_n192,would certainly be taken away by no-one.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p1547 turned [his]_p1548 head to face the door into the living room so that [he]_p1549 could watch the women when [they]_p1550 came back.,0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, [They]_p1551 had not allowed [themselves]_p1552 a long rest and came back quite soon [Grete]_n193 had put [her]_p1553 arm around [her]_p1554 mother and was nearly carrying [her]_p1554.,1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""What shall [we]_p1556 take now,then ?"", said [Grete]_n194 and looked around.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Her]_p1557 eyes met those of [Gregor]_n195 on the wall.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Perhaps only because [her]_p1558 mother was there,[she]_p1563 remained calm,bent [her]_p1559 face to [her]_p1559 so that [she]_p1564 would not look round and said,albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in [her]_p1560 voice:""Come on,let's go back in the living room for a while ?""[Gregor]_n196 could see what [Grete]_n197 had in mind,[she]_p1564 wanted to take [her]_p1560 mother somewhere safe and then chase [him]_p1566 down from the wall.",2,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis," Well, [she]_p1567 could certainly try [it]_p1568! [He]_p1569 sat unyielding on [his]_p1570 picture.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p1571 would rather jump at [Grete]_n198 's face.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," But [Grete]_n199 's words had made [her]_p1572 mother quite worried,[she]_p1573 stepped to one side,saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper,and before [she]_p1574 even realised [it]_p1578 was [Gregor]_n200 that [she]_p1574 saw screamed:""Oh God,oh God !""Arms outstretched,[she]_p1575 fell onto the couch as if [she]_p1575 had given up everything and stayed there immobile.",2,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Gregor]_n201 !""shouted [his]_p1579 sister,glowering at [him]_p1580 and shaking [her]_p1581 fist.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, That was the first word [she]_p1582 had spoken to [him]_p1583 directly since [his]_p1584 transformation.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p1585 ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring [her]_p1586 mother out of [her]_p1587 faint [Gregor]_n202 wanted to help too - [he]_p1592 could save [his]_p1598 picture later,although [he]_p1593 stuck fast to the glass and had to pull [himself]_p1600 off by force then [he]_p1593,too,ran into the next room as if [he]_p1594 could advise [his]_p1599 sister like in the old days but [he]_p1594 had to just stand behind [her]_p1587 doing nothing [she]_p1601 was looking into various bottles,[he]_p1594 startled [her]_p1588 when [she]_p1602 turned round a bottle fell to the ground and broke a splinter cut [Gregor]_n203 's face,some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over [him]_p1605 now,without delaying any longer,[Grete]_n204 took hold of all the bottles [she]_p1602 could and ran with [them]_p1606 in to [her]_p1588 mother [she]_p1603 slammed the door shut with [her]_p1588 foot.",3,,22,
kafka_metamorphosis," So now [Gregor]_n205 was shut out from [his]_p1607 mother,who,because of [him]_p1611,might be near to death [he]_p1614 could not open the door if [he]_p1615 did not want to chase [his]_p1608 sister away,and [she]_p1619 had to stay with [his]_p1608 mother there was nothing for [him]_p1612 to do but wait and,oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach,[he]_p1615 began to crawl about,[he]_p1616 crawled over everything,walls,furniture,ceiling,and finally in [his]_p1609 confusion as the whole room began to spin around [him]_p1612 [he]_p1616 fell down into the middle of the dinner table.",1,,13,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1620 lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around [him]_p1621 [it]_p1622 was quiet, maybe that was a good sign.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, Then there was someone at the door.,0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," The maid,of course,had locked [herself]_p1623 in [her]_p1624 kitchen so that [Grete]_n206 would have to go and answer [it]_p1625.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [His]_p1626 father had arrived home.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""What's happened ?""were [his]_p1627 first words [Grete]_n207 's appearance must have made everything clear to [him]_p1628.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p1629 answered [him]_p1630 with subdued voice,and openly pressed [her]_p1631 face into [his]_p1632 chest:""[Mother]_n208 's fainted,but she's better now.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n209 got out.,1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" ""Just as [I]_p1633 expected"", said [his]_p1635 father, ""just as [I]_p1634 always said, but [you]_p1636 women wouldn't listen, would [you]_p1637.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[It]_p1638 was clear to [Gregor]_n210 that [Grete]_n211 had not said enough and that [his]_p1639 father took [it]_p1640 to mean that something bad had happened,that [he]_p1641 was responsible for some act of violence.",2,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," That meant [Gregor]_n212 would now have to try to calm [his]_p1642 father,as [he]_p1643 did not have the time to explain things to [him]_p1644 even if that had been possible.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," So [he]_p1645 fled to the door of [his]_p1648 room and pressed [himself]_p1651 against [it]_p1652 so that [his]_p1649 father,when [he]_p1646 came in from the hall,could see straight away that [Gregor]_n213 had the best intentions and would go back into [his]_p1649 room without delay,that [it]_p1653 would not be necessary to drive [him]_p1654 back but that [they]_p1655 had only to open the door and [he]_p1646 would disappear.",1,,11,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1656 father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that ""Ah!"", [he]_p1657 shouted as [he]_p1658 came in, sounding as if [he]_p1658 were both angry and glad at the same time.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n214 drew [his]_p1660 head back from the door and lifted [it]_p1662 towards [his]_p1661 father.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1663 really had not imagined [his]_p1664 father the way [he]_p1666 stood there now of late, with [his]_p1665 new habit of crawling about, [he]_p1667 had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way [he]_p1667 had done before.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1669 really ought to have expected things to have changed,but still,still,was that really [his]_p1670 father?The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in [his]_p1671 bed when [Gregor]_n215 came back from [his]_p1671 business trips,who would receive [him]_p1682 sitting in the armchair in [his]_p1672 nightgown when [he]_p1684 came back in the evenings who was hardly even able to stand up but,as a sign of [his]_p1672 pleasure,would just raise [his]_p1672 arms and who,on the couple of times a year when [they]_p1686 went for a walk together on a [Sunday]_n216 or public holiday wrapped up tightly in [his]_p1673 overcoat between [Gregor]_n217 and [his]_p1673 mother,would always labour [his]_p1673 way forward a little more slowly than [them]_p1687,who were already walking slowly for [his]_p1673 sake who would place [his]_p1674 stick down carefully and,if [he]_p1685 wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather [his]_p1674 companions around [him]_p1683.",3,,19,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1688 was standing up straight enough now  dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute above the high, stiff collar of the coat [his]_p1689 strong double-chin emerged under the bushy eyebrows, [his]_p1690 piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert [his]_p1690 normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to [his]_p1691 scalp.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1693 took [his]_p1694 cap,with [its]_p1698 gold monogram from,probably,some bank,and threw [it]_p1699 in an arc right across the room onto the sofa,put [his]_p1695 hands in [his]_p1695 trouser pockets,pushing back the bottom of [his]_p1696 long uniform coat,and,with look of determination,walked towards [Gregor]_n218.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1700 probably did not even know [himself]_p1701 what [he]_p1702 had in mind, but nonetheless lifted [his]_p1703 feet unusually high.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n219 was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of [his]_p1704 boots,but wasted no time with that - [he]_p1707 knew full well,right from the first day of [his]_p1705 new life,that [his]_p1705 father thought [it]_p1708 necessary to always be extremely strict with [him]_p1709.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," And so [he]_p1710 ran up to [his]_p1712 father, stopped when [his]_p1713 father stopped, scurried forwards again when [he]_p1711 moved, even slightly.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," In this way [they]_p1714 went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n220 remained all this time on the floor,largely because [he]_p1715 feared [his]_p1717 father might see [it]_p1718 as especially provoking if [he]_p1716 fled onto the wall or ceiling.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," Whatever [he]_p1719 did,[Gregor]_n221 had to admit that [he]_p1720 certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long,as for each step [his]_p1722 father took [he]_p1720 had to carry out countless movements.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1723 became noticeably short of breath, even in [his]_p1724 earlier life [his]_p1725 lungs had not been very reliable.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," Now, as [he]_p1726 lurched about in [his]_p1730 efforts to muster all the strength [he]_p1727 could for running [he]_p1727 could hardly keep [his]_p1731 eyes open [his]_p1731 thoughts became too slow for [him]_p1733 to think of any other way of saving [himself]_p1737 than running [he]_p1728 almost forgot that the walls were there for [him]_p1734 to use although, here, [they]_p1738 were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions - then, right beside [him]_p1734, lightly tossed, something flew down and rolled in front of [him]_p1735.",0,,13,
kafka_metamorphosis, [It]_p1739 was an apple then another one immediately flew at [him]_p1740 [Gregor]_n222 froze in shock there was no longer any point in running as [his]_p1742 father had decided to bombard [him]_p1741.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1743 had filled [his]_p1744 pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if [they]_p1745 had electric motors.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, An apple thrown without much force glanced against [Gregor]_n223 's back and slid off without doing any harm.,1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," Another one however,immediately following [it]_p1746,hit squarely and lodged in [his]_p1747 back [Gregor]_n224 wanted to drag [himself]_p1750 away,as if [he]_p1752 could remove the surprising,the incredible pain by changing [his]_p1748 position but [he]_p1753 felt as if nailed to the spot and spread [himself]_p1751 out,all [his]_p1748 senses in confusion.",1,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," The last thing [he]_p1754 saw was the door of [his]_p1755 room being pulled open,[his]_p1756 sister was screaming,[his]_p1756 mother ran out in front of [her]_p1763 in [her]_p1764 blouse (as [his]_p1757 sister had taken off some of [her]_p1764 clothes after [she]_p1770 had fainted to make [it]_p1773 easier for [her]_p1765 to breathe),[she]_p1771 ran to [his]_p1757 father,[her]_p1765 skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground,stumbling over the skirts [she]_p1771 pushed [herself]_p1774 to [his]_p1757 father,[her]_p1765 arms around [him]_p1776,uniting [herself]_p1775 with [him]_p1777 totally - now [Gregor]_n225 lost [his]_p1758 ability to see anything - [her]_p1766 hands behind [his]_p1758 father's head begging [him]_p1777 to spare [Gregor]_n226 's life.",2,,25,
kafka_metamorphosis," III No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in [Gregor]_n227 's flesh,so [it]_p1779 remained there as a visible reminder of [his]_p1780 injury.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1781 had suffered [it]_p1782 there for more than a month,and [his]_p1783 condition seemed serious enough to remind even [his]_p1784 father that [Gregor]_n228,despite [his]_p1784 current sad and revolting form,was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for [him]_p1786 and to be patient, just to be patient.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Because of [his]_p1787 injuries,[Gregor]_n229 had lost much of [his]_p1788 mobility - probably permanently.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1789 had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and [it]_p1790 took [him]_p1791 long, long minutes to crawl across [his]_p1792 room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but this deterioration in [his]_p1793 condition was fully (in [his]_p1793 opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1795 got into the habit of closely watching [it]_p1796 for one or two hours before [it]_p1797 was opened and then, lying in the darkness of [his]_p1798 room where [he]_p1799 could not be seen from the living room, [he]_p1800 could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to [their]_p1801 conversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p1802 no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times,of course,the ones that [Gregor]_n230 always thought about with longing when [he]_p1803 was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, All of [them]_p1804 were usually very quiet nowadays.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Soon after dinner, [his]_p1805 father would go to sleep in [his]_p1806 chair [his]_p1806 mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet [his]_p1807 mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop [his]_p1807 sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that [she]_p1810 might be able to get a better position later on.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Sometimes [his]_p1811 father would wake up and say to [Gregor]_n231 's mother""you're doing so much sewing again today !"", as if [he]_p1812 did not know that [he]_p1813 had been dozing - and then [he]_p1813 would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," With a kind of stubbornness,[Gregor]_n232 's father refused to take [his]_p1815 uniform off even at home while [his]_p1816 nightgown hung unused on [its]_p1818 peg [Gregor]_n233 's father would slumber where [he]_p1819 was,fully dressed,as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of [his]_p1816 superior even here.",2,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," The uniform had not been new to start with,but as a result of this [it]_p1820 slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of [Gregor]_n234 's mother and sister to look after [it]_p1821.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n235 would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat,with [its]_p1822 gold buttons always kept polished and shiny,while the old man in [it]_p1823 would sleep,highly uncomfortable but peaceful.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," As soon as [it]_p1824 struck ten,[Gregor]_n236 's mother would speak gently to [his]_p1825 father to wake [him]_p1827 and try to persuade [him]_p1828 to go to bed,as [he]_p1829 couldn't sleep properly where [he]_p1830 was and [he]_p1830 really had to get [his]_p1826 sleep if [he]_p1831 was to be up at six to get to work.",1,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis," But since [he]_p1833 had been in work [he]_p1834 had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though [he]_p1834 regularly fell asleep and [it]_p1836 was then harder than ever to persuade [him]_p1837 to exchange the chair for [his]_p1838 bed.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then, however much mother and sister would importune [him]_p1839 with little reproaches and warnings [he]_p1840 would keep slowly shaking [his]_p1841 head for a quarter of an hour with [his]_p1842 eyes closed and refusing to get up.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n237 's mother would tug at [his]_p1843 sleeve,whisper endearments into [his]_p1844 ear,[Gregor]_n238 's sister would leave [her]_p1845 work to help [her]_p1846 mother,but nothing would have any effect on [him]_p1847.",2,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p1848 would just sink deeper into [his]_p1849 chair.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Only when the two women took [him]_p1850 under the arms [he]_p1853 would abruptly open [his]_p1856 eyes,look at [them]_p1859 one after the other and say:""What a life!This is what peace [I]_p1861 get in [my]_p1862 old age !""And supported by the two women [he]_p1854 would lift [himself]_p1863 up carefully as if [he]_p1854 were carrying the greatest load [himself]_p1864,let the women take [him]_p1851 to the door,send [them]_p1860 off and carry on by [himself]_p1864 while [Gregor]_n239 's mother would throw down [her]_p1866 needle and [his]_p1857 sister [her]_p1867 pen so that [they]_p1868 could run after [his]_p1857 father and continue being of help to [him]_p1851.",1,,19,
kafka_metamorphosis," Who,in this tired and overworked family,would have had time to give more attention to [Gregor]_n240 than was absolutely necessary?The household budget became even smaller so now the maid was dismissed an enormous,thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around [her]_p1869 head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work everything else was looked after by [Gregor]_n241 's mother on top of the large amount of sewing work [she]_p1870 did.",2,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n242 even learned,listening to the evening conversation about what price [they]_p1871 had hoped for,that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold,even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing [them]_p1872 at functions and celebrations.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for [their]_p1873 present circumstances,[they]_p1874 could not move out of [it]_p1875,there was no imaginable way of transferring [Gregor]_n243 to the new address.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1876 could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for [him]_p1877 that made [it]_p1879 difficult for [them]_p1882 to move, [it]_p1880 would have been quite easy to transport [him]_p1878 in any suitable crate with a few air holes in [it]_p1880 the main thing holding the family back from [their]_p1883 decision to move was much more to do with [their]_p1884 total despair, and the thought that [they]_p1885 had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else [they]_p1886 knew or were related to.",0,,11,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p1887 carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people,[Gregor]_n244 's father brought bank employees [their]_p1888 breakfast,[his]_p1889 mother sacrificed [herself]_p1891 by washing clothes for strangers,[his]_p1890 sister ran back and forth behind [her]_p1892 desk at the behest of the customers,but [they]_p1893 just did not have the strength to do any more.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis, And the injury in [Gregor]_n245 's back began to hurt as much as when [it]_p1894 was new.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," After [they]_p1895 had come back from taking [his]_p1898 father to bed [Gregor]_n246 's mother and sister would now leave [their]_p1900 work where [it]_p1902 was and sit close together,cheek to cheek [his]_p1899 mother would point to [Gregor]_n247 's room and say""Close that door,[Grete]_n248"", and then,when [he]_p1903 was in the dark again,[they]_p1896 would sit in the next room and [their]_p1901 tears would mingle,or [they]_p1896 would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.",3,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n249 hardly slept at all,either night or day.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," Sometimes [he]_p1904 would think of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened [he]_p1905 had long forgotten about [his]_p1908 boss and the chief clerk, but [they]_p1912 would appear again in [his]_p1909 thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom [his]_p1909 attention had been serious but too slow, - all of [them]_p1915 appeared to [him]_p1917, mixed together with strangers and others [he]_p1905 had forgotten, but instead of helping [him]_p1918 and [his]_p1910 family [they]_p1913 were all of [them]_p1916 inaccessible, and [he]_p1906 was glad when [they]_p1913 disappeared.",0,,15,
kafka_metamorphosis," Other times [he]_p1919 was not at all in the mood to look after [his]_p1929 family, [he]_p1920 was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention [he]_p1920 was shown, and although [he]_p1921 could think of nothing [he]_p1921 would have wanted, [he]_p1921 made plans of how [he]_p1922 could get into the pantry where [he]_p1922 could take all the things [he]_p1922 was entitled to, even if [he]_p1922 was not hungry.",0,,11,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n250 's sister no longer thought about how [she]_p1930 could please [him]_p1933 but would hurriedly push some food or other into [his]_p1934 room with [her]_p1935 foot before [she]_p1931 rushed out to work in the morning and at midday,and in the evening [she]_p1931 would sweep [it]_p1936 away again with the broom,indifferent as to whether [it]_p1937 had been eaten or - more often than not - had been left totally untouched.",1,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p1938 still cleared up the room in the evening, but now [she]_p1939 could not have been any quicker about [it]_p1940.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth.",0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," At first,[Gregor]_n251 went into one of the worst of these places when [his]_p1941 sister arrived as a reproach to [her]_p1943,but [he]_p1944 could have stayed there for weeks without [his]_p1942 sister doing anything about [it]_p1946 [she]_p1948 could see the dirt as well as [he]_p1945 could but [she]_p1949 had simply decided to leave [him]_p1950 to [it]_p1947.",1,,10,
kafka_metamorphosis, At the same time [she]_p1951 became touchy in a way that was quite new for [her]_p1952 and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up [Gregor]_n252 's room was for [her]_p1953 and [her]_p1953 alone.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n253 's mother did once thoroughly clean [his]_p1955 room,and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do [it]_p1956 - although that much dampness also made [Gregor]_n254 ill and [he]_p1957 lay flat on the couch,bitter and immobile.",2,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," But [his]_p1958 mother was to be punished still more for what [she]_p1960 had done,as hardly had [his]_p1959 sister arrived home in the evening than [she]_p1961 noticed the change in [Gregor]_n255 's room and,highly aggrieved,ran back into the living room where,despite [her]_p1963 mothers raised and imploring hands,[she]_p1961 broke into convulsive tears.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Her]_p1964 father,of course,was startled out of [his]_p1965 chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless then [they]_p1971,too,became agitated [Gregor]_n256 's father,standing to the right of [his]_p1966 mother,accused [her]_p1972 of not leaving the cleaning of [Gregor]_n257 's room to [his]_p1966 sister from [her]_p1973 lef[t,G]_n258 regor's sister screamed at [her]_p1973 that [she]_p1976 was never[ to cl]_n259 ean Gregor's room again while [his]_p1967 mother tried to draw [his]_p1967 father,who was beside [himself]_p1977 with anger,into the bedroom [his]_p1967 sister,quaking with tears,thumped on the table with [her]_p1974 s[mall f]_n260 ists and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save [him]_p1978 the sight of this and all [its]_p1979 noise.",5,,16,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n261 's sister was exhausted from going out to work,and looking after [Gregor]_n262 as [she]_p1980 had done before was even more work for [her]_p1981,but even so [his]_p1983 mother ought certainly not to have taken [her]_p1982 place.",2,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n263,on the other hand,ought not to be neglected.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," Now, though, the charwoman was here.",0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," This elderly widow,with a robust bone structure that made [her]_p1984 able to withstand the hardest of things in [her]_p1985 long life,wasn't really repelled by [Gregor]_n264.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Just by chance one day,rather than any real curiosity,[she]_p1986 opened the door to [Gregor]_n265 's room and found [herself]_p1987 face to face with [him]_p1988.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1989 was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing [him]_p1990 but [he]_p1991 began to rush to and fro while [she]_p1992 just stood there in amazement with [her]_p1993 hands crossed in front of [her]_p1994.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis, From then on [she]_p1995 never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on [him]_p1996.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," At first [she]_p1997 would call to [him]_p2000 as [she]_p1998 did so with words that [she]_p1998 probably considered friendly,such as""come on then,[you]_p2001 old dung-beetle !"", or""look at the old dung-beetle there !""[Gregor]_n266 never responded to being spoken to in that way,but just remained where [he]_p2002 was without moving as if the door had never even been opened.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," If only [they]_p2003 had told this charwoman to clean up [his]_p2004 room every day instead of letting [her]_p2005 disturb [him]_p2006 for no reason whenever [she]_p2008 felt like [it]_p2010! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, [she]_p2009 began to speak to [him]_p2007 in that way once again.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n267 was so resentful of [it]_p2011 that [he]_p2013 started to move toward [her]_p2015,[he]_p2014 was slow and infirm,but [it]_p2012 was like a kind of attack.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," Instead of being afraid,the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with [her]_p2016 mouth open,clearly intending not to close [her]_p2017 mouth until the chair in [her]_p2017 hand had been slammed down into [Gregor]_n268 's back.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Aren't [you]_p2019 coming any closer,then ?"", [she]_p2020 asked when [Gregor]_n269 turned round again,and [she]_p2021 calmly put the chair back in the corner.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n270 had almost entirely stopped eating.,1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," Only if [he]_p2022 happened to find [himself]_p2024 next to the food that had been prepared for [him]_p2025 [he]_p2023 might take some of [it]_p2026 into [his]_p2030 mouth to play with [it]_p2027, leave [it]_p2027 there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit [it]_p2028 out again.",0,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis," At first [he]_p2031 thought [it]_p2033 was distress at the state of [his]_p2034 room that stopped [him]_p2035 eating, but [he]_p2032 had soon got used to the changes made there.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p2036 had got into the habit of putting things into this room that [they]_p2037 had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," These earnest gentlemen - all three of [them]_p2038 had full beards,as [Gregor]_n271 learned peering through the crack in the door one day - were painfully insistent on things'being tidy.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," This meant not only in [their]_p2039 own room but, since [they]_p2040 had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Unnecessary clutter was something [they]_p2041 could not tolerate, especially if [it]_p2042 was dirty.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [They]_p2043 had moreover brought most of [their]_p2044 own furnishings and equipment with [them]_p2045.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although [they]_p2046 could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, All these things found [their]_p2047 way into [Gregor]_n272 's room.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, The dustbins from the kitchen found [their]_p2048 way in there too.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything [she]_p2049 couldn't use for the time being [she]_p2050 would just chuck in there.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2051, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held [it]_p2052.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when [she]_p2053 had time and the opportunity,or to throw everything out in one go,but what actually happened was that [they]_p2054 were left where [they]_p2055 landed when [they]_p2055 had first been thrown unless [Gregor]_n273 made [his]_p2057 way through the junk and moved [it]_p2058 somewhere else.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," At first [he]_p2059 moved [it]_p2064 because, with no other room free where [he]_p2060 could crawl about, [he]_p2060 was forced to, but later on [he]_p2061 came to enjoy [it]_p2065 although moving about in that way left [him]_p2066 sad and tired to death, and [he]_p2061 would remain immobile for hours afterwards.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take [their]_p2067 evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," But [Gregor]_n274 found [it]_p2068 easy to give up having the door open,[he]_p2072 had,after all,often failed to make use of [it]_p2069 when [it]_p2069 was open and,without the family having noticed [it]_p2070,lain in [his]_p2073 room in [its]_p2074 darkest corner.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and [it]_p2075 remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p2076 sat up at the table where,formerly,[Gregor]_n275 had taken [his]_p2077 meals with [his]_p2078 father and mother,[they]_p2079 unfolded the serviettes and picked up [their]_p2080 knives and forks.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n276 's mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind [her]_p2081 came [his]_p2082 sister with a dish piled high with potatoes.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," The food was steaming, and filled the room with [its]_p2083 smell.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of [them]_p2084 as if [they]_p2085 wanted to test the food before eating [it]_p2086, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while [it]_p2087 was still in [its]_p2090 dish, clearly wishing to establish whether [it]_p2087 was sufficiently cooked or whether [it]_p2088 should be sent back to the kitchen.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p2091 was to [his]_p2092 satisfaction,and [Gregor]_n277 's mother and sister,who had been looking on anxiously,began to breathe again and smiled.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, The family [themselves]_p2093 ate in the kitchen.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Nonetheless,[Gregor]_n278 's father came into the living room before [he]_p2094 went into the kitchen,bowed once with [his]_p2095 cap in [his]_p2096 hand and did [his]_p2096 round of the table.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into [their]_p2098 beards.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then, once [they]_p2099 were alone, [they]_p2100 ate in near perfect silence.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p2101 seemed remarkable to [Gregor]_n279 that above all the various noises of eating [their]_p2102 chewing teeth could still be heard,as if [they]_p2103 had wanted to show [Gregor]_n280 that [you]_p2105 need teeth in order to eat and [it]_p2106 was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice [they]_p2104 might be.",2,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""I'd like to eat something"", said [Gregor]_n281 anxiously ,""but not anything like they're eating.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis, [They]_p2107 do feed [themselves]_p2108.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," And here [I]_p2109 am,dying !""Throughout all this time,[Gregor]_n282 could not remember having heard the violin being played,but this evening [it]_p2110 began to be heard from the kitchen.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," The three gentlemen had already finished [their]_p2111 meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now [they]_p2113 leant back in [their]_p2112 chairs reading [them]_p2114 and smoking.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," When the violin began playing [they]_p2115 became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where [they]_p2116 stood pressed against each other.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Someone must have heard [them]_p2117 in the kitchen,as [Gregor]_n283 's father called out:""Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen?[We]_p2118 can stop [it]_p2119 straight away.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," """"On the contrary"", said the middle gentleman ,""would the young lady not like to come in and play for [us]_p2120 here in the room,where [it]_p2121 is,after all,much more cosy and comfortable ?""""Oh yes,we'd love to"", called back [Gregor]_n284 's father as if [he]_p2122 had been the violin player [himself]_p2123.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.,0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n285 's father soon appeared with the music stand,[his]_p2124 mother with the music and [his]_p2125 sister with the violin.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p2126 calmly prepared everything for [her]_p2127 to begin playing [his]_p2128 parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on [their]_p2133 own chairs [his]_p2129 father leant against the door with [his]_p2129 right hand pushed in between two buttons on [his]_p2130 uniform coat [his]_p2130 mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed [it]_p2134 - out of the way in a corner.",0,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p2135 sister began to play father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of [her]_p2136 hands.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Drawn in by the playing,[Gregor]_n286 had dared to come forward a little and already had [his]_p2137 head in the living room.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Before, [he]_p2138 had taken great pride in how considerate [he]_p2139 was but now [it]_p2141 hardly occurred to [him]_p2142 that [he]_p2139 had become so thoughtless about the others.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," What's more, there was now all the more reason to keep [himself]_p2143 hidden as [he]_p2145 was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in [his]_p2149 room and flew up at the slightest movement [he]_p2146 carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on [his]_p2150 back and sides [he]_p2146 was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on [his]_p2150 back and wipe [himself]_p2144 on the carpet like [he]_p2147 had used to do several times a day.",0,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis," And despite this condition, [he]_p2152 was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," No-one noticed [him]_p2153, though.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing at first,the three gentlemen had put [their]_p2154 hands in [their]_p2155 pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played,and [they]_p2157 must have disturbed [Gregor]_n287 's sister,but soon,in contrast with the family,[they]_p2158 withdrew back to the window with [their]_p2155 heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume,and [they]_p2158 stayed by the window while [Gregor]_n288 's father observed [them]_p2160 anxiously.",2,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p2161 really now seemed very obvious that [they]_p2162 had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that [they]_p2163 had had enough of the whole performance and [it]_p2165 was only now out of politeness that [they]_p2163 allowed [their]_p2166 peace to be disturbed.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p2167 was especially unnerving, the way [they]_p2168 all blew the smoke from [their]_p2169 cigarettes upwards from [their]_p2170 mouth and noses.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, Yet [Gregor]_n289 's sister was playing so beautifully.,1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Her]_p2171 face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n290 crawled a little further forward,keeping [his]_p2172 head close to the ground so that [he]_p2173 could meet [her]_p2174 eyes if the chance came.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, Was [he]_p2175 an animal if music could captivate [him]_p2178 so? [It]_p2180 seemed to [him]_p2179 that [he]_p2176 was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment [he]_p2176 had been yearning for.,0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2181 was determined to make [his]_p2182 way forward to [his]_p2183 sister and tug at [her]_p2185 skirt to show [her]_p2186 [she]_p2189 might come into [his]_p2183 room with [her]_p2186 violin, as no-one appreciated [her]_p2187 playing here as much as [he]_p2190 would.",0,,10,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2191 never wanted to let [her]_p2192 out of [his]_p2197 room,not while [he]_p2201 lived,anyway [his]_p2198 shocking appearance should,for once,be of some use to [him]_p2206 [he]_p2202 wanted to be at every door of [his]_p2198 room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers [his]_p2199 sister should not be forced to stay with [him]_p2207,though,but stay of [her]_p2193 own free will [she]_p2211 would sit beside [him]_p2207 on the couch with [her]_p2193 ear bent down to [him]_p2208 while [he]_p2202 told [her]_p2194 how [he]_p2203 had always intended to send [her]_p2194 to the conservatory,how [he]_p2203 would have told everyone about [it]_p2212 last [Christmas]_n291 - had [Christmas]_n292 really come and gone already?- if this misfortune hadn't got in the way,and refuse to let anyone dissuade [him]_p2208 from [it]_p2213.",2,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," On hearing all this,[his]_p2214 sister would break out in tears of emotion,and [Gregor]_n293 would climb up to [her]_p2215 shoulder and kiss [her]_p2216 neck,which,since [she]_p2217 had been going out to work,[she]_p2218 had kept free without any necklace or collar.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Mr Samsa]_n294 !"", shouted the middle gentleman to [Gregor]_n295 's father,pointing,without wasting any more words,with [his]_p2219 forefinger at [Gregor]_n296 as [he]_p2220 slowly moved forward.",3,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," The violin went silent,the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at [his]_p2221 two friends,shaking [his]_p2222 head,and then looked back at [Gregor]_n297.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p2223 father seemed to think [it]_p2224 more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving [Gregor]_n298 out,even though [they]_p2225 were not at all upset and seemed to think [Gregor]_n299 was more entertaining than the violin playing had been.",2,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p2226 rushed up to [them]_p2227 with [his]_p2229 arms spread out and attempted to drive [them]_p2228 back into [their]_p2231 room at the same time as trying to block [their]_p2232 view of [Gregor]_n300 with [his]_p2230 body.,1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," Now [they]_p2233 did become a little annoyed,and [it]_p2235 was not clear whether [it]_p2236 was [his]_p2238 father's behaviour that annoyed [them]_p2239 or the dawning realisation that [they]_p2234 had had a neighbour like [Gregor]_n301 in the next room without knowing [it]_p2236.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p2240 asked [Gregor]_n302 's father for explanations,raised [their]_p2241 arms like [he]_p2244 had,tugged excitedly at [their]_p2242 beards and moved back towards [their]_p2242 room only very slowly.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, Meanwhile [Gregor]_n303 's sister had overcome the despair [she]_p2245 had fallen into when [her]_p2246 playing was suddenly interrupted.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p2247 had let [her]_p2248 hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then [she]_p2251 suddenly pulled [herself]_p2253 together, lay the instrument on [her]_p2249 mother's lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where [she]_p2252 was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from [her]_p2249 father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," Under [his]_p2254 sister's experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and [she]_p2255 had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n304 's father seemed so obsessed with what [he]_p2256 was doing that [he]_p2257 forgot all the respect [he]_p2257 owed to [his]_p2259 tenants.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2260 urged [them]_p2261 and pressed [them]_p2262 until,when [he]_p2263 was already at the door of the room,the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped [his]_p2264 foot and thereby brought [Gregor]_n305 's father to a halt.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[I]_p2265 declare here and now"", [he]_p2267 said,raising [his]_p2269 hand and glancing at [Gregor]_n306 's mother and sister to gain [their]_p2270 attention too ,""that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family""- here [he]_p2268 looked briefly but decisively at the floor -""[I]_p2266 give immediate notice on [my]_p2271 room.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," For the days that [I]_p2272 have been living here [I]_p2273 will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary [I]_p2273 will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from [you]_p2275, and believe [me]_p2276 [it]_p2277 would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" [He]_p2278 was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," And indeed, [his]_p2279 two friends joined in with the words: ""And [we]_p2280 also give immediate notice.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" With that, [he]_p2281 took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n307 's father staggered back to [his]_p2282 seat,feeling [his]_p2283 way with [his]_p2283 hands,and fell into [it]_p2287 [it]_p2288 looked as if [he]_p2290 was stretching [himself]_p2292 out for [his]_p2284 usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way [his]_p2284 head kept nodding [it]_p2288 could be seen that [he]_p2291 was not sleeping at all.",1,,11,
kafka_metamorphosis," Throughout all this,[Gregor]_n308 had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen [him]_p2293.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p2294 disappointment at the failure of [his]_p2295 plan, and perhaps also because [he]_p2296 was weak from hunger, made [it]_p2297 impossible for [him]_p2298 to move.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2299 was sure that everyone would turn on [him]_p2300 any moment, and [he]_p2301 waited.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p2302 was not even startled out of this state when the violin on [his]_p2303 mother's lap fell from [her]_p2304 trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Father]_n309,[Mother]_n310"", said [his]_p2305 sister,hitting the table with [her]_p2306 hand as introduction ,""[we]_p2307 can't carry on like this.",2,,3,

kafka_metamorphosis," """"She's absolutely right"", said [Gregor]_n311 's father to [himself]_p2319.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p2320 mother, who still had not had time to catch [her]_p2321 breath, began to cough dully, [her]_p2322 hand held out in front of [her]_p2322 and a deranged expression in [her]_p2323 eyes.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Gregor]_n312 's sister rushed to [his]_p2325 mother and put [her]_p2326 hand on [her]_p2327 forehead.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Her]_p2328 words seemed to give [Gregor]_n313 's father some more definite ideas.,1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2329 sat upright,played with [his]_p2330 uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after [their]_p2331 meal,and occasionally looked down at [Gregor]_n314 as [he]_p2332 lay there immobile.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[We]_p2333 have to try and get rid of [it]_p2334"", said [Gregor]_n315 's sister,now speaking only to [her]_p2337 father,as [her]_p2338 mother was too occupied with coughing to listen ,""it'll be the death of both of [you]_p2339,[I]_p2340 can see [it]_p2335 coming.",1,,7,

kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p2476 is true that [his]_p2477 entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2478 could already hardly feel the decayed apple in [his]_p2479 back or the inflamed area around [it]_p2480, which was entirely covered in white dust.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p2481 thought back of [his]_p2482 family with emotion and love.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," If [it]_p2483 was possible, [he]_p2484 felt that [he]_p2485 must go away even more strongly than [his]_p2486 sister.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p2487 remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until [he]_p2488 heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p2489 watched as [it]_p2490 slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then, without [his]_p2491 willing [it]_p2495, [his]_p2492 head sank down completely, and [his]_p2492 last breath flowed weakly from [his]_p2493 nostrils.",0,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked [her]_p2496 not to keep slamming the doors but with [her]_p2497 strength and in [her]_p2497 hurry [she]_p2500 still did,so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd arrived and from then on [it]_p2503 was impossible to sleep in peace - [she]_p2501 made [her]_p2498 usual brief look in on [Gregor]_n330 and at first found nothing special.",1,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p2504 thought [he]_p2505 was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr [she]_p2506 attributed all possible understanding to [him]_p2507.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p2508 happened to be holding the long broom in [her]_p2509 hand,so [she]_p2510 tried to tickle [Gregor]_n331 with [it]_p2511 from the doorway.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," When [she]_p2512 had no success with that [she]_p2513 tried to make a nuisance of [herself]_p2517 and poked at [him]_p2518 a little, and only when [she]_p2513 found [she]_p2514 could shove [him]_p2519 across the floor with no resistance at all did [she]_p2514 start to pay attention.",0,,8,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p2520 soon realised what had really happened,opened [her]_p2521 eyes wide,whistled to [herself]_p2522,but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms:""Come and 'ave a look at this,it's dead,just lying there,stone dead !""Mr and [Mrs Samsa]_n332 sat upright there in [their]_p2523 marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before [they]_p2524 could grasp what [she]_p2525 was saying.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," But then, each from [his]_p2526 own side, [they]_p2527 hurried out of bed.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Mr Samsa]_n333 threw the blanket over [his]_p2528 shoulders,[Mrs Samsa]_n334 just came out in [her]_p2529 nightdress and that is how [they]_p2530 went into [Gregor]_n335 's room.",3,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," On the way [they]_p2531 opened the door to the living room where [Grete]_n336 had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in [she]_p2532 was fully dressed as if [she]_p2533 had never been asleep,and the paleness of [her]_p2534 face seemed to confirm this.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Dead]_n337 ?"", asked [Mrs Samsa]_n338,looking at the charwoman enquiringly,even though [she]_p2535 could have checked for [herself]_p2536 and could have known [it]_p2537 even without checking.",2,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""That's what [I]_p2538 said"", replied the cleaner,and to prove [it]_p2539 [she]_p2541 gave [Gregor]_n339 's body another shove with the broom,sending [it]_p2540 sideways across the floor.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Mrs Samsa]_n340 made a movement as if [she]_p2542 wanted to hold back the broom,but did not complete [it]_p2543.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Now then"", said [Mr Samsa]_n341 ,""let's give thanks to God for that"".",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2544 crossed [himself]_p2545, and the three women followed [his]_p2546 example.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Grete]_n342,who had not taken [her]_p2547 eyes from the corpse,said:""Just look how thin [he]_p2548 was.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [He]_p2549 didn't eat anything for so long.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," The food came out again just the same as when [it]_p2550 went in"".",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n343 's body was indeed completely dried up and flat,[they]_p2551 had not seen [it]_p2552 until then,but now [he]_p2553 was not lifted up on [his]_p2555 little legs,nor did [he]_p2554 do anything to make [them]_p2556 look away.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Grete]_n344,come with [us]_p2557 in here for a little while"", said [Mrs Samsa]_n345 with a pained smile,and [Grete]_n346 followed [her]_p2558 parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body.",3,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide.,0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis, Although [it]_p2559 was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with [it]_p2560.,0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p2561 was already the end of [March]_n347,after all.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, The three gentlemen stepped out of [their]_p2562 room and looked round in amazement for [their]_p2563 breakfasts [they]_p2564 had been forgotten about.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Where is [our]_p2565 breakfast?"", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, [She]_p2566 just put [her]_p2567 finger on [her]_p2568 lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that [they]_p2569 might like to come into [Gregor]_n348 's room.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p2570 did so,and stood around [Gregor]_n349 's corpse with [their]_p2571 hands in the pockets of [their]_p2572 well-worn coats.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [It]_p2573 was now quite light in the room.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, Then the door of the bedroom opened and [Mr Samsa]_n350 appeared in [his]_p2574 uniform with [his]_p2575 wife on one arm and [his]_p2575 daughter on the other.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, All of [them]_p2577 had been crying a little [Grete]_n351 now and then pressed [her]_p2578 face against [her]_p2579 father's arm.,1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Leave [my]_p2580 home.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Now !"", said [Mr Samsa]_n352,indicating the door and without letting the women from [him]_p2581.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""What do [you]_p2582 mean?"", asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and [he]_p2583 smiled sweetly.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, The other two held [their]_p2584 hands behind [their]_p2585 backs and continually rubbed [them]_p2587 together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in [their]_p2585 favour.,0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[I]_p2588 mean just what [I]_p2589 said"", answered [Mr Samsa]_n353,and,with [his]_p2590 two companions,went in a straight line towards the man.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," At first, [he]_p2591 stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of [his]_p2592 head were rearranging [themselves]_p2593 into new positions.",0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Alright]_n354,we'll go then"", [he]_p2594 said,and looked up at [Mr Samsa]_n355 as if [he]_p2595 had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from [Mr Samsa]_n356 for [his]_p2596 decision.",3,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Mr Samsa]_n357 merely opened [his]_p2597 eyes wide and briefly nodded to [him]_p2598 several times.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway [his]_p2599 two friends had stopped rubbing [their]_p2600 hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, Now [they]_p2601 jumped off after [their]_p2602 friend as if taken with a sudden fear that [Mr Samsa]_n358 might go into the hallway in front of [them]_p2604 and break the connection with [their]_p2603 leader.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," Once there, all three took [their]_p2605 hats from the stand, took [their]_p2606 sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the premises.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Mr Samsa]_n359 and the two women followed [them]_p2607 out onto the landing but [they]_p2608 had had no reason to mistrust the men's intentions and as [they]_p2609 leaned over the landing [they]_p2609 saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps.,1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," As [they]_p2611 turned the corner on each floor [they]_p2612 disappeared and would reappear a few moments later the further down [they]_p2612 went,the more that the [Samsa]_n360 family lost interest in [them]_p2615 when a butcher's boy,proud of posture with [his]_p2617 tray on [his]_p2618 head,passed [them]_p2616 on [his]_p2618 way up and came nearer than [they]_p2613 were,[Mr Samsa]_n361 and the women came away from the landing and went,as if relieved,back into the flat.",2,,9,
kafka_metamorphosis, [They]_p2620 decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk not only had [they]_p2621 earned a break from work but [they]_p2622 were in serious need of [it]_p2623.,0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," So [they]_p2624 sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal,[Mr Samsa]_n362 to [his]_p2625 employers,[Mrs Samsa]_n363 to [her]_p2626 contractor and [Grete]_n364 to [her]_p2627 principal.",3,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," The cleaner came in while [they]_p2628 were writing to tell [them]_p2629 [she]_p2630 was going, she'd finished [her]_p2632 work for that morning.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," The three of [them]_p2633 at first just nodded without looking up from what [they]_p2634 were writing, and [it]_p2636 was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that [they]_p2635 looked up in irritation.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Well ?"", asked [Mr Samsa]_n365.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on [her]_p2637 face as if [she]_p2638 had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do [it]_p2640 if [she]_p2639 was clearly asked to.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," The almost vertical little ostrich feather on [her]_p2641 hat,which had been a source of irritation to [Mr Samsa]_n366 all the time [she]_p2642 had been working for [them]_p2643,swayed gently in all directions.",1,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""What is [it]_p2644 [you]_p2645 want then ?"", asked [Mrs Samsa]_n367,whom the cleaner had the most respect for.",1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Yes"", [she]_p2646 answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made [her]_p2647 unable to speak straight away, ""well then, that thing in there, [you]_p2648 needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of [it]_p2650.",0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, That's all been sorted out.,0,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Mrs Samsa]_n368 and [Grete]_n369 bent down over [their]_p2651 letters as if intent on continuing with what [they]_p2652 were writing [Mr Samsa]_n370 saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but,with outstretched hand,[he]_p2653 made [it]_p2654 quite clear that [she]_p2655 was not to.",3,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis," So,as [she]_p2656 was prevented from telling [them]_p2660 all about [it]_p2661,[she]_p2657 suddenly remembered what a hurry [she]_p2657 was in and,clearly peeved,called out""[Cheerio]_n371 then,everyone"", turned round sharply and left,slamming the door terribly as [she]_p2658 went.",1,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Tonight [she]_p2662 gets sacked"", said [Mr Samsa]_n372,but [he]_p2663 received no reply from either [his]_p2664 wife or [his]_p2665 daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace [they]_p2666 had only just gained.",1,,5,
kafka_metamorphosis, [They]_p2667 got up and went over to the window where [they]_p2668 remained with [their]_p2669 arms around each other.,0,,3,
kafka_metamorphosis, [Mr Samsa]_n373 twisted round in [his]_p2670 chair to look at [them]_p2671 and sat there watching for a while.,1,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then [he]_p2672 called out: ""Come here, then.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall [we]_p2673.",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," Come and give [me]_p2674 a bit of attention"".",0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," The two women immediately did as [he]_p2675 said, hurrying over to [him]_p2676 where [they]_p2679 kissed [him]_p2677 and hugged [him]_p2677 and then [they]_p2680 quickly finished [their]_p2681 letters.",0,,7,
kafka_metamorphosis," After that, the three of [them]_p2682 left the flat together, which was something [they]_p2683 had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p2684 had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to [themselves]_p2685.",0,,2,
kafka_metamorphosis," Leant back comfortably on [their]_p2686 seats, [they]_p2689 discussed [their]_p2687 prospects and found that on closer examination [they]_p2690 were not at all bad - until then [they]_p2690 had never asked each other about [their]_p2687 work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future.",0,,6,
kafka_metamorphosis," The greatest improvement for the time being,of course,would be achieved quite easily by moving house what [they]_p2692 needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by [Gregor]_n374,one that was in a better location and,most of all,more practical.",1,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis," All the time,[Grete]_n375 was becoming livelier.",1,,0,
kafka_metamorphosis," With all the worry [they]_p2693 had been having of late [her]_p2695 cheeks had become pale,but,while [they]_p2694 were talking,Mr and [Mrs Samsa]_n376 were struck,almost simultaneously,with the thought of how [their]_p2696 daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.",1,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis, [They]_p2697 became quieter.,0,,1,
kafka_metamorphosis, Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing [it]_p2698 [they]_p2700 agreed that [it]_p2699 would soon be time to find a good man for [her]_p2701.,0,,4,
kafka_metamorphosis," And,as if in confirmation of [their]_p2702 new dreams and good intentions,as soon as [they]_p2704 reached [their]_p2703 destination [Grete]_n377 was the first to get up and stretch out [her]_p2705 young body.",1,,4,
