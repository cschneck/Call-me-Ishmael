kafka_metamorphosis,"[I]_p0 One morning, when [Gregor Samsa]_n0 woke from troubled dreams, [he]_p1 found [himself]_p2 transformed in [his]_p3 bed into a horrible vermin. [He]_p4 lay on [his]_p5 armour-like back, and if [he]_p8 lifted [his]_p6 head a little [he]_p9 could see [his]_p6 brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover [it]_p10 and seemed ready to slide off any moment. [His]_p11 many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as [he]_p12 looked. ""What's happened to me?"" [he]_p13 thought. [It]_p14 wasn't a dream. [His]_p15 room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between [its]_p16 four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - [Samsa]_n1 was a travelling salesman - and above [it]_p17 there hung a picture that [he]_p18 had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. [It]_p19 showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of [her]_p20 lower arm towards the viewer. [Gregor]_n2 then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.",3,,21,
kafka_metamorphosis," Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made [him]_p21 feel quite sad. ""How about if [I]_p22 sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense"", [he]_p23 thought, but that was something [he]_p24 was unable to do because [he]_p24 was used to sleeping on [his]_p26 right, and in [his]_p27 present state couldn't get into that position. However hard [he]_p28 threw [himself]_p31 onto [his]_p32 right, [he]_p29 always rolled back to where [he]_p29 was. [He]_p33 must have tried [it]_p34 a hundred times, shut [his]_p35 eyes so that [he]_p36 wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when [he]_p37 began to feel a mild, dull pain there that [he]_p37 had never felt before. ""Oh, God"", [he]_p39 thought, ""what a strenuous career [it]_p40 is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing [your]_p41 own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that [you]_p42 can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. [It]_p43 can all go to [Hell]_n3 !"" [He]_p44 felt a slight itch up on [his]_p45 belly pushed [himself]_p49 slowly up on [his]_p46 back towards the headboard so that [he]_p50 could lift [his]_p46 head better found where the itch was, and saw that [it]_p56 was covered with lots of little white spots which [he]_p51 didn't know what to make of and when [he]_p51 tried to feel the place with one of [his]_p47 legs [he]_p52 drew [it]_p57 quickly back because as soon as [he]_p52 touched [it]_p57 [he]_p52 was overcome by a cold shudder. [He]_p59 slid back into [his]_p60 former position. ""Getting up early all the time"", [he]_p61 thought, ""it makes [you]_p62 stupid. You've got to get enough sleep.",1,,42,
kafka_metamorphosis," Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever [I]_p63 go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating [their]_p64 breakfasts. [I]_p65 ought to just try that with [my]_p67 boss I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If [I]_p68 didn't have [my]_p74 parents to think about I'd have given in [my]_p75 notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told [him]_p76 just what [I]_p69 think, tell [him]_p77 everything [I]_p69 would, let [him]_p77 know just what [I]_p70 feel. He'd fall right off [his]_p79 desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at [your]_p80 desk, talking down at [your]_p81 subordinates from up there, especially when [you]_p82 have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope once I've got the money together to pay off [my]_p86 parents' debt to [him]_p87 - another five or six years [I]_p83 suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, [my]_p88 train leaves at five. ""  And [he]_p89 looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.",0,,22,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""God in [Heaven]_n4 !"" [he]_p90 thought. [It]_p91 was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, [it]_p92 was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? [He]_p93 could see from the bed that [it]_p94 had been set for four o'clock as [it]_p95 should have been [it]_p95 certainly must have rung. Yes, but was [it]_p97 possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, [he]_p98 had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should [he]_p99 do now? The next train went at seven if [he]_p100 were to catch that [he]_p100 would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and [he]_p101 did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if [he]_p103 did catch the train [he]_p104 would not avoid [his]_p106 boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, [he]_p104 would have put in [his]_p107 report about [Gregor]_n5 's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if [he]_p108 reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service [Gregor]_n6 had never once yet been ill. [His]_p109 boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse [his]_p110 parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would [he]_p111 have been entirely wrong in this case? [Gregor]_n7 did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.",4,,22,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p112 was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock at the door near [his]_p113 head. ""[Gregor]_n8 "", somebody called - [it]_p114 was [his]_p116 mother - ""it's quarter to seven. Didn't [you]_p117 want to go somewhere?"" That gentle voice! [Gregor]_n9 was shocked when [he]_p118 heard [his]_p120 own voice answering, [it]_p121 could hardly be recognised as the voice [he]_p119 had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made [them]_p122 unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether [he]_p123 had heard properly or not. [Gregor]_n10 had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented [himself]_p124 with saying: ""Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting up now. "" The change in [Gregor]_n11 's voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as [his]_p125 mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that [Gregor]_n12 , against [their]_p126 expectations was still at home, and soon [his]_p127 father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with [his]_p128 fist. ""[Gregor]_n13 , [Gregor]_n14 "", [he]_p129 called, ""what's wrong?"" And after a short while [he]_p130 called again with a warning deepness in [his]_p131 voi[ce: ""G][_n reg]_n15 or! Gregor!"" At the other side door [his]_p132 sister came[ plain]_n16 tively: ""Gregor? Aren't [you]_p134 well? Do [you]_p[135 ne]_n17 ed anything?"" Gregor answered to both sides: ""I'm ready, now"", making an effort to remove all the strangeness from [his]_p132 voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. [His]_p136 father went back to [his]_p137 breakfast, but [his]_p138 sister whispered: ""[Gregor]_n18 , open the door, [I]_p139 beg of you.",11,,27,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" [Gregor]_n19 , however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated [himself]_p140 for [his]_p141 cautious habit, acquired from [his]_p142 travelling, of locking all doors at night even when [he]_p143 was at home. The first thing [he]_p144 wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have [his]_p145 breakfast. Only then would [he]_p146 consider what to do next, as [he]_p147 was well aware that [he]_p147 would not bring [his]_p149 thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. [He]_p150 remembered that [he]_p151 had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and [he]_p152 wondered how [his]_p153 imaginings would slowly resolve [themselves]_p154 today. [He]_p155 did not have the slightest doubt that the change in [his]_p156 voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen. [It]_p157 was a simple matter to throw off the covers [he]_p158 only had to blow [himself]_p159 up a little and [they]_p160 fell off by themselves. But [it]_p161 became difficult after that, especially as [he]_p162 was so exceptionally broad. [He]_p163 would have used [his]_p164 arms and [his]_p165 hands to push [himself]_p166 up but instead of [them]_p167 [he]_p168 only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which [he]_p169 was moreover unable to control. If [he]_p170 wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch [itself]_p173 out and if [he]_p171 finally managed to do what [he]_p171 wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. ""This is something that can't be done in bed"", [Gregor]_n20 said to himself, ""so don't keep trying to do it"".",2,,34,
kafka_metamorphosis," The first thing [he]_p174 wanted to do was get the lower part of [his]_p180 body out of the bed, but [he]_p175 had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what [it]_p182 looked like [it]_p183 turned out to be too hard to move  [it]_p183 went so slowly and finally, almost in a frenzy, when [he]_p175 carelessly shoved [himself]_p185 forwards with all the force [he]_p176 could gather, [he]_p176 chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain [he]_p176 felt that the lower part of [his]_p181 body might well, at present, be the most sensitive. So then [he]_p186 tried to get the top part of [his]_p187 body out of the bed first, carefully turning [his]_p188 head to the side. This [he]_p189 managed quite easily, and despite [its]_p190 breadth and [its]_p191 weight, the bulk of [his]_p192 body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when [he]_p193 had at last got [his]_p196 head out of the bed and into the fresh air [it]_p198 occurred to [him]_p200 that if [he]_p194 let [himself]_p201 fall [it]_p199 would be a miracle if [his]_p197 head were not injured, so [he]_p194 became afraid to carry on pushing [himself]_p202 forward the same way. And [he]_p203 could not knock [himself]_p204 out now at any price better to stay in bed than lose consciousness. [It]_p205 took just as much effort to get back to where [he]_p206 had been earlier, but when [he]_p207 lay there sighing, and was once more watching [his]_p209 legs as [they]_p210 struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, [he]_p207 could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. [He]_p211 told [himself]_p212 once more that [it]_p213 was not possible for [him]_p215 to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of [it]_p214 in whatever way [he]_p216 could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time, though, [he]_p217 did not forget to remind [himself]_p218 that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this [he]_p219 would direct [his]_p221 eyes to the window and look out as clearly as [he]_p220 could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. ""Seven o'clock, already"", [he]_p222 said to [himself]_p223 when the clock struck again, ""seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like this.",0,,50,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" And [he]_p224 lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if [he]_p225 perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to [their]_p226 real and natural state. But then [he]_p227 said to himself: ""Before [it]_p228 strikes quarter past seven I'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to [me]_p229 as well, as [they]_p230 open up at work before seven o'clock. "" And so [he]_p231 set [himself]_p232 to the task of swinging the entire length of [his]_p233 body out of the bed all at the same time. If [he]_p234 succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept [his]_p237 head raised as [he]_p235 did so [he]_p235 could probably avoid injuring it. [His]_p238 back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to [it]_p239 falling onto the carpet. [His]_p240 main concern was for the loud noise [he]_p241 was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But [it]_p242 was something that had to be risked. When [Gregor]_n21 was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort, all [he]_p243 had to do was rock back and forth - [it]_p244 occurred to [him]_p245 how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him. Two strong people - [he]_p247 had [his]_p249 father and the maid in mind - would have been more than enough [they]_p251 would only have to push [their]_p252 arms under the dome of [his]_p250 back, peel [him]_p253 away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as [he]_p248 swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.",1,,29,
kafka_metamorphosis," Should [he]_p254 really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty [he]_p255 was in, [he]_p255 could not suppress a smile at this thought. After a while [he]_p257 had already moved so far across that [it]_p259 would have been hard for [him]_p260 to keep [his]_p261 balance if [he]_p258 rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and [he]_p262 would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. ""That'll be someone from work"", [he]_p263 said to himself, and froze very still, although [his]_p264 little legs only became all the more lively as [they]_p265 danced around. For a moment everything remained quiet. ""They're not opening the door"", [Gregor]_n22 said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. [Gregor]_n23 only needed to hear the visitor's first words of greeting and [he]_p266 knew who [it]_p267 was - the chief clerk himself. Why did [Gregor]_n24 have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where [they]_p268 immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of [them]_p270 who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that [he]_p272 couldn't get out of bed if [he]_p273 didn't spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was [it]_p275 really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were even necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did [they]_p269 have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made [him]_p279 upset than through any proper decision, [he]_p273 swang [himself]_p277 with all [his]_p280 force out of the bed.",3,,24,
kafka_metamorphosis," There was a loud thump, but [it]_p281 wasn't really a loud noise. [His]_p282 fall was softened a little by the carpet, and [Gregor]_n25 's back was also more elastic than [he]_p283 had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable. [He]_p284 had not held [his]_p285 head carefully enough, though, and hit [it]_p286 as [he]_p289 fell annoyed and in pain, [he]_p290 turned [it]_p287 and rubbed [it]_p287 against the carpet. ""[Something]_n26 's fallen down in there"", said the chief clerk in the room on the left. [Gregor]_n27 tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to [him]_p291 today could ever happen to the chief clerk too [you]_p292 had to concede that [it]_p293 was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in [his]_p294 highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on [his]_p295 right, [Gregor]_n28 's sister whispered to [him]_p296 to let [him]_p297 know: ""[Gregor]_n29 , the chief clerk is here. "" ""Yes, [I]_p298 know"", said [Gregor]_n30 to [himself]_p299 but without daring to raise [his]_p300 voice loud enough for [his]_p301 sister to hear him. ""[Gregor]_n31 "", said [his]_p302 father now from the room to [his]_p303 left, ""the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why [you]_p304 didn't leave on the early train. [We]_p305 don't know what to say to him.",7,,25,
kafka_metamorphosis," And anyway, [he]_p306 wants to speak to [you]_p307 personally. So please open up this door. I'm sure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of [your]_p308 room. "" Then the chief clerk called ""Good morning, [Mr Samsa]_n32 "". ""He isn't well"", said [his]_p309 mother to the chief clerk, while [his]_p310 father continued to speak through the door. ""He isn't well, please believe me. Why else would [Gregor]_n33 have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. [It]_p311 nearly makes [me]_p312 cross the way [he]_p313 never goes out in the evenings he's been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening. [He]_p315 sits with [us]_p316 in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. [His]_p317 idea of relaxation is working with [his]_p318 fretsaw.",2,,12,
kafka_metamorphosis," He's made a little frame, for instance, [it]_p319 only took [him]_p323 two or three evenings, you'll be amazed how nice [it]_p320 is it's hanging up in [his]_p324 room you'll see [it]_p320 as soon as [Gregor]_n34 opens the door. Anyway, I'm glad you're here [we]_p325 wouldn't have been able to get [Gregor]_n35 to open the door by [ourselves]_p326 he's so stubborn and I'm sure [he]_p327 isn't well, [he]_p328 said this morning that [he]_p328 is, but [he]_p329 isn't. "" ""I'll be there in a moment"", said [Gregor]_n36 slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that [he]_p332 would not miss any word of the conversation. ""Well [I]_p333 can't think of any other way of explaining it, [Mrs Samsa]_n37 "", said the chief clerk, ""I hope it's nothing serious. But on the other hand, [I]_p335 must say that if [we]_p336 people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as [you]_p338 like, [we]_p337 simply have to overcome [it]_p339 because of business considerations. "" ""Can the chief clerk come in to see [you]_p340 now then?"", asked [his]_p341 father impatiently, knocking at the door again. ""No"", said [Gregor]_n38. In the room on [his]_p342 right there followed a painful silence in the room on [his]_p343 left [his]_p343 sister began to cry. So why did [his]_p345 sister not go and join the others? [She]_p346 had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was [she]_p347 crying? Was [it]_p348 because [he]_p349 had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because [he]_p350 was in danger of losing [his]_p351 job and if that happened [his]_p352 boss would once more pursue [their]_p353 parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that yet.",5,,32,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n39 was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning [his]_p354 family. For the time being [he]_p355 just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition [he]_p356 was in would seriously have expected [him]_p357 to let the chief clerk in. [It]_p358 was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for [it]_p359 later on, [it]_p360 was not something for which [Gregor]_n40 could be sacked on the spot. And [it]_p361 seemed to [Gregor]_n41 much more sensible to leave [him]_p362 now in peace instead of disturbing [him]_p363 with talking at [him]_p363 and crying. But the others didn't know what was happening, [they]_p365 were worried, that would excuse [their]_p366 behaviour. The chief clerk now raised [his]_p367 voice, ""[Mr Samsa]_n42 "", [he]_p368 called to him, ""what is wrong? [You]_p369 barricade [yourself]_p370 in [your]_p371 room, give [us]_p374 no more than yes or no for an answer, [you]_p375 are causing serious and unnecessary concern to [your]_p372 parents and [you]_p376 fail - and [I]_p378 mention this just by the way - [you]_p376 fail to carry out [your]_p372 business duties in a way that is quite unheard of. I'm speaking here on behalf of [your]_p379 parents and of [your]_p380 employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. [I]_p381 am astonished, quite astonished. [I]_p382 thought [I]_p383 knew [you]_p384 as a calm and sensible person, and now [you]_p385 suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. This morning, [your]_p386 employer did suggest a possible reason for [your]_p387 failure to appear, it's true - [it]_p388 had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to [you]_p390 - but [I]_p391 came near to giving [him]_p392 [my]_p393 word of honour that that could not be the right explanation.",4,,39,
kafka_metamorphosis," But now that [I]_p394 see [your]_p396 incomprehensible stubbornness [I]_p395 no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on [your]_p397 behalf. And nor is [your]_p398 position all that secure. [I]_p399 had originally intended to say all this to [you]_p401 in private, but since [you]_p402 cause [me]_p403 to waste [my]_p404 time here for no good reason [I]_p400 don't see why [your]_p405 parents should not also learn of it. [Your]_p406 turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late [I]_p407 grant [you]_p408 that it's not the time of year to do especially good business, [we]_p409 recognise that but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, [Mr Samsa]_n43 , [we]_p410 cannot allow there to be. "" ""But Sir"", called [Gregor]_n44 , beside [himself]_p411 and forgetting all else in the excitement, ""I'll open up immediately, just a moment. I'm slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, [I]_p412 haven't been able to get up. I'm still in bed now. I'm quite fresh again now, though. I'm just getting out of bed. Just a moment.",2,,19,
kafka_metamorphosis," Be patient! It's not quite as easy as I'd thought. I'm quite alright now, though. It's shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! [I]_p414 was quite alright last night, [my]_p416 parents know about it, perhaps better than me, [I]_p415 had a small symptom of [it]_p417 last night already. [They]_p419 must have noticed it. [I]_p420 don't know why [I]_p421 didn't let [you]_p422 know at work! But [you]_p423 always think [you]_p423 can get over an illness without staying at home. Please, don't make [my]_p425 parents suffer! There's no basis for any of the accusations you're making nobody's ever said a word to [me]_p426 about any of these things. Maybe [you]_p427 haven't read the latest contracts [I]_p428 sent in. I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given [me]_p429 strength. [You]_p430 don't need to wait, sir I'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend [me]_p431 to him!"" And while [Gregor]_n45 gushed out these words, hardly knowing what [he]_p432 was saying, [he]_p433 made [his]_p436 way over to the chest of drawers - this was easily done, probably because of the practise [he]_p433 had already had in bed - where [he]_p434 now tried to get [himself]_p437 upright. [He]_p438 really did want to open the door, really did want to let [them]_p439 see [him]_p440 and to speak with the chief clerk the others were being so insistent, and [he]_p442 was curious to learn what [they]_p443 would say when [they]_p444 caught sight of him.",1,,29,
kafka_metamorphosis," If [they]_p445 were shocked then [it]_p446 would no longer be [Gregor]_n46 's responsibility and [he]_p447 could rest. If, however, [they]_p448 took everything calmly [he]_p449 would still have no reason to be upset, and if [he]_p450 hurried [he]_p450 really could be at the station for eight o'clock. The first few times [he]_p452 tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers [he]_p453 just slid down again, but [he]_p453 finally gave [himself]_p456 one last swing and stood there upright the lower part of [his]_p457 body was in serious pain but [he]_p454 no longer gave any attention to it. Now [he]_p458 let [himself]_p459 fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of [it]_p460 with [his]_p461 little legs. By now [he]_p462 had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that [he]_p463 could listen to what the chief clerk was saying. ""Did [you]_p464 understand a word of all that?"" the chief clerk asked [his]_p465 parents, ""surely he's not trying to make fools of us"". ""Oh, God!"" called [his]_p466 mother, who was already in tears, ""he could be seriously ill and we're making [him]_p467 suffer. [Grete]_n47 ! [Grete]_n48 !"" [she]_p468 then cried. ""[Mother]_n49 ?"" [his]_p469 sister called from the other side. [They]_p470 communicated across [Gregor]_n50 's room.",5,,26,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""You'll have to go for the doctor straight away. [Gregor]_n51 is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did [you]_p471 hear the way [Gregor]_n52 spoke just now?"" ""That was the voice of an animal"", said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with [his]_p472 mother's screams. ""[Anna]_n53 ! [Anna]_n54 !"" [his]_p473 father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping [his]_p474 hands, ""get a locksmith here, now!"" And the two girls, [their]_p475 skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as [they]_p476 went. How had [his]_p477 sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again [they]_p478 must have left [it]_p479 open people often do in homes where something awful has happened. [Gregor]_n55 , in contrast, had become much calmer. So [they]_p480 couldn't understand [his]_p482 words any more, although [they]_p481 seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before - perhaps [his]_p483 ears had become used to the sound. [They]_p484 had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first response to [his]_p485 situation had been confident and wise, and that made [him]_p486 feel better.",5,,16,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p487 felt that [he]_p488 had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith [he]_p489 expected great and surprising achievements - although [he]_p489 did not really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make [his]_p491 voice as clear as possible, [he]_p492 coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and [he]_p493 was no longer sure [he]_p493 could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, [it]_p495 had become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps [his]_p496 parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps [they]_p497 were all pressed against the door and listening. [Gregor]_n56 slowly pushed [his]_p498 way over to the door with the chair. Once there [he]_p499 let go of [it]_p500 and threw [himself]_p502 onto the door, holding [himself]_p503 upright against [it]_p501 using the adhesive on the tips of [his]_p504 legs. [He]_p505 rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set [himself]_p506 to the task of turning the key in the lock with [his]_p507 mouth. [He]_p508 seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw using the jaw, [he]_p509 really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that [he]_p510 must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from [his]_p512 mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. ""[Listen]_n57 "", said the chief clerk in the next room, ""he's turning the key. "" [Gregor]_n58 was greatly encouraged by this but [they]_p513 all should have been calling to him, [his]_p516 father and [his]_p517 mother too: ""Well done, [Gregor]_n59 "", [they]_p514 should have cried, ""keep at it, keep hold of the lock!"" And with the idea that [they]_p514 were all excitedly following [his]_p517 efforts, [he]_p520 bit on the key with all [his]_p518 strength, paying no attention to the pain [he]_p521 was causing himself.",4,,34,
kafka_metamorphosis," As the key turned round [he]_p522 turned around the lock with it, only holding [himself]_p525 upright with [his]_p526 mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed [it]_p523 down again with the whole weight of [his]_p527 body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as [it]_p528 snapped back was [Gregor]_n60 's sign that [he]_p529 could break [his]_p532 concentration, and as [he]_p530 regained [his]_p533 breath [he]_p530 said to himself: ""So, [I]_p534 didn't need the locksmith after all"". Then [he]_p535 lay [his]_p536 head on the handle of the door to open [it]_p537 completely. Because [he]_p538 had to open the door in this way, [it]_p540 was already wide open before [he]_p539 could be seen. [He]_p541 had first to slowly turn [himself]_p542 around one of the double doors, and [he]_p543 had to do [it]_p545 very carefully if [he]_p544 did not want to fall flat on [his]_p546 back before entering the room. [He]_p547 was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when [he]_p548 heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud ""Oh!"", which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now [he]_p549 also saw [him]_p551 - [he]_p550 was the nearest to the door - [his]_p552 hand pressed against [his]_p553 open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. [Gregor]_n61 's mother, [her]_p554 hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked at [his]_p555 father. Then [she]_p556 unfolded [her]_p557 arms, took two steps forward towards [Gregor]_n62 and sank down onto the floor into [her]_p558 skirts that spread [themselves]_p562 out around [her]_p558 as [her]_p559 head disappeared down onto [her]_p559 breast. [His]_p563 father looked hostile, and clenched [his]_p564 fists as if wanting to knock [Gregor]_n63 back into [his]_p565 room.",4,,43,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then [he]_p566 looked uncertainly round the living room, covered [his]_p567 eyes with [his]_p568 hands and wept so that [his]_p568 powerful chest shook. So [Gregor]_n64 did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of [his]_p570 body could be seen, along with [his]_p571 head above [it]_p572 which [he]_p573 leant over to one side as [he]_p574 peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a hospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing [its]_p575 facade the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table there was so much of [it]_p576 because, for [Gregor]_n65 's father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and [he]_p578 would stretch [it]_p577 out for several hours as [he]_p579 sat reading a number of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of [Gregor]_n66 when [he]_p580 was a lieutenant in the army, [his]_p582 sword in [his]_p583 hand and a carefree smile on [his]_p583 face as [he]_p581 called forth respect for [his]_p584 uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open [he]_p586 could see onto the landing and the stairs where [they]_p587 began [their]_p588 way down below. ""Now, then"", said [Gregor]_n67 , well aware that [he]_p589 was the only one to have kept calm, ""I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up [my]_p590 samples and set off. Will [you]_p591 please just let [me]_p592 leave? [You]_p593 can see"", [he]_p594 said to the chief clerk, ""that I'm not stubborn and [I]_p595 like to do [my]_p598 job being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling [I]_p596 couldn't earn [my]_p599 living. So where are [you]_p600 going, in to the office? Yes? Will [you]_p601 report everything accurately, then? It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that's just the right time to remember what's been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, [he]_p602 will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration.",4,,36,
kafka_metamorphosis," You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt to [our]_p606 employer as well as having to look after [my]_p607 parents and [my]_p608 sister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but [I]_p603 will work [my]_p608 way out of [it]_p610 again. Please don't make things any harder for [me]_p611 than [they]_p613 are already, and don't take sides against [me]_p612 at the office. [I]_p614 know that nobody likes the travellers. [They]_p615 think [we]_p616 earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That's just prejudice but [they]_p617 have no particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, [you]_p618 have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if [I]_p620 can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss [himself]_p621 - it's very easy for a businessman like [him]_p622 to make mistakes about [his]_p623 employees and judge [them]_p624 more harshly than [he]_p625 should. And you're also well aware that [we]_p626 travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that [we]_p627 can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it's almost impossible to defend [yourself]_p631 from that sort of thing, [we]_p627 don't usually even hear about them, or if at all it's when [we]_p628 arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when [we]_p628 feel the harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don't go away, at least first say something to show that [you]_p632 grant that I'm at least partly right!"" But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as [Gregor]_n68 had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at [him]_p633 over [his]_p634 trembling shoulders as [he]_p635 left. [He]_p636 did not keep still for a moment while [Gregor]_n69 was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking [his]_p637 eyes off him. [He]_p638 moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.",2,,33,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p639 was only when [he]_p640 had reached the entrance hall that [he]_p641 made a sudden movement, drew [his]_p642 foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, [he]_p643 stretched [his]_p644 right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save him. [Gregor]_n70 realised that [it]_p645 was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if [his]_p646 position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. That was something [his]_p647 parents did not understand very well over the years, [they]_p649 had become convinced that this job would provide for [Gregor]_n71 for [his]_p648 entire life, and besides, [they]_p650 had so much to worry about at present that [they]_p650 had lost sight of any thought for the future. [Gregor]_n72 , though, did think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over the future of [Gregor]_n73 and [his]_p652 family depended on it! If only [his]_p653 sister were here! [She]_p655 was clever [she]_p656 was already in tears while [Gregor]_n74 was still lying peacefully on [his]_p653 back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely [she]_p657 could persuade [him]_p659  [she]_p658 would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk [him]_p660 out of [his]_p661 shocked state. But [his]_p662 sister was not there, [Gregor]_n75 would have to do the job himself. And without considering that [he]_p663 still was not familiar with how well [he]_p664 could move about in [his]_p667 present state, or that [his]_p668 speech still might not - or probably would not - be understood, [he]_p664 let go of the door pushed [himself]_p670 through the opening tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands but [Gregor]_n76 fell immediately over and, with a little scream as [he]_p665 sought something to hold onto, landed on [his]_p668 numerous little legs. Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, [he]_p671 began to feel alright with [his]_p675 body the little legs had the solid ground under [them]_p678 to [his]_p676 pleasure, [they]_p680 did exactly as [he]_p672 told [them]_p679 [they]_p681 were even making the effort to carry [him]_p682 where [he]_p672 wanted to go and [he]_p673 was soon believing that all [his]_p676 sorrows would soon be finally at an end.",7,,44,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p683 held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as [he]_p684 crouched there on the floor. [His]_p685 mother was not far away in front of [him]_p686 and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then [she]_p687 suddenly jumped up with [her]_p696 arms outstretched and [her]_p697 fingers spread shouting: ""Help, for pity's sake, Help!"" The way [she]_p688 held [her]_p697 head suggested [she]_p688 wanted to see [Gregor]_n77 better, but the unthinking way [she]_p689 was hurrying backwards showed that [she]_p689 did not [she]_p689 had forgotten that the table was behind [her]_p698 with all the breakfast things on [it]_p700 when [she]_p690 reached the table [she]_p690 sat quickly down on [it]_p701 without knowing what [she]_p690 was doing without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet. ""[Mother]_n78 , mother"", said [Gregor]_n79 gently, looking up at her. [He]_p702 had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help [himself]_p703 snapping in the air with [his]_p704 jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee. That set [his]_p705 mother screaming anew, [she]_p707 fled from the table and into the arms of [his]_p706 father as [he]_p708 rushed towards her. [Gregor]_n80 , though, had no time to spare for [his]_p709 parents now the chief clerk had already reached the stairs with [his]_p710 chin on the banister, [he]_p711 looked back for the last time. [Gregor]_n81 made a run for [him]_p712 [he]_p714 wanted to be sure of reaching [him]_p713 the chief clerk must have expected something, as [he]_p715 leapt down several steps at once and disappeared [his]_p716 shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put [Gregor]_n82 's father into a panic as well. Until then [he]_p717 had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding [Gregor]_n83 as [he]_p718 ran after him, [Gregor]_n84 's father seized the chief clerk's stick in [his]_p722 right hand (the chief clerk had left [it]_p727 behind on a chair, along with [his]_p723 hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with [his]_p723 left, and used [them]_p728 to d[rive G]_n85 regor back into [his]_p724 room, stamping [his]_p724 foot at [him]_p720 as [he]_p718 went. [Gregor]_n86 's appeals to [his]_p729 father were of no help, [his]_p730 appeals were simply not understood, however much [he]_p734 humbly turned [his]_p730 head [his]_p731 father merely stamped [his]_p731 foot all the harder.",10,,51,
kafka_metamorphosis," Across the room, despite the chilly weather, [Gregor]_n87 's mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of [it]_p735 and pressed [her]_p736 hands to [her]_p737 face. A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of [them]_p738 were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop [Gregor]_n88 's father as [he]_p739 drove [him]_p740 back, making hissing noises at [him]_p741 like a wild man. [Gregor]_n89 had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly. If [Gregor]_n90 had only been allowed to turn round [he]_p742 would have been back in [his]_p745 room straight away, but [he]_p743 was afraid that if [he]_p743 took the time to do that [his]_p746 father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal blow to [his]_p746 back or head from the stick in [his]_p747 father's hand any moment. Eventually, though, [Gregor]_n91 realised that [he]_p749 had no choice as [he]_p750 saw, to [his]_p753 disgust, that [he]_p750 was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line so [he]_p751 began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at [his]_p754 father, to turn [himself]_p755 round. [It]_p756 went very slowly, but perhaps [his]_p757 father was able to see [his]_p758 good intentions as [he]_p760 did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then [he]_p761 used the tip of [his]_p758 stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. If only [his]_p762 father would stop that unbearable hissing! [It]_p763 was making [Gregor]_n92 quite confused. When [he]_p764 had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, [he]_p765 made a mistake and turned [himself]_p767 back a little the way [he]_p765 had just come. [He]_p768 was pleased when [he]_p769 finally had [his]_p770 head in front of the doorway, but then saw that [it]_p772 was too narrow, and [his]_p771 body was too broad to get through [it]_p773 without further difficulty.",6,,39,
kafka_metamorphosis," In [his]_p774 present mood, [it]_p776 obviously did not occur to [his]_p775 father to open the other of the double doors so that [Gregor]_n93 would have enough space to get through. [He]_p777 was merely fixed on the idea that [Gregor]_n94 should be got back into [his]_p778 room as quickly as possible. Nor would [he]_p779 ever have allowed [Gregor]_n95 the time to get [himself]_p780 upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. What [he]_p781 did, making more noise than ever, was to drive [Gregor]_n96 forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way [it]_p782 sounded to [Gregor]_n97 as if there was now more than one father behind [him]_p784 [it]_p783 was not a pleasant experience,[ and G]_n98 regor pushed [himself]_p785 into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of [his]_p786 body lifted itself, [he]_p787 lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon [he]_p788 was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then [his]_p789 father gave [him]_p791 a hefty shove from behind which released [him]_p792 from where [he]_p794 was held and sent [him]_p792 flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into [his]_p790 room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet. II [It]_p795 was not until [it]_p796 was getting dark that evening that [Gregor]_n99 awoke from [his]_p797 deep and coma-like sleep. [He]_p798 would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if [he]_p799 hadn't been disturbed, as [he]_p800 had had enough sleep and felt fully rested. But [he]_p801 had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him.",7,,28,
kafka_metamorphosis," The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where [Gregor]_n100 was, [it]_p802 was dark. [He]_p803 pushed [himself]_p804 over to the door, feeling [his]_p805 way clumsily with [his]_p806 antennae - of which [he]_p807 was now beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been happening there. The whole of [his]_p808 left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and [he]_p810 limped badly on [his]_p809 two rows of legs. One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning - [it]_p811 was nearly a miracle that only one of [them]_p812 had been - and dragged along lifelessly. [It]_p813 was only when [he]_p814 had reached the door that [he]_p815 realised what [it]_p816 actually was that had drawn [him]_p819 over to [it]_p817 [it]_p818 was the smell of something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. [He]_p820 was so pleased [he]_p821 almost laughed, as [he]_p822 was even hungrier than [he]_p822 had been that morning, and immediately dipped [his]_p824 head into the milk, nearly covering [his]_p825 eyes with it. But [he]_p826 soon drew [his]_p828 head back again in disappointment not only did the pain in [his]_p829 tender left side make [it]_p831 difficult to eat the food - [he]_p827 was only able to eat if [his]_p829 whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the milk did not taste at all nice. Milk like this was normally [his]_p832 favourite drink, and [his]_p833 sister had certainly left [it]_p835 there for [him]_p836 because of that, but [he]_p837 turned, almost against [his]_p833 own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room. Through the crack in the door, [Gregor]_n101 could see that the gas had been lit in the living room.",2,,36,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p838 father at this time would normally be sat with [his]_p839 evening paper, reading [it]_p841 out in a loud voice to [Gregor]_n102 's mother, and sometimes to [his]_p840 sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. [Gregor]_n103 's sister would often write and tell [him]_p842 about this reading, but maybe [his]_p843 father had lost the habit in recent times. [It]_p844 was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat. ""What a quiet life [it]_p845 is the family lead"", said [Gregor]_n104 to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that [he]_p846 was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for [his]_p847 sister and parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that [Gregor]_n105 did not want to think about too much, so [he]_p848 started to move about, crawling up and down the room. Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again later on the door on the other side did the same [it]_p849 seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. [Gregor]_n106 went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who [it]_p851 was but the door was opened no more that night and [Gregor]_n107 waited in vain. The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that [he]_p852 had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides. [It]_p853 was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now [it]_p854 was easy to see that [his]_p855 parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as [they]_p856 all could be distinctly heard as [they]_p857 went away together on tip-toe. [It]_p858 was clear that no-one would come into [Gregor]_n108 's room any more until morning that gave [him]_p859 plenty of time to think undisturbed about how [he]_p860 would have to re-arrange [his]_p861 life.",7,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," For some reason, the tall, empty room where [he]_p862 was forced to remain made [him]_p865 feel uneasy as [he]_p863 lay there flat on the floor, even though [he]_p863 had been living in [it]_p866 for five years. Hardly aware of what [he]_p867 was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, [he]_p868 hurried under the couch. [It]_p869 pressed down on [his]_p870 back a little, and [he]_p874 was no longer able to lift [his]_p871 head, but [he]_p875 nonetheless felt immediately at ease and [his]_p871 only regret was that [his]_p872 body was too broad to get [it]_p876 all underneath. [He]_p877 spent the whole night there. Some of the time [he]_p878 passed in a light sleep, although [he]_p879 frequently woke from [it]_p883 in alarm because of [his]_p884 hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being [he]_p879 must remain calm, [he]_p880 must show patience and the greatest consideration so that [his]_p885 family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in [his]_p885 present condition, was forced to impose on them. [Gregor]_n109 soon had the opportunity to test the strength of [his]_p887 decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, [his]_p888 sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. [She]_p889 did not see [him]_p890 straight away, but when [she]_p892 did notice [him]_p891 under the couch - [he]_p895 had to be somewhere, for God's sake, [he]_p896 couldn't have flown away - [she]_p893 was so shocked that [she]_p893 lost control of [herself]_p897 and slammed the door shut again from outside. But [she]_p898 seemed to regret [her]_p900 behaviour, as [she]_p899 opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. [Gregor]_n110 had pushed [his]_p901 head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would [she]_p902 notice that [he]_p904 had left the milk as [it]_p907 was, realise that [it]_p908 was not from any lack of hunger and bring [him]_p911 in some other food that was more suitable? If [she]_p903 didn't do [it]_p908 [herself]_p912 [he]_p905 would rather go hungry than draw [her]_p913 attention to it, although [he]_p905 did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw [himself]_p915 at [his]_p916 sister's feet and beg [her]_p914 for something good to eat.",2,,53,
kafka_metamorphosis," However, [his]_p917 sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at [it]_p918 and the few drops of milk splashed around [it]_p919 with some surprise. [She]_p920 immediately picked [it]_p921 up - using a rag, not [her]_p923 bare hands - and carried [it]_p922 out. [Gregor]_n111 was extremely curious as to what [she]_p924 would bring in [its]_p925 place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but [he]_p926 never could have guessed what [his]_p927 sister, in [her]_p928 goodness, actually did bring. In order to test [his]_p929 taste, [she]_p930 brought [him]_p931 a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten vegetables bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard a few raisins and almonds some cheese that [Gregor]_n112 had declared inedible two days before a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. As well as all that [she]_p932 had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for [Gregor]_n113 's use, and placed [it]_p933 beside them. Then, out of consideration for [Gregor]_n114 's feelings, as [she]_p934 knew that [he]_p936 would not eat in front of her, [she]_p935 hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that [Gregor]_n115 would know [he]_p937 could make things as comfortable for [himself]_p939 as [he]_p937 liked. [Gregor]_n116 's little legs whirred, at last [he]_p940 could eat. What's more, [his]_p941 injuries must already have completely healed as [he]_p942 found no difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier [he]_p943 had cut [his]_p945 finger slightly with a knife, [he]_p944 thought of how [his]_p946 finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.",6,,30,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Am [I]_p947 less sensitive than [I]_p948 used to be, then?"", [he]_p949 thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted [him]_p950 much more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another, [his]_p951 eyes watering with pleasure, [he]_p952 consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce the fresh foods, on the other hand, [he]_p953 didn't like at all, and even dragged the things [he]_p953 did want to eat a little way away from [them]_p956 because [he]_p954 couldn't stand the smell. Long after [he]_p957 had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, [his]_p959 sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to [him]_p960 that [he]_p958 should withdraw. [He]_p961 was immediately startled, although [he]_p962 had been half asleep, and [he]_p963 hurried back under the couch. But [he]_p964 needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that [his]_p966 sister was in the room, as eating so much food had rounded out [his]_p967 body a little and [he]_p965 could hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, [he]_p968 watched with bulging eyes as [his]_p970 sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing [them]_p971 in with the food [he]_p969 had not even touched at all as if [it]_p972 could not be used any more. [She]_p973 quickly dropped [it]_p974 all into a bin, closed [it]_p975 with [its]_p976 wooden lid, and carried everything out. [She]_p977 had hardly turned [her]_p978 back before [Gregor]_n117 came out again from under the couch and stretched himself. This was how [Gregor]_n118 received [his]_p979 food each day now, once in the morning while [his]_p980 parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten [their]_p982 meal at midday as [his]_p980 parents would sleep for a little while then as well, and [Gregor]_n119 's sister would send the maid away on some errand. [Gregor]_n120 's father and mother certainly did not want [him]_p983 to starve either, but perhaps [it]_p984 would have been more than [they]_p986 could stand to have any more experience of [his]_p988 feeding than being told about it, and perhaps [his]_p989 sister wanted to spare [them]_p990 what distress [she]_p991 could as [they]_p987 were indeed suffering enough.",4,,44,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p992 was impossible for [Gregor]_n121 to find out what [they]_p993 had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get [them]_p994 out of the flat. As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even [his]_p995 sister, thought that [he]_p998 could understand them, so [he]_p999 had to be content to hear [his]_p996 sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as [she]_p1000 moved about [his]_p996 room. [It]_p1001 was only later, when [she]_p1002 had become a little more used to everything - there was, of course, no question of [her]_p1003 ever becoming fully used to the situation - that [Gregor]_n122 would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly. ""He's enjoyed [his]_p1004 dinner today"", [she]_p1005 might say when [he]_p1007 had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if [he]_p1008 left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, [she]_p1006 would often say, sadly, ""now everything's just been left there again"". Although [Gregor]_n123 wasn't able to hear any news directly [he]_p1009 did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever [he]_p1010 heard anyone speaking [he]_p1010 would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press [his]_p1012 whole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about [him]_p1013 in some way, even if only in secret. For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what [they]_p1014 should do now but even between meals [they]_p1015 spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by [themselves]_p1016 and [it]_p1017 was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had fallen to [her]_p1018 knees and begged [Gregor]_n124 's mother to let [her]_p1019 go without delay. [It]_p1020 was not very clear how much [she]_p1021 knew of what had happened but [she]_p1022 left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking [Gregor]_n125 's mother for [her]_p1024 dismissal as if [she]_p1022 had done [her]_p1025 an enormous service. [She]_p1026 even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.",5,,35,
kafka_metamorphosis," Now [Gregor]_n126 's sister also had to help [his]_p1027 mother with the cooking although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. [Gregor]_n127 often heard how one of [them]_p1028 would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than ""no thanks, I've had enough"" or something similar. No-one drank very much either. [His]_p1029 sister would sometimes ask [his]_p1030 father whether [he]_p1031 would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch [it]_p1032 herself. When [his]_p1033 father then said nothing [she]_p1035 would add, so that [he]_p1037 would not feel selfish, that [she]_p1036 could send the housekeeper for it, but then [his]_p1034 father would close the matter with a big, loud ""No"", and no more would be said. Even before the first day had come to an end, [his]_p1038 father had explained to [Gregor]_n128 's mother and sister what [their]_p1039 finances and prospects were. Now and then [he]_p1040 stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box [he]_p1041 had saved from [his]_p1042 business when [it]_p1043 had collapsed five years earlier. [Gregor]_n129 heard how [he]_p1044 opened the complicated lock and then closed [it]_p1047 again after [he]_p1045 had taken the item [he]_p1045 wanted. What [he]_p1048 heard [his]_p1050 father say was some of the first good news that [Gregor]_n130 heard since [he]_p1049 had first been incarcerated in [his]_p1051 room. [He]_p1052 had thought that nothing at all remained from [his]_p1053 father's business, at least [he]_p1054 had never told [him]_p1055 anything different, and [Gregor]_n131 had never asked [him]_p1056 about [it]_p1057 anyway.",6,,31,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Their]_p1058 business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair, and [Gregor]_n132 's only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that [they]_p1059 could all forget about [it]_p1060 as quickly as possible. So then [he]_p1061 started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour that raised [him]_p1062 from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with [it]_p1063 the chance to earn money in quite different ways. [Gregor]_n133 converted [his]_p1064 success at work straight into cash that [he]_p1066 could lay on the table at home for the benefit of [his]_p1065 astonished and delighted family. [They]_p1067 had been good times and [they]_p1068 had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though [Gregor]_n134 had later earned so much that [he]_p1069 was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. [They]_p1070 had even got used to it, both [Gregor]_n135 and the family, [they]_p1071 took the money with gratitude and [he]_p1072 was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return. [Gregor]_n136 only remained close to [his]_p1073 sister now. Unlike him, [she]_p1074 was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, [it]_p1075 was [his]_p1077 secret plan to send [her]_p1078 to the conservatory next year even though [it]_p1076 would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way. During [Gregor]_n137 's short periods in town, conversation with [his]_p1079 sister would often turn to the conservatory but [it]_p1080 was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised. [Their]_p1081 parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but [Gregor]_n138 thought about [it]_p1082 quite hard and decided [he]_p1084 would let [them]_p1086 know what [he]_p1085 planned with a grand announcement of [it]_p1083 on [Christmas]_n139 day. That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through [his]_p1087 mind in [his]_p1088 present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.",8,,31,
kafka_metamorphosis," There were times when [he]_p1089 simply became too tired to continue listening, when [his]_p1092 head would fall wearily against the door and [he]_p1090 would pull [it]_p1093 up again with a start, as even the slightest noise [he]_p1090 caused would be heard next door and [they]_p1094 would all go silent. ""What's that he's doing now"", [his]_p1095 father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again. When explaining things, [his]_p1096 father repeated [himself]_p1097 several times, partly because [it]_p1099 was a long time since [he]_p1100 had been occupied with these matters [himself]_p1098 and partly because [Gregor]_n140 's mother did not understand everything the first time. From these repeated explanations [Gregor]_n141 learned, to [his]_p1101 pleasure, that despite all [their]_p1102 misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days. [It]_p1103 was not a lot, but [it]_p1104 had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated. Besides that, [they]_p1105 had not been using up all the money that [Gregor]_n142 had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, [Gregor]_n143 nodded with enthusiasm in [his]_p1106 pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution. [He]_p1107 could actually have used this surplus money to reduce [his]_p1108 father's debt to [his]_p1109 boss, and the day when [he]_p1111 could have freed [himself]_p1112 from that job would have come much closer, but now [it]_p1113 was certainly better the way [his]_p1109 father had done things. This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest [it]_p1114 was enough to maintain [them]_p1115 for, perhaps, one or two years, no more. That's to say, [it]_p1116 was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies  money to live on had to be earned.",4,,28,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1117 father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence. During the five years that [he]_p1118 had not been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success - [he]_p1119 had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would [Gregor]_n144 's elderly mother now have to go and earn money? [She]_p1120 suffered from asthma and [it]_p1121 was a strain for [her]_p1122 just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. Would [his]_p1123 sister have to go and earn money? [She]_p1124 was still a child of seventeen, [her]_p1125 life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin. Whenever [they]_p1126 began to talk of the need to earn money, [Gregor]_n145 would always first let go of the door and then throw [himself]_p1127 onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as [he]_p1128 became quite hot with shame and regret. [He]_p1129 would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or [he]_p1130 might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it. [He]_p1131 had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing [it]_p1132 now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what [he]_p1134 actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near [he]_p1135 had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now [he]_p1135 could not see [it]_p1133 at all, and if [he]_p1136 had not known that [he]_p1136 lived in [Charlottenstrasse]_n146 , which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, [he]_p1136 could have thought that [he]_p1137 was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. [His]_p1141 observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before [she]_p1142 would always push [it]_p1144 back to [its]_p1145 exact position by the window after [she]_p1143 had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on. If [Gregor]_n147 had only been able to speak to [his]_p1146 sister and thank [her]_p1147 for all that [she]_p1148 had to do for [him]_p1149 [it]_p1152 would have been easier for [him]_p1150 to bear [it]_p1153 but as [it]_p1153 was [it]_p1154 caused [him]_p1150 pain.",4,,39,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1156 sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer [it]_p1157 went on, of course, the better [she]_p1160 was able to do so, but as time went by [Gregor]_n148 was also able to see through [it]_p1158 all so much better. [It]_p1161 had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever [she]_p1162 entered the room. No sooner had [she]_p1163 come in than [she]_p1164 would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into [Gregor]_n149 's room, then [she]_p1164 would go straight to the window and pull [it]_p1167 hurriedly open almost as if [she]_p1165 were suffocating. Even if [it]_p1168 was cold, [she]_p1169 would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. [She]_p1170 would alarm [Gregor]_n150 twice a day with this running about and noise making [he]_p1171 would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that [she]_p1172 would certainly have liked to spare [him]_p1173 this ordeal, but [it]_p1175 was impossible for [her]_p1176 to be in the same room with [him]_p1174 with the windows closed. One day, about a month after [Gregor]_n151 's transformation when [his]_p1177 sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at [his]_p1178 appearance, [she]_p1179 came into the room a little earlier than usual and found [him]_p1180 still staring out the window, motionless, and just where [he]_p1181 would be most horrible. In itself, [his]_p1182 sister's not coming into the room would have been no surprise for [Gregor]_n152 as [it]_p1183 would have been difficult for [her]_p1184 to immediately open the window while [he]_p1188 was still there, but not only did [she]_p1190 not come in, [she]_p1191 went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought [he]_p1189 had threatened [her]_p1185 and tried to bite her. [Gregor]_n153 went straight to hide [himself]_p1192 under the couch, of course, but [he]_p1193 had to wait until midday before [his]_p1194 sister came back and [she]_p1195 seemed much more uneasy than usual. [It]_p1196 made [him]_p1197 realise that [she]_p1199 still found [his]_p1202 appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, [she]_p1200 probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when [she]_p1200 saw the little bit of [him]_p1198 that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to spare [her]_p1203 even this sight, [he]_p1204 spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on [his]_p1206 back and arranged [it]_p1208 so that [he]_p1205 was completely covered and [his]_p1207 sister would not be able to see [him]_p1209 even if [she]_p1210 bent down.",6,,52,
kafka_metamorphosis," If [she]_p1211 did not think this sheet was necessary then all [she]_p1212 had to do was take [it]_p1213 off again, as [it]_p1214 was clear enough that [it]_p1214 was no pleasure for [Gregor]_n154 to cut [himself]_p1216 off so completely. [She]_p1217 left the sheet where [it]_p1218 was. [Gregor]_n155 even thought [he]_p1219 glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when [he]_p1220 carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how [his]_p1221 sister liked the new arrangement. For the first fourteen days, [Gregor]_n156 's parents could not bring [themselves]_p1222 to come into the room to see him. [He]_p1223 would often hear [them]_p1224 say how [they]_p1225 appreciated all the new work [his]_p1227 sister was doing even though, before, [they]_p1226 had seen [her]_p1228 as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of [Gregor]_n157 's room while [his]_p1232 sister tidied up in there, and as soon as [she]_p1233 went out again [she]_p1234 would have to tell [them]_p1230 exactly how everything looked, what [Gregor]_n158 had eaten, how [he]_p1235 had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. [His]_p1236 mother also wanted to go in and visit [Gregor]_n159 relatively soon but [his]_p1237 father and sister at first persuaded [her]_p1238 against it. [Gregor]_n160 listened very closely to all this, and approved fully. Later, though, [she]_p1239 had to be held back by force, which made [her]_p1242 call out: ""Let [me]_p1244 go and see [Gregor]_n161 , [he]_p1245 is [my]_p1246 unfortunate son! Can't [you]_p1247 understand [I]_p1248 have to see him?"", and [Gregor]_n162 would think to [himself]_p1249 that maybe [it]_p1250 would be better if [his]_p1251 mother came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps [she]_p1240 could understand everything much better than [his]_p1252 sister who, for all [her]_p1243 courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult's appreciation of the burdensome job [she]_p1240 had taken on. [Gregor]_n163 's wish to see [his]_p1253 mother was soon realised.",10,,41,
kafka_metamorphosis," Out of consideration for [his]_p1254 parents, [Gregor]_n164 wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give [him]_p1256 much room to crawl about, [it]_p1258 was hard to just lie quietly through the night, [his]_p1255 food soon stopped giving [him]_p1257 any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, [he]_p1259 got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling. [He]_p1260 was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling [it]_p1261 was quite different from lying on the floor [he]_p1264 could breathe more freely [his]_p1266 body had a light swing to [it]_p1262 and up there, relaxed and almost happy, [it]_p1262 might happen that [he]_p1265 would surprise even [himself]_p1267 by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of course, [he]_p1268 had far better control of [his]_p1269 body than before and, even with a fall as great as that, caused [himself]_p1270 no damage. Very soon [his]_p1271 sister noticed [Gregor]_n165 's new way of entertaining [himself]_p1274 - [he]_p1275 had, after all, left traces of the adhesive from [his]_p1272 feet as [he]_p1276 crawled about - and got [it]_p1277 into [her]_p1279 head to make [it]_p1278 as easy as possible for [him]_p1280 by removing the furniture that got in [his]_p1272 way, especially the chest of drawers and the desk. Now, this was not something that [she]_p1281 would be able to do by [herself]_p1285 [she]_p1282 did not dare to ask for help from [her]_p1286 father the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but [she]_p1282 certainly would not have helped in this, [she]_p1283 had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless [it]_p1288 was especially important so [his]_p1289 sister had no choice but to choose some time when [Gregor]_n166 's father was not there and fetch [his]_p1290 mother to help her. As [she]_p1291 approached the room, [Gregor]_n167 could hear [his]_p1293 mother express [her]_p1294 joy, but once at the door [she]_p1292 went silent. First, of course, [his]_p1295 sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright and only then did [she]_p1296 let [her]_p1297 mother enter. [Gregor]_n168 had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into [it]_p1298 so that everything really looked as if [it]_p1299 had just been thrown down by chance. [Gregor]_n169 also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet [he]_p1300 gave up the chance to see [his]_p1301 mother until later and was simply glad that [she]_p1302 had come. ""You can come in, [he]_p1303 can't be seen"", said [his]_p1304 sister, obviously leading [her]_p1305 in by the hand.",6,,51,
kafka_metamorphosis," The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but [Gregor]_n170 listened as [they]_p1306 pushed [it]_p1307 from [its]_p1308 place, [his]_p1309 sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for [herself]_p1310 and ignoring [her]_p1312 mother's warnings that [she]_p1313 would strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at [it]_p1314 for fifteen minutes or more [his]_p1321 mother said [it]_p1315 would be better to leave the chest where [it]_p1315 was, for one thing [it]_p1316 was too heavy for [them]_p1323 to get the job finished before [Gregor]_n171 's father got home and leaving [it]_p1316 in the middle of the room [it]_p1316 would be in [his]_p1322 way even more, and for another thing [it]_p1317 wasn't even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. [She]_p1324 thought just the opposite the sight of the bare walls saddened [her]_p1325 right to [her]_p1326 heart and why wouldn't [Gregor]_n172 feel the same way about it, he'd been used to this furniture in [his]_p1329 room for a long time and [it]_p1327 would make [him]_p1330 feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting [Gregor]_n173 (whose whereabouts [she]_p1331 did not know) to hear not even the tone of [her]_p1334 voice, as [she]_p1332 was convinced that [he]_p1336 did not understand [her]_p1335 words, [she]_p1332 added ""and by taking the furniture away, won't [it]_p1339 seem like we're showing that we've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning [him]_p1342 to cope for himself? [I]_p1343 think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the way [it]_p1340 was before so that when [Gregor]_n174 comes back to [us]_p1344 again he'll find everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in between all the easier"". Hearing these words from [his]_p1345 mother made [Gregor]_n175 realise that the lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made [him]_p1347 confused - [he]_p1348 could think of no other way of explaining to [himself]_p1350 why [he]_p1349 had seriously wanted [his]_p1346 room emptied out. Had [he]_p1351 really wanted to transform [his]_p1354 room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture [he]_p1352 had inherited? That would have let [him]_p1356 crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but [it]_p1358 would also have let [him]_p1357 quickly forget [his]_p1355 past when [he]_p1352 had still been human. [He]_p1359 had come very close to forgetting, and [it]_p1360 had only been the voice of [his]_p1362 mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken [him]_p1363 out of it. Nothing should be removed everything had to stay [he]_p1364 could not do without the good influence the furniture had on [his]_p1365 condition and if the furniture made [it]_p1366 difficult for [him]_p1367 to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage. [His]_p1368 sister, unfortunately, did not agree [she]_p1369 had become used to the idea, not without reason, that [she]_p1370 was [Gregor]_n176 's spokesman to [his]_p1371 parents about the things that concerned him.",7,,60,
kafka_metamorphosis," This meant that [his]_p1372 mother's advice now was sufficient reason for [her]_p1373 to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as [she]_p1374 had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. [It]_p1375 was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence [she]_p1376 had recently acquired, that made [her]_p1378 insist [she]_p1377 had indeed noticed that [Gregor]_n177 needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to [him]_p1379 at all. Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel [they]_p1380 must get [their]_p1382 way whenever [they]_p1381 can. Perhaps this was what tempted [Grete]_n178 to make [Gregor]_n179 's situation seem even more shocking than [it]_p1383 was so that [she]_p1384 could do even more for him. [Grete]_n180 would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by [Gregor]_n181 crawling about the bare walls by himself. So [she]_p1385 refused to let [her]_p1386 mother dissuade her. [Gregor]_n182 's mother already looked uneasy in [his]_p1388 room, [she]_p1389 soon stopped speaking and helped [Gregor]_n183 's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength [she]_p1390 had. The chest of drawers was something that [Gregor]_n184 could do without if [he]_p1391 had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than [Gregor]_n185 poked [his]_p1392 head out from under the couch to see what [he]_p1393 could do about it. [He]_p1394 meant to be as careful and considerate as [he]_p1395 could, but, unfortunately, [it]_p1396 was [his]_p1399 mother who came back first while [Grete]_n186 in the next room had [her]_p1400 arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at [it]_p1397 from side to side by [herself]_p1401 without, of course, moving [it]_p1397 an inch.",10,,29,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1402 mother was not used to the sight of [Gregor]_n187 , [he]_p1403 might have made [her]_p1404 ill, so [Gregor]_n188 hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In [his]_p1405 startlement, though, [he]_p1406 was not able to prevent the sheet at [its]_p1407 front from moving a little. [It]_p1408 was enough to attract [his]_p1409 mother's attention. [She]_p1410 stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to [Grete]_n189. [Gregor]_n190 kept trying to assure [himself]_p1411 that nothing unusual was happening, [it]_p1412 was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but [he]_p1413 soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, [their]_p1415 little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made [him]_p1416 feel as if [he]_p1414 were being assailed from all sides. With [his]_p1417 head and legs pulled in against [him]_p1419 and [his]_p1418 body pressed to the floor, [he]_p1420 was forced to admit to [himself]_p1422 that [he]_p1421 could not stand all of this much longer. [They]_p1423 were emptying [his]_p1424 room out taking away everything that was dear to [him]_p1427 [they]_p1428 had already taken out the chest containing [his]_p1425 fretsaw and other tools  now [they]_p1429 threatened to remove the writing desk with [its]_p1430 place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where [he]_p1431 had done [his]_p1425 homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while [he]_p1432 had been at infant school, [he]_p1432 really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women's intentions were good. [He]_p1434 had nearly forgotten [they]_p1435 were there anyway, as [they]_p1436 were now too tired to say anything while [they]_p1436 worked and [he]_p1439 could only hear [their]_p1440 feet as [they]_p1437 stepped heavily on the floor. So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching [their]_p1441 breath, [he]_p1442 sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what [he]_p1443 should save first before [his]_p1444 attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was already denuded of everything else that had been on [it]_p1445 - of the lady dressed in copious fur. [He]_p1446 hurried up onto the picture and pressed [himself]_p1447 against [its]_p1448 glass, [it]_p1449 held [him]_p1450 firmly and felt good on [his]_p1451 hot belly.",4,,50,
kafka_metamorphosis," This picture at least, now totally covered by [Gregor]_n191 , would certainly be taken away by no-one. [He]_p1452 turned [his]_p1453 head to face the door into the living room so that [he]_p1454 could watch the women when [they]_p1455 came back. [They]_p1456 had not allowed [themselves]_p1457 a long rest and came back quite soon [Grete]_n192 had put [her]_p1458 arm around [her]_p1459 mother and was nearly carrying her. ""What shall [we]_p1461 take now, then?"", said [Grete]_n193 and looked around. [Her]_p1462 eyes met those of [Gregor]_n194 on the wall. Perhaps only because [her]_p1463 mother was there, [she]_p1468 remained calm, bent [her]_p1464 face to [her]_p1464 so that [she]_p1469 would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in [her]_p1465 voice: ""Come on, let's go back in the living room for a while?"" [Gregor]_n195 could see what [Grete]_n196 had in mind, [she]_p1469 wanted to take [her]_p1465 mother somewhere safe and then chase [him]_p1471 down from the wall. Well, [she]_p1472 could certainly try it! [He]_p1473 sat unyielding on [his]_p1474 picture. [He]_p1475 would rather jump at [Grete]_n197 's face. But [Grete]_n198 's words had made [her]_p1476 mother quite worried, [she]_p1477 stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before [she]_p1478 even realised [it]_p1482 was [Gregor]_n199 that [she]_p1478 saw screamed: ""Oh God, oh God!"" Arms outstretched, [she]_p1479 fell onto the couch as if [she]_p1479 had given up everything and stayed there immobile. ""[Gregor]_n200 !"" shouted [his]_p1483 sister, glowering at [him]_p1484 and shaking [her]_p1485 fist.",10,,33,
kafka_metamorphosis," That was the first word [she]_p1486 had spoken to [him]_p1487 directly since [his]_p1488 transformation. [She]_p1489 ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring [her]_p1490 mother out of [her]_p1491 faint [Gregor]_n201 wanted to help too - [he]_p1496 could save [his]_p1502 picture later, although [he]_p1497 stuck fast to the glass and had to pull [himself]_p1504 off by force then he, too, ran into the next room as if [he]_p1497 could advise [his]_p1503 sister like in the old days but [he]_p1498 had to just stand behind [her]_p1491 doing nothing [she]_p1505 was looking into various bottles, [he]_p1498 startled [her]_p1492 when [she]_p1506 turned round a bottle fell to the ground and broke a splinter cut [Gregor]_n202 's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over [him]_p1509 now, without delaying any longer, [Grete]_n203 took hold of all the bottles [she]_p1506 could and ran with [them]_p1510 in to [her]_p1492 mother [she]_p1507 slammed the door shut with [her]_p1492 foot. So now [Gregor]_n204 was shut out from [his]_p1511 mother, who, because of him, might be near to death [he]_p1518 could not open the door if [he]_p1519 did not want to chase [his]_p1512 sister away, and [she]_p1523 had to stay with [his]_p1512 mother there was nothing for [him]_p1515 to do but wait and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, [he]_p1519 began to crawl about, [he]_p1520 crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in [his]_p1513 confusion as the whole room began to spin around [him]_p1516 [he]_p1520 fell down into the middle of the dinner table. [He]_p1524 lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around [him]_p1525 [it]_p1526 was quiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door. The maid, of course, had locked [herself]_p1527 in [her]_p1528 kitchen so that [Grete]_n205 would have to go and answer it. [His]_p1529 father had arrived home. ""What's happened?"" were [his]_p1530 first words [Grete]_n206 's appearance must have made everything clear to him. [She]_p1531 answered [him]_p1532 with subdued voice, and openly pressed [her]_p1533 face into [his]_p1534 chest: ""[Mother]_n207 's fainted, but she's better now. [Gregor]_n208 got out.",8,,47,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" ""Just as [I]_p1535 expected"", said [his]_p1537 father, ""just as [I]_p1536 always said, but [you]_p1538 women wouldn't listen, would you. "" [It]_p1540 was clear to [Gregor]_n209 that [Grete]_n210 had not said enough and that [his]_p1541 father took [it]_p1542 to mean that something bad had happened, that [he]_p1543 was responsible for some act of violence. That meant [Gregor]_n211 would now have to try to calm [his]_p1544 father, as [he]_p1545 did not have the time to explain things to [him]_p1546 even if that had been possible. So [he]_p1547 fled to the door of [his]_p1550 room and pressed [himself]_p1553 against [it]_p1554 so that [his]_p1551 father, when [he]_p1548 came in from the hall, could see straight away that [Gregor]_n212 had the best intentions and would go back into [his]_p1551 room without delay, that [it]_p1555 would not be necessary to drive [him]_p1556 back but that [they]_p1557 had only to open the door and [he]_p1548 would disappear. [His]_p1558 father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that ""Ah!"", [he]_p1559 shouted as [he]_p1560 came in, sounding as if [he]_p1560 were both angry and glad at the same time. [Gregor]_n213 drew [his]_p1562 head back from the door and lifted [it]_p1564 towards [his]_p1563 father. [He]_p1565 really had not imagined [his]_p1566 father the way [he]_p1568 stood there now of late, with [his]_p1567 new habit of crawling about, [he]_p1569 had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way [he]_p1569 had done before. [He]_p1571 really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really [his]_p1572 father? The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in [his]_p1573 bed when [Gregor]_n214 came back from [his]_p1573 business trips, who would receive [him]_p1584 sitting in the armchair in [his]_p1574 nightgown when [he]_p1586 came back in the evenings who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of [his]_p1574 pleasure, would just raise [his]_p1574 arms and who, on the couple of times a year when [they]_p1588 went for a walk together on a [Sunday]_n215 or public holiday wrapped up tightly in [his]_p1575 overcoat between [Gregor]_n216 and [his]_p1575 mother, would always labour [his]_p1575 way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for [his]_p1575 sake who would place [his]_p1576 stick down carefully and, if [he]_p1587 wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather [his]_p1576 companions around him. [He]_p1589 was standing up straight enough now  dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute above the high, stiff collar of the coat [his]_p1590 strong double-chin emerged under the bushy eyebrows, [his]_p1591 piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert [his]_p1591 normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to [his]_p1592 scalp. [He]_p1594 took [his]_p1595 cap, with [its]_p1599 gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw [it]_p1600 in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put [his]_p1596 hands in [his]_p1596 trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of [his]_p1597 long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards [Gregor]_n217.",9,,64,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1601 probably did not even know [himself]_p1602 what [he]_p1603 had in mind, but nonetheless lifted [his]_p1604 feet unusually high. [Gregor]_n218 was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of [his]_p1605 boots, but wasted no time with that - [he]_p1608 knew full well, right from the first day of [his]_p1606 new life, that [his]_p1606 father thought [it]_p1609 necessary to always be extremely strict with him. And so [he]_p1610 ran up to [his]_p1612 father, stopped when [his]_p1613 father stopped, scurried forwards again when [he]_p1611 moved, even slightly. In this way [they]_p1614 went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly. [Gregor]_n219 remained all this time on the floor, largely because [he]_p1615 feared [his]_p1617 father might see [it]_p1618 as especially provoking if [he]_p1616 fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever [he]_p1619 did, [Gregor]_n220 had to admit that [he]_p1620 certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step [his]_p1622 father took [he]_p1620 had to carry out countless movements. [He]_p1623 became noticeably short of breath, even in [his]_p1624 earlier life [his]_p1625 lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as [he]_p1626 lurched about in [his]_p1630 efforts to muster all the strength [he]_p1627 could for running [he]_p1627 could hardly keep [his]_p1631 eyes open [his]_p1631 thoughts became too slow for [him]_p1633 to think of any other way of saving [himself]_p1637 than running [he]_p1628 almost forgot that the walls were there for [him]_p1634 to use although, here, [they]_p1638 were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and rolled in front of him. [It]_p1639 was an apple then another one immediately flew at [him]_p1640 [Gregor]_n221 froze in shock there was no longer any point in running as [his]_p1642 father had decided to bombard him. [He]_p1643 had filled [his]_p1644 pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another.",4,,41,
kafka_metamorphosis," These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if [they]_p1645 had electric motors. An apple thrown without much force glanced against [Gregor]_n222 's back and slid off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in [his]_p1646 back [Gregor]_n223 wanted to drag [himself]_p1649 away, as if [he]_p1651 could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing [his]_p1647 position but [he]_p1652 felt as if nailed to the spot and spread [himself]_p1650 out, all [his]_p1647 senses in confusion. The last thing [he]_p1653 saw was the door of [his]_p1654 room being pulled open, [his]_p1655 sister was screaming, [his]_p1655 mother ran out in front of [her]_p1662 in [her]_p1663 blouse (as [his]_p1656 sister had taken off some of [her]_p1663 clothes after [she]_p1669 had fainted to make [it]_p1672 easier for [her]_p1664 to breathe), [she]_p1670 ran to [his]_p1656 father, [her]_p1664 skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts [she]_p1670 pushed [herself]_p1673 to [his]_p1656 father, [her]_p1664 arms around him, uniting [herself]_p1674 with [him]_p1675 totally - now [Gregor]_n224 lost [his]_p1657 ability to see anything - [her]_p1665 hands behind [his]_p1657 father's head begging [him]_p1676 to spare [Gregor]_n225 's life. III No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in [Gregor]_n226 's flesh, so [it]_p1678 remained there as a visible reminder of [his]_p1679 injury. [He]_p1680 had suffered [it]_p1681 there for more than a month, and [his]_p1682 condition seemed serious enough to remind even [his]_p1683 father that [Gregor]_n227 , despite [his]_p1683 current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for [him]_p1685 and to be patient, just to be patient. Because of [his]_p1686 injuries, [Gregor]_n228 had lost much of [his]_p1687 mobility - probably permanently. [He]_p1688 had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and [it]_p1689 took [him]_p1690 long, long minutes to crawl across [his]_p1691 room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but this deterioration in [his]_p1692 condition was fully (in [his]_p1692 opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening. [He]_p1694 got into the habit of closely watching [it]_p1695 for one or two hours before [it]_p1696 was opened and then, lying in the darkness of [his]_p1697 room where [he]_p1698 could not be seen from the living room, [he]_p1699 could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to [their]_p1700 conversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before.",7,,55,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p1701 no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, the ones that [Gregor]_n229 always thought about with longing when [he]_p1702 was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All of [them]_p1703 were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, [his]_p1704 father would go to sleep in [his]_p1705 chair [his]_p1705 mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet [his]_p1706 mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop [his]_p1706 sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that [she]_p1709 might be able to get a better position later on. Sometimes [his]_p1710 father would wake up and say to [Gregor]_n230 's mother ""you're doing so much sewing again today!"", as if [he]_p1711 did not know that [he]_p1712 had been dozing - and then [he]_p1712 would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin. With a kind of stubbornness, [Gregor]_n231 's father refused to take [his]_p1714 uniform off even at home while [his]_p1715 nightgown hung unused on [its]_p1717 peg [Gregor]_n232 's father would slumber where [he]_p1718 was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of [his]_p1715 superior even here. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this [it]_p1719 slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of [Gregor]_n233 's mother and sister to look after it. [Gregor]_n234 would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with [its]_p1721 gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in [it]_p1722 would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful. As soon as [it]_p1723 struck ten, [Gregor]_n235 's mother would speak gently to [his]_p1724 father to wake [him]_p1726 and try to persuade [him]_p1727 to go to bed, as [he]_p1728 couldn't sleep properly where [he]_p1729 was and [he]_p1729 really had to get [his]_p1725 sleep if [he]_p1730 was to be up at six to get to work. But since [he]_p1732 had been in work [he]_p1733 had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though [he]_p1733 regularly fell asleep and [it]_p1735 was then harder than ever to persuade [him]_p1736 to exchange the chair for [his]_p1737 bed. Then, however much mother and sister would importune [him]_p1738 with little reproaches and warnings [he]_p1739 would keep slowly shaking [his]_p1740 head for a quarter of an hour with [his]_p1741 eyes closed and refusing to get up.",7,,40,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n236 's mother would tug at [his]_p1742 sleeve, whisper endearments into [his]_p1743 ear, [Gregor]_n237 's sister would leave [her]_p1744 work to help [her]_p1745 mother, but nothing would have any effect on him. [He]_p1746 would just sink deeper into [his]_p1747 chair. Only when the two women took [him]_p1748 under the arms [he]_p1751 would abruptly open [his]_p1754 eyes, look at [them]_p1757 one after the other and say: ""What a life! This is what peace [I]_p1759 get in [my]_p1760 old age!"" And supported by the two women [he]_p1752 would lift [himself]_p1761 up carefully as if [he]_p1752 were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take [him]_p1749 to the door, send [them]_p1758 off and carry on by [himself]_p1762 while [Gregor]_n238 's mother would throw down [her]_p1764 needle and [his]_p1755 sister [her]_p1765 pen so that [they]_p1766 could run after [his]_p1755 father and continue being of help to him. Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to [Gregor]_n239 than was absolutely necessary? The household budget became even smaller so now the maid was dismissed an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around [her]_p1767 head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work everything else was looked after by [Gregor]_n240 's mother on top of the large amount of sewing work [she]_p1768 did. [Gregor]_n241 even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price [they]_p1769 had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing [them]_p1770 at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for [their]_p1771 present circumstances, [they]_p1772 could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring [Gregor]_n242 to the new address. [He]_p1773 could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for [him]_p1774 that made [it]_p1776 difficult for [them]_p1779 to move, [it]_p1777 would have been quite easy to transport [him]_p1775 in any suitable crate with a few air holes in [it]_p1777 the main thing holding the family back from [their]_p1780 decision to move was much more to do with [their]_p1781 total despair, and the thought that [they]_p1782 had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else [they]_p1783 knew or were related to. [They]_p1784 carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, [Gregor]_n243 's father brought bank employees [their]_p1785 breakfast, [his]_p1786 mother sacrificed [herself]_p1788 by washing clothes for strangers, [his]_p1787 sister ran back and forth behind [her]_p1789 desk at the behest of the customers, but [they]_p1790 just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in [Gregor]_n244 's back began to hurt as much as when [it]_p1791 was new. After [they]_p1792 had come back from taking [his]_p1795 father to bed [Gregor]_n245 's mother and sister would now leave [their]_p1797 work where [it]_p1799 was and sit close together, cheek to cheek [his]_p1796 mother would point to [Gregor]_n246 's room and say ""Close that door, [Grete]_n247 "", and then, when [he]_p1800 was in the dark again, [they]_p1793 would sit in the next room and [their]_p1798 tears would mingle, or [they]_p1793 would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.",12,,57,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n248 hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes [he]_p1801 would think of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened [he]_p1802 had long forgotten about [his]_p1805 boss and the chief clerk, but [they]_p1809 would appear again in [his]_p1806 thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom [his]_p1806 attention had been serious but too slow, - all of [them]_p1812 appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others [he]_p1802 had forgotten, but instead of helping [him]_p1814 and [his]_p1807 family [they]_p1810 were all of [them]_p1813 inaccessible, and [he]_p1803 was glad when [they]_p1810 disappeared. Other times [he]_p1816 was not at all in the mood to look after [his]_p1826 family, [he]_p1817 was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention [he]_p1817 was shown, and although [he]_p1818 could think of nothing [he]_p1818 would have wanted, [he]_p1818 made plans of how [he]_p1819 could get into the pantry where [he]_p1819 could take all the things [he]_p1819 was entitled to, even if [he]_p1819 was not hungry. [Gregor]_n249 's sister no longer thought about how [she]_p1827 could please [him]_p1830 but would hurriedly push some food or other into [his]_p1831 room with [her]_p1832 foot before [she]_p1828 rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening [she]_p1828 would sweep [it]_p1833 away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether [it]_p1834 had been eaten or - more often than not - had been left totally untouched. [She]_p1835 still cleared up the room in the evening, but now [she]_p1836 could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, [Gregor]_n250 went into one of the worst of these places when [his]_p1837 sister arrived as a reproach to her, but [he]_p1839 could have stayed there for weeks without [his]_p1838 sister doing anything about [it]_p1841 [she]_p1843 could see the dirt as well as [he]_p1840 could but [she]_p1844 had simply decided to leave [him]_p1845 to it. At the same time [she]_p1846 became touchy in a way that was quite new for [her]_p1847 and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up [Gregor]_n251 's room was for [her]_p1848 and [her]_p1848 alone. [Gregor]_n252 's mother did once thoroughly clean [his]_p1850 room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do [it]_p1851 - although that much dampness also made [Gregor]_n253 ill and [he]_p1852 lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But [his]_p1853 mother was to be punished still more for what [she]_p1855 had done, as hardly had [his]_p1854 sister arrived home in the evening than [she]_p1856 noticed the change in [Gregor]_n254 's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room where, despite [her]_p1858 mothers raised and imploring hands, [she]_p1856 broke into convulsive tears.",7,,56,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Her]_p1859 father, of course, was startled out of [his]_p1860 chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless then they, too, became agitated [Gregor]_n255 's father, standing to the right of [his]_p1861 mother, accused [her]_p1866 of not leaving the cleaning of [Gregor]_n256 's room to [his]_p1861 sister from [her]_p1867 l[eft, G]_n257 regor's sister screamed at [her]_p1867 that [she]_p1870 was never[ to cl]_n258 ean Gregor's room again while [his]_p1862 mother tried to draw [his]_p1862 father, who was beside [himself]_p1871 with anger, into the bedroom [his]_p1862 sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with [her]_p1868 s[mall f]_n259 ists and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save [him]_p1872 the sight of this and all [its]_p1873 noise. [Gregor]_n260 's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after [Gregor]_n261 as [she]_p1874 had done before was even more work for her, but even so [his]_p1877 mother ought certainly not to have taken [her]_p1875 place. [Gregor]_n262 , on the other hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was here. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made [her]_p1878 able to withstand the hardest of things in [her]_p1879 long life, wasn't really repelled by [Gregor]_n263. Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, [she]_p1880 opened the door to [Gregor]_n264 's room and found [herself]_p1881 face to face with him. [He]_p1882 was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing [him]_p1883 but [he]_p1884 began to rush to and fro while [she]_p1885 just stood there in amazement with [her]_p1886 hands crossed in front of her. From then on [she]_p1888 never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him. At first [she]_p1889 would call to [him]_p1892 as [she]_p1890 did so with words that [she]_p1890 probably considered friendly, such as ""come on then, [you]_p1893 old dung-beetle!"", or ""look at the old dung-beetle there!"" [Gregor]_n265 never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where [he]_p1894 was without moving as if the door had never even been opened. If only [they]_p1895 had told this charwoman to clean up [his]_p1896 room every day instead of letting [her]_p1897 disturb [him]_p1898 for no reason whenever [she]_p1900 felt like it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, [she]_p1901 began to speak to [him]_p1899 in that way once again.",11,,41,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n266 was so resentful of [it]_p1902 that [he]_p1904 started to move toward her, [he]_p1905 was slow and infirm, but [it]_p1903 was like a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with [her]_p1906 mouth open, clearly intending not to close [her]_p1907 mouth until the chair in [her]_p1907 hand had been slammed down into [Gregor]_n267 's back. ""Aren't [you]_p1909 coming any closer, then?"", [she]_p1910 asked when [Gregor]_n268 turned round again, and [she]_p1911 calmly put the chair back in the corner. [Gregor]_n269 had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if [he]_p1912 happened to find [himself]_p1914 next to the food that had been prepared for [him]_p1915 [he]_p1913 might take some of [it]_p1916 into [his]_p1920 mouth to play with it, leave [it]_p1917 there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit [it]_p1917 out again. At first [he]_p1921 thought [it]_p1923 was distress at the state of [his]_p1924 room that stopped [him]_p1925 eating, but [he]_p1922 had soon got used to the changes made there. [They]_p1926 had got into the habit of putting things into this room that [they]_p1927 had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen - all three of [them]_p1928 had full beards, as [Gregor]_n270 learned peering through the crack in the door one day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy. This meant not only in [their]_p1929 own room but, since [they]_p1930 had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something [they]_p1931 could not tolerate, especially if [it]_p1932 was dirty.",5,,30,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p1933 had moreover brought most of [their]_p1934 own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although [they]_p1935 could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found [their]_p1936 way into [Gregor]_n271 's room. The dustbins from the kitchen found [their]_p1937 way in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything [she]_p1938 couldn't use for the time being [she]_p1939 would just chuck in there. He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when [she]_p1940 had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that [they]_p1941 were left where [they]_p1942 landed when [they]_p1942 had first been thrown unless [Gregor]_n272 made [his]_p1944 way through the junk and moved [it]_p1945 somewhere else. At first [he]_p1946 moved [it]_p1951 because, with no other room free where [he]_p1947 could crawl about, [he]_p1947 was forced to, but later on [he]_p1948 came to enjoy [it]_p1952 although moving about in that way left [him]_p1953 sad and tired to death, and [he]_p1948 would remain immobile for hours afterwards. The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take [their]_p1954 evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But [Gregor]_n273 found [it]_p1955 easy to give up having the door open, [he]_p1959 had, after all, often failed to make use of [it]_p1956 when [it]_p1956 was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in [his]_p1960 room in [its]_p1961 darkest corner.",3,,28,
kafka_metamorphosis," One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and [it]_p1962 remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on. [They]_p1963 sat up at the table where, formerly, [Gregor]_n274 had taken [his]_p1964 meals with [his]_p1965 father and mother, [they]_p1966 unfolded the serviettes and picked up [their]_p1967 knives and forks. [Gregor]_n275 's mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind [her]_p1968 came [his]_p1969 sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The food was steaming, and filled the room with [its]_p1970 smell. The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of [them]_p1971 as if [they]_p1972 wanted to test the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while [it]_p1973 was still in [its]_p1977 dish, clearly wishing to establish whether [it]_p1974 was sufficiently cooked or whether [it]_p1974 should be sent back to the kitchen. [It]_p1978 was to [his]_p1979 satisfaction, and [Gregor]_n276 's mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled. The family [themselves]_p1980 ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, [Gregor]_n277 's father came into the living room before [he]_p1981 went into the kitchen, bowed once with [his]_p1982 cap in [his]_p1983 hand and did [his]_p1983 round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into [their]_p1985 beards. Then, once [they]_p1986 were alone, [they]_p1987 ate in near perfect silence.",4,,25,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p1988 seemed remarkable to [Gregor]_n278 that above all the various noises of eating [their]_p1989 chewing teeth could still be heard, as if [they]_p1990 had wanted to show [Gregor]_n279 that [you]_p1992 need teeth in order to eat and [it]_p1993 was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice [they]_p1991 might be. ""I'd like to eat something"", said [Gregor]_n280 anxiously, ""but not anything like they're eating. [They]_p1994 do feed themselves. And here [I]_p1995 am, dying!"" Throughout all this time, [Gregor]_n281 could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening [it]_p1996 began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished [their]_p1997 meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now [they]_p1999 leant back in [their]_p1998 chairs reading [them]_p2000 and smoking. When the violin began playing [they]_p2001 became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where [they]_p2002 stood pressed against each other. Someone must have heard [them]_p2003 in the kitchen, as [Gregor]_n282 's father called out: ""Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen? [We]_p2004 can stop [it]_p2005 straight away. "" ""On the contrary"", said the middle gentleman, ""would the young lady not like to come in and play for [us]_p2006 here in the room, where [it]_p2007 is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?"" ""Oh yes, we'd love to"", called back [Gregor]_n283 's father as if [he]_p2008 had been the violin player himself. The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. [Gregor]_n284 's father soon appeared with the music stand, [his]_p2009 mother with the music and [his]_p2010 sister with the violin.",7,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p2011 calmly prepared everything for [her]_p2012 to begin playing [his]_p2013 parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on [their]_p2018 own chairs [his]_p2014 father leant against the door with [his]_p2014 right hand pushed in between two buttons on [his]_p2015 uniform coat [his]_p2015 mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed [it]_p2019 - out of the way in a corner. [His]_p2020 sister began to play father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of [her]_p2021 hands. Drawn in by the playing, [Gregor]_n285 had dared to come forward a little and already had [his]_p2022 head in the living room. Before, [he]_p2023 had taken great pride in how considerate [he]_p2024 was but now [it]_p2026 hardly occurred to [him]_p2027 that [he]_p2024 had become so thoughtless about the others. What's more, there was now all the more reason to keep [himself]_p2028 hidden as [he]_p2030 was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in [his]_p2034 room and flew up at the slightest movement [he]_p2031 carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on [his]_p2035 back and sides [he]_p2031 was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on [his]_p2035 back and wipe [himself]_p2029 on the carpet like [he]_p2032 had used to do several times a day. And despite this condition, [he]_p2037 was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room. No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing at first, the three gentlemen had put [their]_p2038 hands in [their]_p2039 pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played, and [they]_p2041 must have disturbed [Gregor]_n286 's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, [they]_p2042 withdrew back to the window with [their]_p2039 heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and [they]_p2042 stayed by the window while [Gregor]_n287 's father observed [them]_p2044 anxiously. [It]_p2045 really now seemed very obvious that [they]_p2046 had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that [they]_p2047 had had enough of the whole performance and [it]_p2049 was only now out of politeness that [they]_p2047 allowed [their]_p2050 peace to be disturbed. [It]_p2051 was especially unnerving, the way [they]_p2052 all blew the smoke from [their]_p2053 cigarettes upwards from [their]_p2054 mouth and noses.",3,,44,
kafka_metamorphosis," Yet [Gregor]_n288 's sister was playing so beautifully. [Her]_p2055 face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. [Gregor]_n289 crawled a little further forward, keeping [his]_p2056 head close to the ground so that [he]_p2057 could meet [her]_p2058 eyes if the chance came. Was [he]_p2059 an animal if music could captivate [him]_p2062 so? [It]_p2064 seemed to [him]_p2063 that [he]_p2060 was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment [he]_p2060 had been yearning for. [He]_p2065 was determined to make [his]_p2066 way forward to [his]_p2067 sister and tug at [her]_p2069 skirt to show [her]_p2070 [she]_p2073 might come into [his]_p2067 room with [her]_p2070 violin, as no-one appreciated [her]_p2071 playing here as much as [he]_p2074 would. [He]_p2075 never wanted to let [her]_p2076 out of [his]_p2081 room, not while [he]_p2085 lived, anyway [his]_p2082 shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to [him]_p2090 [he]_p2086 wanted to be at every door of [his]_p2082 room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers [his]_p2083 sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of [her]_p2077 own free will [she]_p2095 would sit beside [him]_p2091 on the couch with [her]_p2077 ear bent down to [him]_p2091 while [he]_p2086 told [her]_p2078 how [he]_p2087 had always intended to send [her]_p2078 to the conservatory, how [he]_p2087 would have told everyone about [it]_p2096 last [Christmas]_n290 - had [Christmas]_n291 really come and gone already? - if this misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade [him]_p2092 from it. On hearing all this, [his]_p2098 sister would break out in tears of emotion, and [Gregor]_n292 would climb up to [her]_p2099 shoulder and kiss [her]_p2100 neck, which, since [she]_p2101 had been going out to work, [she]_p2102 had kept free without any necklace or collar. ""[Mr Samsa]_n293 !"", shouted the middle gentleman to [Gregor]_n294 's father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with [his]_p2103 forefinger at [Gregor]_n295 as [he]_p2104 slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at [his]_p2105 two friends, shaking [his]_p2106 head, and then looked back at [Gregor]_n296. [His]_p2107 father seemed to think [it]_p2108 more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving [Gregor]_n297 out, even though [they]_p2109 were not at all upset and seemed to think [Gregor]_n298 was more entertaining than the violin playing had been.",11,,53,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2110 rushed up to [them]_p2111 with [his]_p2113 arms spread out and attempted to drive [them]_p2112 back into [their]_p2115 room at the same time as trying to block [their]_p2116 view of [Gregor]_n299 with [his]_p2114 body. Now [they]_p2117 did become a little annoyed, and [it]_p2119 was not clear whether [it]_p2120 was [his]_p2122 father's behaviour that annoyed [them]_p2123 or the dawning realisation that [they]_p2118 had had a neighbour like [Gregor]_n300 in the next room without knowing it. [They]_p2124 asked [Gregor]_n301 's father for explanations, raised [their]_p2125 arms like [he]_p2128 had, tugged excitedly at [their]_p2126 beards and moved back towards [their]_p2126 room only very slowly. Meanwhile [Gregor]_n302 's sister had overcome the despair [she]_p2129 had fallen into when [her]_p2130 playing was suddenly interrupted. [She]_p2131 had let [her]_p2132 hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then [she]_p2135 suddenly pulled [herself]_p2137 together, lay the instrument on [her]_p2133 mother's lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where [she]_p2136 was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from [her]_p2133 father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward. Under [his]_p2138 sister's experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and [she]_p2139 had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room. [Gregor]_n303 's father seemed so obsessed with what [he]_p2140 was doing that [he]_p2141 forgot all the respect [he]_p2141 owed to [his]_p2143 tenants. [He]_p2144 urged [them]_p2145 and pressed [them]_p2146 until, when [he]_p2147 was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped [his]_p2148 foot and thereby brought [Gregor]_n304 's father to a halt. ""I declare here and now"", [he]_p2149 said, raising [his]_p2151 hand and glancing at [Gregor]_n305 's mother and sister to gain [their]_p2152 attention too, ""that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family"" - here [he]_p2150 looked briefly but decisively at the floor - ""I give immediate notice on [my]_p2153 room. For the days that [I]_p2154 have been living here [I]_p2155 will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary [I]_p2155 will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe [me]_p2157 [it]_p2158 would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.",7,,48,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" [He]_p2159 was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, [his]_p2160 two friends joined in with the words: ""And [we]_p2161 also give immediate notice. "" With that, [he]_p2162 took hold of the door handle and slammed the door. [Gregor]_n306 's father staggered back to [his]_p2163 seat, feeling [his]_p2164 way with [his]_p2164 hands, and fell into [it]_p2168 [it]_p2169 looked as if [he]_p2171 was stretching [himself]_p2173 out for [his]_p2165 usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way [his]_p2165 head kept nodding [it]_p2169 could be seen that [he]_p2172 was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, [Gregor]_n307 had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. [His]_p2174 disappointment at the failure of [his]_p2175 plan, and perhaps also because [he]_p2176 was weak from hunger, made [it]_p2177 impossible for [him]_p2178 to move. [He]_p2179 was sure that everyone would turn on [him]_p2180 any moment, and [he]_p2181 waited. [He]_p2182 was not even startled out of this state when the violin on [his]_p2183 mother's lap fell from [her]_p2184 trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor. ""[Father]_n308 , [Mother]_n309 "", said [his]_p2185 sister, hitting the table with [her]_p2186 hand as introduction, ""we can't carry on like this. Maybe [you]_p2187 can't see it, but [I]_p2188 can.",4,,30,
kafka_metamorphosis," [I]_p2189 don't want to call this monster [my]_p2191 brother, all [I]_p2190 can say is: [we]_p2192 have to try and get rid of it. We've done all that's humanly possible to look after [it]_p2193 and be patient, [I]_p2194 don't think anyone could accuse [us]_p2195 of doing anything wrong. "" ""She's absolutely right"", said [Gregor]_n310 's father to himself. [His]_p2196 mother, who still had not had time to catch [her]_p2197 breath, began to cough dully, [her]_p2198 hand held out in front of [her]_p2198 and a deranged expression in [her]_p2199 eyes. [Gregor]_n311 's sister rushed to [his]_p2201 mother and put [her]_p2202 hand on [her]_p2203 forehead. [Her]_p2204 words seemed to give [Gregor]_n312 's father some more definite ideas. [He]_p2205 sat upright, played with [his]_p2206 uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after [their]_p2207 meal, and occasionally looked down at [Gregor]_n313 as [he]_p2208 lay there immobile. ""We have to try and get rid of it"", said [Gregor]_n314 's sister, now speaking only to [her]_p2212 father, as [her]_p2213 mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, ""it'll be the death of both of you, [I]_p2214 can see [it]_p2209 coming. [We]_p2215 can't all work as hard as [we]_p2216 have to and then come home to be tortured like this, [we]_p2217 can't endure it. [I]_p2218 can't endure [it]_p2219 any more.",5,,29,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" And [she]_p2220 broke out so heavily in tears that [they]_p2222 flowed down the face of [her]_p2223 mother, and [she]_p2221 wiped [them]_p2224 away with mechanical hand movements. ""My child"", said [her]_p2225 father with sympathy and obvious understanding, ""what are [we]_p2229 to do?""  [His]_p2230 sister just shrugged [her]_p2226 shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing [her]_p2226 earlier certainty. ""If [he]_p2231 could just understand us"", said [his]_p2232 father almost as a question [his]_p2233 sister shook [her]_p2234 hand vigorously through [her]_p2235 tears as a sign that of that there was no question. ""If [he]_p2236 could just understand us"", repeated [Gregor]_n315 's father, closing [his]_p2237 eyes in acceptance of [his]_p2238 sister's certainty that that was quite impossible, ""then perhaps [we]_p2239 could come to some kind of arrangement with him. But as [it]_p2240 is. "" ""It's got to go"", shouted [his]_p2241 sister, ""that's the only way, [Father]_n316. You've got to get rid of the idea that that's [Gregor]_n317. We've only harmed [ourselves]_p2242 by believing [it]_p2243 for so long. How can that be [Gregor]_n318 ? If [it]_p2244 were [Gregor]_n319 [he]_p2246 would have seen long ago that it's not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and [he]_p2247 would have gone of [his]_p2248 own free will. [We]_p2249 wouldn't have a brother any more, then, but [we]_p2250 could carry on with [our]_p2251 lives and remember [him]_p2252 with respect.",5,,31,
kafka_metamorphosis," As [it]_p2253 is this animal is persecuting us, it's driven out [our]_p2258 tenants, [it]_p2254 obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force [us]_p2256 to sleep on the streets. [Father]_n320 , look, just look"", [she]_p2259 suddenly screamed, ""he's starting again!"" In [her]_p2261 alarm, which was totally beyond [Gregor]_n321 's comprehension, [his]_p2264 sister even abandoned [his]_p2265 mother as [she]_p2260 pushed [herself]_p2266 vigorously out of [her]_p2262 chair as if more willing to sacrifice [her]_p2262 own mother than stay anywhere near [Gregor]_n322. [She]_p2267 rushed over to behind [her]_p2268 father, who had become excited merely because [she]_p2270 was and stood up half raising [his]_p2271 hands in front of [Gregor]_n323 's sister as if to protect her. But [Gregor]_n324 had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all [his]_p2272 sister. All [he]_p2273 had done was begin to turn round so that [he]_p2274 could go back into [his]_p2276 room, although that was in [itself]_p2279 quite startling as [his]_p2277 pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and [he]_p2274 was using [his]_p2277 head to help [himself]_p2280 do it, repeatedly raising [it]_p2281 and striking [it]_p2282 against the floor. [He]_p2284 stopped and looked round. [They]_p2285 seemed to have realised [his]_p2286 good intention and had only been alarmed briefly. Now [they]_p2287 all looked at [him]_p2288 in unhappy silence. [His]_p2289 mother lay in [her]_p2290 chair with [her]_p2291 legs stretched out and pressed against each other, [her]_p2291 eyes nearly closed with exhaustion [his]_p2294 sister sat next to [his]_p2295 father with [her]_p2292 arms around [his]_p2295 neck. ""Maybe now they'll let [me]_p2297 turn round"", thought [Gregor]_n325 and went back to work.",6,,41,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2298 could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making [him]_p2299 rush any more, everything was left up to him. As soon as [he]_p2301 had finally finished turning round [he]_p2302 began to move straight ahead. [He]_p2303 was amazed at the great distance that separated [him]_p2304 from [his]_p2305 room, and could not understand how [he]_p2307 had covered that distance in [his]_p2306 weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it. [He]_p2308 concentrated on crawling as fast as [he]_p2309 could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from [his]_p2310 family to distract him. [He]_p2311 did not turn [his]_p2312 head until [he]_p2313 had reached the doorway. [He]_p2314 did not turn [it]_p2315 all the way round as [he]_p2317 felt [his]_p2318 neck becoming stiff, but [it]_p2316 was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind [him]_p2320 had changed, only [his]_p2319 sister had stood up. With [his]_p2321 last glance [he]_p2323 saw that [his]_p2322 mother had now fallen completely asleep. [He]_p2324 was hardly inside [his]_p2325 room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind [Gregor]_n326 so startled [him]_p2326 that [his]_p2328 little legs collapsed under him.",1,,29,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p2329 was [his]_p2330 sister who had been in so much of a rush. [She]_p2331 had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, [Gregor]_n327 had not heard [her]_p2332 coming at all, and as [she]_p2334 turned the key in the lock [she]_p2335 said loudly to [her]_p2333 parents ""At last!"". ""What now, then?"", [Gregor]_n328 asked [himself]_p2336 as [he]_p2337 looked round in the darkness. [He]_p2338 soon made the discovery that [he]_p2339 could no longer move at all. This was no surprise to him, [it]_p2340 seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. [He]_p2341 also felt relatively comfortable. [It]_p2342 is true that [his]_p2343 entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. [He]_p2344 could already hardly feel the decayed apple in [his]_p2345 back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust. [He]_p2346 thought back of [his]_p2347 family with emotion and love. If [it]_p2348 was possible, [he]_p2349 felt that [he]_p2350 must go away even more strongly than [his]_p2351 sister.",2,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2352 remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until [he]_p2353 heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. [He]_p2354 watched as [it]_p2355 slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. Then, without [his]_p2356 willing it, [his]_p2357 head sank down completely, and [his]_p2357 last breath flowed weakly from [his]_p2358 nostrils. When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked [her]_p2360 not to keep slamming the doors but with [her]_p2361 strength and in [her]_p2361 hurry [she]_p2364 still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd arrived and from then on [it]_p2367 was impossible to sleep in peace - [she]_p2365 made [her]_p2362 usual brief look in on [Gregor]_n329 and at first found nothing special. [She]_p2368 thought [he]_p2369 was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr [she]_p2370 attributed all possible understanding to him. [She]_p2371 happened to be holding the long broom in [her]_p2372 hand, so [she]_p2373 tried to tickle [Gregor]_n330 with [it]_p2374 from the doorway. When [she]_p2375 had no success with that [she]_p2376 tried to make a nuisance of [herself]_p2380 and poked at [him]_p2381 a little, and only when [she]_p2376 found [she]_p2377 could shove [him]_p2382 across the floor with no resistance at all did [she]_p2377 start to pay attention. [She]_p2383 soon realised what had really happened, opened [her]_p2384 eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: ""Come and 'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"" Mr and [Mrs Samsa]_n331 sat upright there in [their]_p2385 marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before [they]_p2386 could grasp what [she]_p2387 was saying. But then, each from [his]_p2388 own side, [they]_p2389 hurried out of bed. [Mr Samsa]_n332 threw the blanket over [his]_p2390 shoulders, [Mrs Samsa]_n333 just came out in [her]_p2391 nightdress and that is how [they]_p2392 went into [Gregor]_n334 's room.",6,,40,
kafka_metamorphosis," On the way [they]_p2393 opened the door to the living room where [Grete]_n335 had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in [she]_p2394 was fully dressed as if [she]_p2395 had never been asleep, and the paleness of [her]_p2396 face seemed to confirm this. ""[Dead]_n336 ?"", asked [Mrs Samsa]_n337 , looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though [she]_p2397 could have checked for [herself]_p2398 and could have known [it]_p2399 even without checking. ""That's what [I]_p2400 said"", replied the cleaner, and to prove [it]_p2401 [she]_p2403 gave [Gregor]_n338 's body another shove with the broom, sending [it]_p2402 sideways across the floor. [Mrs Samsa]_n339 made a movement as if [she]_p2404 wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. ""Now then"", said [Mr Samsa]_n340 , ""let's give thanks to God for that"". [He]_p2405 crossed himself, and the three women followed [his]_p2406 example. [Grete]_n341 , who had not taken [her]_p2407 eyes from the corpse, said: ""Just look how thin [he]_p2408 was. [He]_p2409 didn't eat anything for so long. The food came out again just the same as when [it]_p2410 went in"". [Gregor]_n342 's body was indeed completely dried up and flat, [they]_p2411 had not seen [it]_p2412 until then, but now [he]_p2413 was not lifted up on [his]_p2415 little legs, nor did [he]_p2414 do anything to make [them]_p2416 look away.",8,,24,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Grete]_n343 , come with [us]_p2417 in here for a little while"", said [Mrs Samsa]_n344 with a pained smile, and [Grete]_n345 followed [her]_p2418 parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although [it]_p2419 was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. [It]_p2421 was already the end of [March]_n346 , after all. The three gentlemen stepped out of [their]_p2422 room and looked round in amazement for [their]_p2423 breakfasts [they]_p2424 had been forgotten about. ""Where is [our]_p2425 breakfast?"", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. [She]_p2426 just put [her]_p2427 finger on [her]_p2428 lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that [they]_p2429 might like to come into [Gregor]_n347 's room. [They]_p2430 did so, and stood around [Gregor]_n348 's corpse with [their]_p2431 hands in the pockets of [their]_p2432 well-worn coats. [It]_p2433 was now quite light in the room. Then the door of the bedroom opened and [Mr Samsa]_n349 appeared in [his]_p2434 uniform with [his]_p2435 wife on one arm and [his]_p2435 daughter on the other.",7,,19,
kafka_metamorphosis," All of [them]_p2437 had been crying a little [Grete]_n350 now and then pressed [her]_p2438 face against [her]_p2439 father's arm. ""Leave [my]_p2440 home. Now!"", said [Mr Samsa]_n351 , indicating the door and without letting the women from him. ""What do [you]_p2441 mean?"", asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and [he]_p2442 smiled sweetly. The other two held [their]_p2443 hands behind [their]_p2444 backs and continually rubbed [them]_p2446 together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in [their]_p2444 favour. ""I mean just what [I]_p2447 said"", answered [Mr Samsa]_n352 , and, with [his]_p2449 two companions, went in a straight line towards the man. At first, [he]_p2450 stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of [his]_p2451 head were rearranging [themselves]_p2452 into new positions. ""[Alright]_n353 , we'll go then"", [he]_p2453 said, and looked up at [Mr Samsa]_n354 as if [he]_p2454 had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from [Mr Samsa]_n355 for [his]_p2455 decision. [Mr Samsa]_n356 merely opened [his]_p2456 eyes wide and briefly nodded to [him]_p2457 several times. At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway [his]_p2458 two friends had stopped rubbing [their]_p2459 hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said.",7,,22,
kafka_metamorphosis," Now [they]_p2460 jumped off after [their]_p2461 friend as if taken with a sudden fear that [Mr Samsa]_n357 might go into the hallway in front of [them]_p2463 and break the connection with [their]_p2462 leader. Once there, all three took [their]_p2464 hats from the stand, took [their]_p2465 sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the premises. [Mr Samsa]_n358 and the two women followed [them]_p2466 out onto the landing but [they]_p2467 had had no reason to mistrust the men's intentions and as [they]_p2468 leaned over the landing [they]_p2468 saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As [they]_p2470 turned the corner on each floor [they]_p2471 disappeared and would reappear a few moments later the further down [they]_p2471 went, the more that the [Samsa]_n359 family lost interest in [them]_p2474 when a butcher's boy, proud of posture with [his]_p2476 tray on [his]_p2477 head, passed [them]_p2475 on [his]_p2477 way up and came nearer than [they]_p2472 were, [Mr Samsa]_n360 and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat. [They]_p2479 decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk not only had [they]_p2480 earned a break from work but [they]_p2481 were in serious need of it. So [they]_p2482 sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal, [Mr Samsa]_n361 to [his]_p2483 employers, [Mrs Samsa]_n362 to [her]_p2484 contractor and [Grete]_n363 to [her]_p2485 principal. The cleaner came in while [they]_p2486 were writing to tell [them]_p2487 [she]_p2488 was going, she'd finished [her]_p2490 work for that morning. The three of [them]_p2491 at first just nodded without looking up from what [they]_p2492 were writing, and [it]_p2494 was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that [they]_p2493 looked up in irritation. ""Well?"", asked [Mr Samsa]_n364. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on [her]_p2495 face as if [she]_p2496 had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do [it]_p2498 if [she]_p2497 was clearly asked to.",8,,38,
kafka_metamorphosis," The almost vertical little ostrich feather on [her]_p2499 hat, which had been a source of irritation to [Mr Samsa]_n365 all the time [she]_p2500 had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. ""What is [it]_p2501 [you]_p2502 want then?"", asked [Mrs Samsa]_n366 , whom the cleaner had the most respect for. ""Yes"", [she]_p2503 answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made [her]_p2504 unable to speak straight away, ""well then, that thing in there, [you]_p2505 needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it. That's all been sorted out. "" [Mrs Samsa]_n367 and [Grete]_n368 bent down over [their]_p2507 letters as if intent on continuing with what [they]_p2508 were writing [Mr Samsa]_n369 saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, [he]_p2509 made [it]_p2510 quite clear that [she]_p2511 was not to. So, as [she]_p2512 was prevented from telling [them]_p2516 all about it, [she]_p2513 suddenly remembered what a hurry [she]_p2513 was in and, clearly peeved, called out ""[Cheerio]_n370 then, everyone"", turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as [she]_p2514 went. ""Tonight [she]_p2517 gets sacked"", said [Mr Samsa]_n371 , but [he]_p2518 received no reply from either [his]_p2519 wife or [his]_p2520 daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace [they]_p2521 had only just gained. [They]_p2522 got up and went over to the window where [they]_p2523 remained with [their]_p2524 arms around each other. [Mr Samsa]_n372 twisted round in [his]_p2525 chair to look at [them]_p2526 and sat there watching for a while. Then [he]_p2527 called out: ""Come here, then.",8,,28,
kafka_metamorphosis," Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give [me]_p2528 a bit of attention"". The two women immediately did as [he]_p2529 said, hurrying over to [him]_p2530 where [they]_p2533 kissed [him]_p2531 and hugged [him]_p2531 and then [they]_p2534 quickly finished [their]_p2535 letters. After that, the three of [them]_p2536 left the flat together, which was something [they]_p2537 had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. [They]_p2538 had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on [their]_p2539 seats, [they]_p2542 discussed [their]_p2540 prospects and found that on closer examination [they]_p2543 were not at all bad - until then [they]_p2543 had never asked each other about [their]_p2540 work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house what [they]_p2545 needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by [Gregor]_n373 , one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, [Grete]_n374 was becoming livelier. With all the worry [they]_p2546 had been having of late [her]_p2548 cheeks had become pale, but, while [they]_p2547 were talking, Mr and [Mrs Samsa]_n375 were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how [their]_p2549 daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady. [They]_p2550 became quieter.",3,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing [it]_p2551 [they]_p2553 agreed that [it]_p2552 would soon be time to find a good man for her. And, as if in confirmation of [their]_p2554 new dreams and good intentions, as soon as [they]_p2556 reached [their]_p2555 destination [Grete]_n376 was the first to get up and stretch out [her]_p2557 young body.",1,,7,
