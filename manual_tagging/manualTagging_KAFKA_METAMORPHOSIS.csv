kafka_metamorphosis,"[I]_p0 One morning, when [Gregor Samsa]_n0 woke from troubled dreams, [he]_p1 found [himself]_p2 transformed in [his]_p3 bed into a horrible vermin. [He]_p4 lay on [his]_p5 armour-like back, and if [he]_p8 lifted [his]_p6 head a little [he]_p9 could see [his]_p6 brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover [it]_p10 and seemed ready to slide off any moment. [His]_p11 many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as [he]_p12 looked. ""What's happened to me?"" [he]_p13 thought. [It]_p14 wasn't a dream. [His]_p15 room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between [its]_p16 four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - [Samsa]_n1 was a travelling salesman - and above [it]_p17 there hung a picture that [he]_p18 had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. [It]_p19 showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of [her]_p20 lower arm towards the viewer. [Gregor]_n2 then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.",3,,21,
kafka_metamorphosis," Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made [him]_p21 feel quite sad. ""How about if [I]_p22 sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense"", [he]_p23 thought, but that was something [he]_p24 was unable to do because [he]_p24 was used to sleeping on [his]_p26 right, and in [his]_p27 present state couldn't get into that position. However hard [he]_p28 threw [himself]_p31 onto [his]_p32 right, [he]_p29 always rolled back to where [he]_p29 was. [He]_p33 must have tried [it]_p34 a hundred times, shut [his]_p35 eyes so that [he]_p36 wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when [he]_p37 began to feel a mild, dull pain there that [he]_p37 had never felt before. ""Oh, God"", [he]_p39 thought, ""what a strenuous career [it]_p40 is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing [your]_p41 own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that [you]_p42 can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. [It]_p43 can all go to [Hell]_n3 !""[He]_p44 felt a slight itch up on [his]_p45 belly pushed [himself]_p49 slowly up on [his]_p46 back towards the headboard so that [he]_p50 could lift [his]_p46 head better found where the itch was, and saw that [it]_p56 was covered with lots of little white spots which [he]_p51 didn't know what to make of and when [he]_p51 tried to feel the place with one of [his]_p47 legs [he]_p52 drew [it]_p57 quickly back because as soon as [he]_p52 touched [it]_p57 [he]_p52 was overcome by a cold shudder. [He]_p59 slid back into [his]_p60 former position. ""Getting up early all the time"", [he]_p61 thought, ""[it]_p62 makes [you]_p63 stupid. You've got to get enough sleep.",1,,43,
kafka_metamorphosis," Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever [I]_p64 go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating [their]_p65 breakfasts. [I]_p66 ought to just try that with [my]_p68 boss I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If [I]_p69 didn't have [my]_p75 parents to think about I'd have given in [my]_p76 notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told [him]_p77 just what [I]_p70 think, tell [him]_p78 everything [I]_p70 would, let [him]_p78 know just what [I]_p71 feel. He'd fall right off [his]_p80 desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at [your]_p81 desk, talking down at [your]_p82 subordinates from up there, especially when [you]_p83 have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope once I've got the money together to pay off [my]_p87 parents' debt to [him]_p88 - another five or six years [I]_p84 suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, [my]_p89 train leaves at five. ""  And [he]_p90 looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.",0,,22,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""God in [Heaven]_n4 !""[he]_p91 thought. [It]_p92 was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, [it]_p93 was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? [He]_p94 could see from the bed that [it]_p95 had been set for four o'clock as [it]_p96 should have been [it]_p96 certainly must have rung. Yes, but was [it]_p98 possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, [he]_p99 had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should [he]_p100 do now? The next train went at seven if [he]_p101 were to catch that [he]_p101 would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and [he]_p102 did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if [he]_p104 did catch the train [he]_p105 would not avoid [his]_p107 boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, [he]_p105 would have put in [his]_p108 report about [Gregor]_n5 's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if [he]_p109 reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service [Gregor]_n6 had never once yet been ill. [His]_p110 boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse [his]_p111 parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would [he]_p112 have been entirely wrong in this case? [Gregor]_n7 did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.",4,,22,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p113 was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock at the door near [his]_p114 head. ""[Gregor]_n8"", somebody called - [it]_p115 was [his]_p117 mother -""it's quarter to seven. Didn't [you]_p118 want to go somewhere?""That gentle voice! [Gregor]_n9 was shocked when [he]_p119 heard [his]_p121 own voice answering, [it]_p122 could hardly be recognised as the voice [he]_p120 had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made [them]_p123 unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether [he]_p124 had heard properly or not. [Gregor]_n10 had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented [himself]_p125 with saying:""Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting up now. ""The change in [Gregor]_n11 's voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as [his]_p126 mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that [Gregor]_n12 , against [their]_p127 expectations was still at home, and soon [his]_p128 father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with [his]_p129 fist. ""[Gregor]_n13 , [Gregor]_n14"", [he]_p130 called,""what's wrong?""And after a short while [he]_p131 called again with a warning deepness in [his]_p132 voice[:""G][_n reg]_n15 or! Gregor!""At the other side door [his]_p133 sister came p[lainti]_n16 vely:""Gregor? Aren't [you]_p135 well? Do [you]_p13[6 need]_n17 anything?""Gregor answered to both sides:""I'm ready, now"", making an effort to remove all the strangeness from [his]_p133 voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. [His]_p137 father went back to [his]_p138 breakfast, but [his]_p139 sister whispered:""[Gregor]_n18 , open the door, [I]_p140 beg of you.",11,,27,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Gregor]_n19 , however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated [himself]_p141 for [his]_p142 cautious habit, acquired from [his]_p143 travelling, of locking all doors at night even when [he]_p144 was at home. The first thing [he]_p145 wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have [his]_p146 breakfast. Only then would [he]_p147 consider what to do next, as [he]_p148 was well aware that [he]_p148 would not bring [his]_p150 thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. [He]_p151 remembered that [he]_p152 had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and [he]_p153 wondered how [his]_p154 imaginings would slowly resolve [themselves]_p155 today. [He]_p156 did not have the slightest doubt that the change in [his]_p157 voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen. [It]_p158 was a simple matter to throw off the covers [he]_p159 only had to blow [himself]_p160 up a little and [they]_p161 fell off by themselves. But [it]_p162 became difficult after that, especially as [he]_p163 was so exceptionally broad. [He]_p164 would have used [his]_p165 arms and [his]_p166 hands to push [himself]_p167 up but instead of [them]_p168 [he]_p169 only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which [he]_p170 was moreover unable to control. If [he]_p171 wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch [itself]_p174 out and if [he]_p172 finally managed to do what [he]_p172 wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. ""This is something that can't be done in bed"", [Gregor]_n20 said to himself,""so don't keep trying to do [it]_p175"".",2,,35,
kafka_metamorphosis," The first thing [he]_p176 wanted to do was get the lower part of [his]_p182 body out of the bed, but [he]_p177 had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what [it]_p184 looked like [it]_p185 turned out to be too hard to move  [it]_p185 went so slowly and finally, almost in a frenzy, when [he]_p177 carelessly shoved [himself]_p187 forwards with all the force [he]_p178 could gather, [he]_p178 chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain [he]_p178 felt that the lower part of [his]_p183 body might well, at present, be the most sensitive. So then [he]_p188 tried to get the top part of [his]_p189 body out of the bed first, carefully turning [his]_p190 head to the side. This [he]_p191 managed quite easily, and despite [its]_p192 breadth and [its]_p193 weight, the bulk of [his]_p194 body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when [he]_p195 had at last got [his]_p198 head out of the bed and into the fresh air [it]_p200 occurred to [him]_p202 that if [he]_p196 let [himself]_p203 fall [it]_p201 would be a miracle if [his]_p199 head were not injured, so [he]_p196 became afraid to carry on pushing [himself]_p204 forward the same way. And [he]_p205 could not knock [himself]_p206 out now at any price better to stay in bed than lose consciousness. [It]_p207 took just as much effort to get back to where [he]_p208 had been earlier, but when [he]_p209 lay there sighing, and was once more watching [his]_p211 legs as [they]_p212 struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, [he]_p209 could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. [He]_p213 told [himself]_p214 once more that [it]_p215 was not possible for [him]_p217 to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of [it]_p216 in whatever way [he]_p218 could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time, though, [he]_p219 did not forget to remind [himself]_p220 that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this [he]_p221 would direct [his]_p223 eyes to the window and look out as clearly as [he]_p222 could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. ""Seven o'clock, already"", [he]_p224 said to [himself]_p225 when the clock struck again, ""seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like this.",0,,50,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" And [he]_p226 lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if [he]_p227 perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to [their]_p228 real and natural state. But then [he]_p229 said to himself: ""Before [it]_p230 strikes quarter past seven I'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to [me]_p231 as well, as [they]_p232 open up at work before seven o'clock. "" And so [he]_p233 set [himself]_p234 to the task of swinging the entire length of [his]_p235 body out of the bed all at the same time. If [he]_p236 succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept [his]_p239 head raised as [he]_p237 did so [he]_p237 could probably avoid injuring it. [His]_p240 back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to [it]_p241 falling onto the carpet. [His]_p242 main concern was for the loud noise [he]_p243 was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But [it]_p244 was something that had to be risked. When [Gregor]_n21 was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort, all [he]_p245 had to do was rock back and forth - [it]_p246 occurred to [him]_p247 how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him. Two strong people - [he]_p249 had [his]_p251 father and the maid in mind - would have been more than enough [they]_p253 would only have to push [their]_p254 arms under the dome of [his]_p252 back, peel [him]_p255 away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as [he]_p250 swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.",1,,29,
kafka_metamorphosis," Should [he]_p256 really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty [he]_p257 was in, [he]_p257 could not suppress a smile at this thought. After a while [he]_p259 had already moved so far across that [it]_p261 would have been hard for [him]_p262 to keep [his]_p263 balance if [he]_p260 rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and [he]_p264 would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. ""That'll be someone from work"", [he]_p265 said to himself, and froze very still, although [his]_p266 little legs only became all the more lively as [they]_p267 danced around. For a moment everything remained quiet. ""They're not opening the door"", [Gregor]_n22 said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. [Gregor]_n23 only needed to hear the visitor's first words of greeting and [he]_p268 knew who [it]_p269 was - the chief clerk himself. Why did [Gregor]_n24 have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where [they]_p270 immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of [them]_p272 who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that [he]_p274 couldn't get out of bed if [he]_p275 didn't spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was [it]_p277 really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were even necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did [they]_p271 have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made [him]_p281 upset than through any proper decision, [he]_p275 swang [himself]_p279 with all [his]_p282 force out of the bed.",3,,24,
kafka_metamorphosis," There was a loud thump, but [it]_p283 wasn't really a loud noise. [His]_p284 fall was softened a little by the carpet, and [Gregor]_n25 's back was also more elastic than [he]_p285 had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable. [He]_p286 had not held [his]_p287 head carefully enough, though, and hit [it]_p288 as [he]_p291 fell annoyed and in pain, [he]_p292 turned [it]_p289 and rubbed [it]_p289 against the carpet. ""[Something]_n26 's fallen down in there"", said the chief clerk in the room on the left. [Gregor]_n27 tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to [him]_p293 today could ever happen to the chief clerk too [you]_p294 had to concede that [it]_p295 was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in [his]_p296 highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on [his]_p297 right, [Gregor]_n28 's sister whispered to [him]_p298 to let [him]_p299 know:""[Gregor]_n29 , the chief clerk is here. """"Yes, [I]_p300 know"", said [Gregor]_n30 to [himself]_p301 but without daring to raise [his]_p302 voice loud enough for [his]_p303 sister to hear him. ""[Gregor]_n31"", said [his]_p304 father now from the room to [his]_p305 left,""the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why [you]_p306 didn't leave on the early train. [We]_p307 don't know what to say to him.",7,,25,
kafka_metamorphosis," And anyway, [he]_p308 wants to speak to [you]_p309 personally. So please open up this door. I'm sure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of [your]_p310 room. ""Then the chief clerk called""Good morning, [Mr Samsa]_n32"". ""[He]_p311 isn't well"", said [his]_p312 mother to the chief clerk, while [his]_p313 father continued to speak through the door. ""[He]_p314 isn't well, please believe me. Why else would [Gregor]_n33 have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. [It]_p315 nearly makes [me]_p316 cross the way [he]_p317 never goes out in the evenings he's been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening. [He]_p319 sits with [us]_p320 in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. [His]_p321 idea of relaxation is working with [his]_p322 fretsaw.",2,,14,
kafka_metamorphosis," He's made a little frame, for instance, [it]_p323 only took [him]_p327 two or three evenings, you'll be amazed how nice [it]_p324 is it's hanging up in [his]_p328 room you'll see [it]_p324 as soon as [Gregor]_n34 opens the door. Anyway, I'm glad you're here [we]_p329 wouldn't have been able to get [Gregor]_n35 to open the door by [ourselves]_p330 he's so stubborn and I'm sure [he]_p331 isn't well, [he]_p332 said this morning that [he]_p332 is, but [he]_p333 isn't. """"I'll be there in a moment"", said [Gregor]_n36 slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that [he]_p336 would not miss any word of the conversation. ""Well [I]_p337 can't think of any other way of explaining it, [Mrs Samsa]_n37"", said the chief clerk,""[I]_p338 hope it's nothing serious. But on the other hand, [I]_p339 must say that if [we]_p340 people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as [you]_p342 like, [we]_p341 simply have to overcome [it]_p343 because of business considerations. "" ""Can the chief clerk come in to see [you]_p344 now then?"", asked [his]_p345 father impatiently, knocking at the door again. ""No"", said [Gregor]_n38. In the room on [his]_p346 right there followed a painful silence in the room on [his]_p347 left [his]_p347 sister began to cry. So why did [his]_p349 sister not go and join the others? [She]_p350 had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was [she]_p351 crying? Was [it]_p352 because [he]_p353 had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because [he]_p354 was in danger of losing [his]_p355 job and if that happened [his]_p356 boss would once more pursue [their]_p357 parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that yet.",5,,33,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n39 was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning [his]_p358 family. For the time being [he]_p359 just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition [he]_p360 was in would seriously have expected [him]_p361 to let the chief clerk in. [It]_p362 was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for [it]_p363 later on, [it]_p364 was not something for which [Gregor]_n40 could be sacked on the spot. And [it]_p365 seemed to [Gregor]_n41 much more sensible to leave [him]_p366 now in peace instead of disturbing [him]_p367 with talking at [him]_p367 and crying. But the others didn't know what was happening, [they]_p369 were worried, that would excuse [their]_p370 behaviour. The chief clerk now raised [his]_p371 voice,""[Mr Samsa]_n42"", [he]_p372 called to him,""what is wrong? [You]_p373 barricade [yourself]_p374 in [your]_p375 room, give [us]_p378 no more than yes or no for an answer, [you]_p379 are causing serious and unnecessary concern to [your]_p376 parents and [you]_p380 fail - and [I]_p382 mention this just by the way - [you]_p380 fail to carry out [your]_p376 business duties in a way that is quite unheard of. I'm speaking here on behalf of [your]_p383 parents and of [your]_p384 employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. [I]_p385 am astonished, quite astonished. [I]_p386 thought [I]_p387 knew [you]_p388 as a calm and sensible person, and now [you]_p389 suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. This morning, [your]_p390 employer did suggest a possible reason for [your]_p391 failure to appear, it's true - [it]_p392 had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to [you]_p394 - but [I]_p395 came near to giving [him]_p396 [my]_p397 word of honour that that could not be the right explanation.",4,,39,
kafka_metamorphosis," But now that [I]_p398 see [your]_p400 incomprehensible stubbornness [I]_p399 no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on [your]_p401 behalf. And nor is [your]_p402 position all that secure. [I]_p403 had originally intended to say all this to [you]_p405 in private, but since [you]_p406 cause [me]_p407 to waste [my]_p408 time here for no good reason [I]_p404 don't see why [your]_p409 parents should not also learn of it. [Your]_p410 turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late [I]_p411 grant [you]_p412 that it's not the time of year to do especially good business, [we]_p413 recognise that but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, [Mr Samsa]_n43 , [we]_p414 cannot allow there to be. """"But Sir"", called [Gregor]_n44 , beside [himself]_p415 and forgetting all else in the excitement,""I'll open up immediately, just a moment. I'm slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, [I]_p416 haven't been able to get up. I'm still in bed now. I'm quite fresh again now, though. I'm just getting out of bed. Just a moment.",2,,19,
kafka_metamorphosis," Be patient! It's not quite as easy as I'd thought. I'm quite alright now, though. It's shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! [I]_p418 was quite alright last night, [my]_p420 parents know about it, perhaps better than me, [I]_p419 had a small symptom of [it]_p421 last night already. [They]_p423 must have noticed it. [I]_p424 don't know why [I]_p425 didn't let [you]_p426 know at work! But [you]_p427 always think [you]_p427 can get over an illness without staying at home. Please, don't make [my]_p429 parents suffer! There's no basis for any of the accusations you're making nobody's ever said a word to [me]_p430 about any of these things. Maybe [you]_p431 haven't read the latest contracts [I]_p432 sent in. I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given [me]_p433 strength. [You]_p434 don't need to wait, sir I'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend [me]_p435 to him!""And while [Gregor]_n45 gushed out these words, hardly knowing what [he]_p436 was saying, [he]_p437 made [his]_p440 way over to the chest of drawers - this was easily done, probably because of the practise [he]_p437 had already had in bed - where [he]_p438 now tried to get [himself]_p441 upright. [He]_p442 really did want to open the door, really did want to let [them]_p443 see [him]_p444 and to speak with the chief clerk the others were being so insistent, and [he]_p446 was curious to learn what [they]_p447 would say when [they]_p448 caught sight of him.",1,,29,
kafka_metamorphosis," If [they]_p449 were shocked then [it]_p450 would no longer be [Gregor]_n46 's responsibility and [he]_p451 could rest. If, however, [they]_p452 took everything calmly [he]_p453 would still have no reason to be upset, and if [he]_p454 hurried [he]_p454 really could be at the station for eight o'clock. The first few times [he]_p456 tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers [he]_p457 just slid down again, but [he]_p457 finally gave [himself]_p460 one last swing and stood there upright the lower part of [his]_p461 body was in serious pain but [he]_p458 no longer gave any attention to it. Now [he]_p462 let [himself]_p463 fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of [it]_p464 with [his]_p465 little legs. By now [he]_p466 had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that [he]_p467 could listen to what the chief clerk was saying. ""Did [you]_p468 understand a word of all that?"" the chief clerk asked [his]_p469 parents, ""surely he's not trying to make fools of [us]_p470"". ""Oh, God!"" called [his]_p471 mother, who was already in tears, ""[he]_p472 could be seriously ill and we're making [him]_p473 suffer. [Grete]_n47 ! [Grete]_n48 !""[she]_p474 then cried. ""[Mother]_n49 ?""[his]_p475 sister called from the other side. [They]_p476 communicated across [Gregor]_n50 's room.",5,,28,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""You'll have to go for the doctor straight away. [Gregor]_n51 is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did [you]_p477 hear the way [Gregor]_n52 spoke just now?""""That was the voice of an animal"", said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with [his]_p478 mother's screams. ""[Anna]_n53 ! [Anna]_n54 !""[his]_p479 father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping [his]_p480 hands,""get a locksmith here, now!""And the two girls, [their]_p481 skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as [they]_p482 went. How had [his]_p483 sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again [they]_p484 must have left [it]_p485 open people often do in homes where something awful has happened. [Gregor]_n55 , in contrast, had become much calmer. So [they]_p486 couldn't understand [his]_p488 words any more, although [they]_p487 seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before - perhaps [his]_p489 ears had become used to the sound. [They]_p490 had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first response to [his]_p491 situation had been confident and wise, and that made [him]_p492 feel better.",5,,16,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p493 felt that [he]_p494 had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith [he]_p495 expected great and surprising achievements - although [he]_p495 did not really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make [his]_p497 voice as clear as possible, [he]_p498 coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and [he]_p499 was no longer sure [he]_p499 could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, [it]_p501 had become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps [his]_p502 parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps [they]_p503 were all pressed against the door and listening. [Gregor]_n56 slowly pushed [his]_p504 way over to the door with the chair. Once there [he]_p505 let go of [it]_p506 and threw [himself]_p508 onto the door, holding [himself]_p509 upright against [it]_p507 using the adhesive on the tips of [his]_p510 legs. [He]_p511 rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set [himself]_p512 to the task of turning the key in the lock with [his]_p513 mouth. [He]_p514 seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw using the jaw, [he]_p515 really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that [he]_p516 must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from [his]_p518 mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. ""[Listen]_n57"", said the chief clerk in the next room,""he's turning the key. ""[Gregor]_n58 was greatly encouraged by this but [they]_p519 all should have been calling to him, [his]_p522 father and [his]_p523 mother too:""Well done, [Gregor]_n59"", [they]_p520 should have cried,""keep at it, keep hold of the lock!""And with the idea that [they]_p520 were all excitedly following [his]_p523 efforts, [he]_p526 bit on the key with all [his]_p524 strength, paying no attention to the pain [he]_p527 was causing himself.",4,,34,
kafka_metamorphosis," As the key turned round [he]_p528 turned around the lock with it, only holding [himself]_p531 upright with [his]_p532 mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed [it]_p529 down again with the whole weight of [his]_p533 body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as [it]_p534 snapped back was [Gregor]_n60 's sign that [he]_p535 could break [his]_p538 concentration, and as [he]_p536 regained [his]_p539 breath [he]_p536 said to himself:""So, [I]_p540 didn't need the locksmith after all"". Then [he]_p541 lay [his]_p542 head on the handle of the door to open [it]_p543 completely. Because [he]_p544 had to open the door in this way, [it]_p546 was already wide open before [he]_p545 could be seen. [He]_p547 had first to slowly turn [himself]_p548 around one of the double doors, and [he]_p549 had to do [it]_p551 very carefully if [he]_p550 did not want to fall flat on [his]_p552 back before entering the room. [He]_p553 was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when [he]_p554 heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud ""Oh!"", which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now [he]_p555 also saw [him]_p557 - [he]_p556 was the nearest to the door - [his]_p558 hand pressed against [his]_p559 open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. [Gregor]_n61 's mother, [her]_p560 hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked at [his]_p561 father. Then [she]_p562 unfolded [her]_p563 arms, took two steps forward towards [Gregor]_n62 and sank down onto the floor into [her]_p564 skirts that spread [themselves]_p568 out around [her]_p564 as [her]_p565 head disappeared down onto [her]_p565 breast. [His]_p569 father looked hostile, and clenched [his]_p570 fists as if wanting to knock [Gregor]_n63 back into [his]_p571 room.",4,,43,
kafka_metamorphosis," Then [he]_p572 looked uncertainly round the living room, covered [his]_p573 eyes with [his]_p574 hands and wept so that [his]_p574 powerful chest shook. So [Gregor]_n64 did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of [his]_p576 body could be seen, along with [his]_p577 head above [it]_p578 which [he]_p579 leant over to one side as [he]_p580 peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a hospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing [its]_p581 facade the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table there was so much of [it]_p582 because, for [Gregor]_n65 's father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and [he]_p584 would stretch [it]_p583 out for several hours as [he]_p585 sat reading a number of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of [Gregor]_n66 when [he]_p586 was a lieutenant in the army, [his]_p588 sword in [his]_p589 hand and a carefree smile on [his]_p589 face as [he]_p587 called forth respect for [his]_p590 uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open [he]_p592 could see onto the landing and the stairs where [they]_p593 began [their]_p594 way down below. ""Now, then"", said [Gregor]_n67 , well aware that [he]_p595 was the only one to have kept calm,""I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up [my]_p596 samples and set off. Will [you]_p597 please just let [me]_p598 leave? [You]_p599 can see"", [he]_p600 said to the chief clerk, ""that I'm not stubborn and [I]_p601 like to do [my]_p604 job being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling [I]_p602 couldn't earn [my]_p605 living. So where are [you]_p606 going, in to the office? Yes? Will [you]_p607 report everything accurately, then? It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that's just the right time to remember what's been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, [he]_p608 will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration.",4,,36,
kafka_metamorphosis," You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt to [our]_p612 employer as well as having to look after [my]_p613 parents and [my]_p614 sister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but [I]_p609 will work [my]_p614 way out of [it]_p616 again. Please don't make things any harder for [me]_p617 than [they]_p619 are already, and don't take sides against [me]_p618 at the office. [I]_p620 know that nobody likes the travellers. [They]_p621 think [we]_p622 earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That's just prejudice but [they]_p623 have no particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, [you]_p624 have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if [I]_p626 can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss [himself]_p627 - it's very easy for a businessman like [him]_p628 to make mistakes about [his]_p629 employees and judge [them]_p630 more harshly than [he]_p631 should. And you're also well aware that [we]_p632 travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that [we]_p633 can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it's almost impossible to defend [yourself]_p637 from that sort of thing, [we]_p633 don't usually even hear about them, or if at all it's when [we]_p634 arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when [we]_p634 feel the harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don't go away, at least first say something to show that [you]_p638 grant that I'm at least partly right!""But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as [Gregor]_n68 had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at [him]_p639 over [his]_p640 trembling shoulders as [he]_p641 left. [He]_p642 did not keep still for a moment while [Gregor]_n69 was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking [his]_p643 eyes off him. [He]_p644 moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.",2,,33,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p645 was only when [he]_p646 had reached the entrance hall that [he]_p647 made a sudden movement, drew [his]_p648 foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, [he]_p649 stretched [his]_p650 right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save him. [Gregor]_n70 realised that [it]_p651 was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if [his]_p652 position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. That was something [his]_p653 parents did not understand very well over the years, [they]_p655 had become convinced that this job would provide for [Gregor]_n71 for [his]_p654 entire life, and besides, [they]_p656 had so much to worry about at present that [they]_p656 had lost sight of any thought for the future. [Gregor]_n72 , though, did think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over the future of [Gregor]_n73 and [his]_p658 family depended on it! If only [his]_p659 sister were here! [She]_p661 was clever [she]_p662 was already in tears while [Gregor]_n74 was still lying peacefully on [his]_p659 back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely [she]_p663 could persuade [him]_p665  [she]_p664 would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk [him]_p666 out of [his]_p667 shocked state. But [his]_p668 sister was not there, [Gregor]_n75 would have to do the job himself. And without considering that [he]_p669 still was not familiar with how well [he]_p670 could move about in [his]_p673 present state, or that [his]_p674 speech still might not - or probably would not - be understood, [he]_p670 let go of the door pushed [himself]_p676 through the opening tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands but [Gregor]_n76 fell immediately over and, with a little scream as [he]_p671 sought something to hold onto, landed on [his]_p674 numerous little legs. Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, [he]_p677 began to feel alright with [his]_p681 body the little legs had the solid ground under [them]_p684 to [his]_p682 pleasure, [they]_p686 did exactly as [he]_p678 told [them]_p685 [they]_p687 were even making the effort to carry [him]_p688 where [he]_p678 wanted to go and [he]_p679 was soon believing that all [his]_p682 sorrows would soon be finally at an end.",7,,44,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p689 held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as [he]_p690 crouched there on the floor. [His]_p691 mother was not far away in front of [him]_p692 and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then [she]_p693 suddenly jumped up with [her]_p702 arms outstretched and [her]_p703 fingers spread shouting:""Help, for pity's sake, Help!""The way [she]_p694 held [her]_p703 head suggested [she]_p694 wanted to see [Gregor]_n77 better, but the unthinking way [she]_p695 was hurrying backwards showed that [she]_p695 did not [she]_p695 had forgotten that the table was behind [her]_p704 with all the breakfast things on [it]_p706 when [she]_p696 reached the table [she]_p696 sat quickly down on [it]_p707 without knowing what [she]_p696 was doing without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet. ""[Mother]_n78 , mother"", said [Gregor]_n79 gently, looking up at her. [He]_p708 had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help [himself]_p709 snapping in the air with [his]_p710 jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee. That set [his]_p711 mother screaming anew, [she]_p713 fled from the table and into the arms of [his]_p712 father as [he]_p714 rushed towards her. [Gregor]_n80 , though, had no time to spare for [his]_p715 parents now the chief clerk had already reached the stairs with [his]_p716 chin on the banister, [he]_p717 looked back for the last time. [Gregor]_n81 made a run for [him]_p718 [he]_p720 wanted to be sure of reaching [him]_p719 the chief clerk must have expected something, as [he]_p721 leapt down several steps at once and disappeared [his]_p722 shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put [Gregor]_n82 's father into a panic as well. Until then [he]_p723 had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding [Gregor]_n83 as [he]_p724 ran after him, [Gregor]_n84 's father seized the chief clerk's stick in [his]_p728 right hand (the chief clerk had left [it]_p733 behind on a chair, along with [his]_p729 hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with [his]_p729 left, and used [them]_p734 to d[rive G]_n85 regor back into [his]_p730 room, stamping [his]_p730 foot at [him]_p726 as [he]_p724 went. [Gregor]_n86 's appeals to [his]_p735 father were of no help, [his]_p736 appeals were simply not understood, however much [he]_p740 humbly turned [his]_p736 head [his]_p737 father merely stamped [his]_p737 foot all the harder.",10,,51,
kafka_metamorphosis," Across the room, despite the chilly weather, [Gregor]_n87 's mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of [it]_p741 and pressed [her]_p742 hands to [her]_p743 face. A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of [them]_p744 were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop [Gregor]_n88 's father as [he]_p745 drove [him]_p746 back, making hissing noises at [him]_p747 like a wild man. [Gregor]_n89 had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly. If [Gregor]_n90 had only been allowed to turn round [he]_p748 would have been back in [his]_p751 room straight away, but [he]_p749 was afraid that if [he]_p749 took the time to do that [his]_p752 father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal blow to [his]_p752 back or head from the stick in [his]_p753 father's hand any moment. Eventually, though, [Gregor]_n91 realised that [he]_p755 had no choice as [he]_p756 saw, to [his]_p759 disgust, that [he]_p756 was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line so [he]_p757 began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at [his]_p760 father, to turn [himself]_p761 round. [It]_p762 went very slowly, but perhaps [his]_p763 father was able to see [his]_p764 good intentions as [he]_p766 did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then [he]_p767 used the tip of [his]_p764 stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. If only [his]_p768 father would stop that unbearable hissing! [It]_p769 was making [Gregor]_n92 quite confused. When [he]_p770 had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, [he]_p771 made a mistake and turned [himself]_p773 back a little the way [he]_p771 had just come. [He]_p774 was pleased when [he]_p775 finally had [his]_p776 head in front of the doorway, but then saw that [it]_p778 was too narrow, and [his]_p777 body was too broad to get through [it]_p779 without further difficulty.",6,,39,
kafka_metamorphosis," In [his]_p780 present mood, [it]_p782 obviously did not occur to [his]_p781 father to open the other of the double doors so that [Gregor]_n93 would have enough space to get through. [He]_p783 was merely fixed on the idea that [Gregor]_n94 should be got back into [his]_p784 room as quickly as possible. Nor would [he]_p785 ever have allowed [Gregor]_n95 the time to get [himself]_p786 upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. What [he]_p787 did, making more noise than ever, was to drive [Gregor]_n96 forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way [it]_p788 sounded to [Gregor]_n97 as if there was now more than one father behind [him]_p790 [it]_p789 was not a pleasant experience,[ and G]_n98 regor pushed [himself]_p791 into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of [his]_p792 body lifted itself, [he]_p793 lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon [he]_p794 was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then [his]_p795 father gave [him]_p797 a hefty shove from behind which released [him]_p798 from where [he]_p800 was held and sent [him]_p798 flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into [his]_p796 room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet. II [It]_p801 was not until [it]_p802 was getting dark that evening that [Gregor]_n99 awoke from [his]_p803 deep and coma-like sleep. [He]_p804 would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if [he]_p805 hadn't been disturbed, as [he]_p806 had had enough sleep and felt fully rested. But [he]_p807 had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him.",7,,28,
kafka_metamorphosis," The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where [Gregor]_n100 was, [it]_p808 was dark. [He]_p809 pushed [himself]_p810 over to the door, feeling [his]_p811 way clumsily with [his]_p812 antennae - of which [he]_p813 was now beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been happening there. The whole of [his]_p814 left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and [he]_p816 limped badly on [his]_p815 two rows of legs. One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning - [it]_p817 was nearly a miracle that only one of [them]_p818 had been - and dragged along lifelessly. [It]_p819 was only when [he]_p820 had reached the door that [he]_p821 realised what [it]_p822 actually was that had drawn [him]_p825 over to [it]_p823 [it]_p824 was the smell of something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. [He]_p826 was so pleased [he]_p827 almost laughed, as [he]_p828 was even hungrier than [he]_p828 had been that morning, and immediately dipped [his]_p830 head into the milk, nearly covering [his]_p831 eyes with it. But [he]_p832 soon drew [his]_p834 head back again in disappointment not only did the pain in [his]_p835 tender left side make [it]_p837 difficult to eat the food - [he]_p833 was only able to eat if [his]_p835 whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the milk did not taste at all nice. Milk like this was normally [his]_p838 favourite drink, and [his]_p839 sister had certainly left [it]_p841 there for [him]_p842 because of that, but [he]_p843 turned, almost against [his]_p839 own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room. Through the crack in the door, [Gregor]_n101 could see that the gas had been lit in the living room.",2,,36,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p844 father at this time would normally be sat with [his]_p845 evening paper, reading [it]_p847 out in a loud voice to [Gregor]_n102 's mother, and sometimes to [his]_p846 sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. [Gregor]_n103 's sister would often write and tell [him]_p848 about this reading, but maybe [his]_p849 father had lost the habit in recent times. [It]_p850 was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat. ""What a quiet life [it]_p851 is the family lead"", said [Gregor]_n104 to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that [he]_p852 was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for [his]_p853 sister and parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that [Gregor]_n105 did not want to think about too much, so [he]_p854 started to move about, crawling up and down the room. Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again later on the door on the other side did the same [it]_p855 seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. [Gregor]_n106 went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who [it]_p857 was but the door was opened no more that night and [Gregor]_n107 waited in vain. The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that [he]_p858 had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides. [It]_p859 was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now [it]_p860 was easy to see that [his]_p861 parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as [they]_p862 all could be distinctly heard as [they]_p863 went away together on tip-toe. [It]_p864 was clear that no-one would come into [Gregor]_n108 's room any more until morning that gave [him]_p865 plenty of time to think undisturbed about how [he]_p866 would have to re-arrange [his]_p867 life.",7,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," For some reason, the tall, empty room where [he]_p868 was forced to remain made [him]_p871 feel uneasy as [he]_p869 lay there flat on the floor, even though [he]_p869 had been living in [it]_p872 for five years. Hardly aware of what [he]_p873 was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, [he]_p874 hurried under the couch. [It]_p875 pressed down on [his]_p876 back a little, and [he]_p880 was no longer able to lift [his]_p877 head, but [he]_p881 nonetheless felt immediately at ease and [his]_p877 only regret was that [his]_p878 body was too broad to get [it]_p882 all underneath. [He]_p883 spent the whole night there. Some of the time [he]_p884 passed in a light sleep, although [he]_p885 frequently woke from [it]_p889 in alarm because of [his]_p890 hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being [he]_p885 must remain calm, [he]_p886 must show patience and the greatest consideration so that [his]_p891 family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in [his]_p891 present condition, was forced to impose on them. [Gregor]_n109 soon had the opportunity to test the strength of [his]_p893 decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, [his]_p894 sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. [She]_p895 did not see [him]_p896 straight away, but when [she]_p898 did notice [him]_p897 under the couch - [he]_p901 had to be somewhere, for God's sake, [he]_p902 couldn't have flown away - [she]_p899 was so shocked that [she]_p899 lost control of [herself]_p903 and slammed the door shut again from outside. But [she]_p904 seemed to regret [her]_p906 behaviour, as [she]_p905 opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. [Gregor]_n110 had pushed [his]_p907 head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would [she]_p908 notice that [he]_p910 had left the milk as [it]_p913 was, realise that [it]_p914 was not from any lack of hunger and bring [him]_p917 in some other food that was more suitable? If [she]_p909 didn't do [it]_p914 [herself]_p918 [he]_p911 would rather go hungry than draw [her]_p919 attention to it, although [he]_p911 did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw [himself]_p921 at [his]_p922 sister's feet and beg [her]_p920 for something good to eat.",2,,53,
kafka_metamorphosis," However, [his]_p923 sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at [it]_p924 and the few drops of milk splashed around [it]_p925 with some surprise. [She]_p926 immediately picked [it]_p927 up - using a rag, not [her]_p929 bare hands - and carried [it]_p928 out. [Gregor]_n111 was extremely curious as to what [she]_p930 would bring in [its]_p931 place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but [he]_p932 never could have guessed what [his]_p933 sister, in [her]_p934 goodness, actually did bring. In order to test [his]_p935 taste, [she]_p936 brought [him]_p937 a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten vegetables bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard a few raisins and almonds some cheese that [Gregor]_n112 had declared inedible two days before a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. As well as all that [she]_p938 had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for [Gregor]_n113 's use, and placed [it]_p939 beside them. Then, out of consideration for [Gregor]_n114 's feelings, as [she]_p940 knew that [he]_p942 would not eat in front of her, [she]_p941 hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that [Gregor]_n115 would know [he]_p943 could make things as comfortable for [himself]_p945 as [he]_p943 liked. [Gregor]_n116 's little legs whirred, at last [he]_p946 could eat. What's more, [his]_p947 injuries must already have completely healed as [he]_p948 found no difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier [he]_p949 had cut [his]_p951 finger slightly with a knife, [he]_p950 thought of how [his]_p952 finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.",6,,30,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""Am [I]_p953 less sensitive than [I]_p954 used to be, then?"", [he]_p955 thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted [him]_p956 much more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another, [his]_p957 eyes watering with pleasure, [he]_p958 consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce the fresh foods, on the other hand, [he]_p959 didn't like at all, and even dragged the things [he]_p959 did want to eat a little way away from [them]_p962 because [he]_p960 couldn't stand the smell. Long after [he]_p963 had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, [his]_p965 sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to [him]_p966 that [he]_p964 should withdraw. [He]_p967 was immediately startled, although [he]_p968 had been half asleep, and [he]_p969 hurried back under the couch. But [he]_p970 needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that [his]_p972 sister was in the room, as eating so much food had rounded out [his]_p973 body a little and [he]_p971 could hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, [he]_p974 watched with bulging eyes as [his]_p976 sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing [them]_p977 in with the food [he]_p975 had not even touched at all as if [it]_p978 could not be used any more. [She]_p979 quickly dropped [it]_p980 all into a bin, closed [it]_p981 with [its]_p982 wooden lid, and carried everything out. [She]_p983 had hardly turned [her]_p984 back before [Gregor]_n117 came out again from under the couch and stretched himself. This was how [Gregor]_n118 received [his]_p985 food each day now, once in the morning while [his]_p986 parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten [their]_p988 meal at midday as [his]_p986 parents would sleep for a little while then as well, and [Gregor]_n119 's sister would send the maid away on some errand. [Gregor]_n120 's father and mother certainly did not want [him]_p989 to starve either, but perhaps [it]_p990 would have been more than [they]_p992 could stand to have any more experience of [his]_p994 feeding than being told about it, and perhaps [his]_p995 sister wanted to spare [them]_p996 what distress [she]_p997 could as [they]_p993 were indeed suffering enough.",4,,44,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p998 was impossible for [Gregor]_n121 to find out what [they]_p999 had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get [them]_p1000 out of the flat. As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even [his]_p1001 sister, thought that [he]_p1004 could understand them, so [he]_p1005 had to be content to hear [his]_p1002 sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as [she]_p1006 moved about [his]_p1002 room. [It]_p1007 was only later, when [she]_p1008 had become a little more used to everything - there was, of course, no question of [her]_p1009 ever becoming fully used to the situation - that [Gregor]_n122 would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly. ""He's enjoyed [his]_p1010 dinner today"", [she]_p1011 might say when [he]_p1013 had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if [he]_p1014 left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, [she]_p1012 would often say, sadly, ""now everything's just been left there again"". Although [Gregor]_n123 wasn't able to hear any news directly [he]_p1015 did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever [he]_p1016 heard anyone speaking [he]_p1016 would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press [his]_p1018 whole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about [him]_p1019 in some way, even if only in secret. For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what [they]_p1020 should do now but even between meals [they]_p1021 spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by [themselves]_p1022 and [it]_p1023 was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had fallen to [her]_p1024 knees and begged [Gregor]_n124 's mother to let [her]_p1025 go without delay. [It]_p1026 was not very clear how much [she]_p1027 knew of what had happened but [she]_p1028 left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking [Gregor]_n125 's mother for [her]_p1030 dismissal as if [she]_p1028 had done [her]_p1031 an enormous service. [She]_p1032 even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.",5,,35,
kafka_metamorphosis," Now [Gregor]_n126 's sister also had to help [his]_p1033 mother with the cooking although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. [Gregor]_n127 often heard how one of [them]_p1034 would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than""no thanks, I've had enough""or something similar. No-one drank very much either. [His]_p1035 sister would sometimes ask [his]_p1036 father whether [he]_p1037 would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch [it]_p1038 herself. When [his]_p1039 father then said nothing [she]_p1041 would add, so that [he]_p1043 would not feel selfish, that [she]_p1042 could send the housekeeper for it, but then [his]_p1040 father would close the matter with a big, loud ""No"", and no more would be said. Even before the first day had come to an end, [his]_p1044 father had explained to [Gregor]_n128 's mother and sister what [their]_p1045 finances and prospects were. Now and then [he]_p1046 stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box [he]_p1047 had saved from [his]_p1048 business when [it]_p1049 had collapsed five years earlier. [Gregor]_n129 heard how [he]_p1050 opened the complicated lock and then closed [it]_p1053 again after [he]_p1051 had taken the item [he]_p1051 wanted. What [he]_p1054 heard [his]_p1056 father say was some of the first good news that [Gregor]_n130 heard since [he]_p1055 had first been incarcerated in [his]_p1057 room. [He]_p1058 had thought that nothing at all remained from [his]_p1059 father's business, at least [he]_p1060 had never told [him]_p1061 anything different, and [Gregor]_n131 had never asked [him]_p1062 about [it]_p1063 anyway.",6,,31,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Their]_p1064 business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair, and [Gregor]_n132 's only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that [they]_p1065 could all forget about [it]_p1066 as quickly as possible. So then [he]_p1067 started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour that raised [him]_p1068 from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with [it]_p1069 the chance to earn money in quite different ways. [Gregor]_n133 converted [his]_p1070 success at work straight into cash that [he]_p1072 could lay on the table at home for the benefit of [his]_p1071 astonished and delighted family. [They]_p1073 had been good times and [they]_p1074 had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though [Gregor]_n134 had later earned so much that [he]_p1075 was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. [They]_p1076 had even got used to it, both [Gregor]_n135 and the family, [they]_p1077 took the money with gratitude and [he]_p1078 was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return. [Gregor]_n136 only remained close to [his]_p1079 sister now. Unlike him, [she]_p1080 was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, [it]_p1081 was [his]_p1083 secret plan to send [her]_p1084 to the conservatory next year even though [it]_p1082 would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way. During [Gregor]_n137 's short periods in town, conversation with [his]_p1085 sister would often turn to the conservatory but [it]_p1086 was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised. [Their]_p1087 parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but [Gregor]_n138 thought about [it]_p1088 quite hard and decided [he]_p1090 would let [them]_p1092 know what [he]_p1091 planned with a grand announcement of [it]_p1089 on [Christmas]_n139 day. That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through [his]_p1093 mind in [his]_p1094 present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.",8,,31,
kafka_metamorphosis," There were times when [he]_p1095 simply became too tired to continue listening, when [his]_p1098 head would fall wearily against the door and [he]_p1096 would pull [it]_p1099 up again with a start, as even the slightest noise [he]_p1096 caused would be heard next door and [they]_p1100 would all go silent. ""What's that he's doing now"", [his]_p1101 father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again. When explaining things, [his]_p1102 father repeated [himself]_p1103 several times, partly because [it]_p1105 was a long time since [he]_p1106 had been occupied with these matters [himself]_p1104 and partly because [Gregor]_n140 's mother did not understand everything the first time. From these repeated explanations [Gregor]_n141 learned, to [his]_p1107 pleasure, that despite all [their]_p1108 misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days. [It]_p1109 was not a lot, but [it]_p1110 had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated. Besides that, [they]_p1111 had not been using up all the money that [Gregor]_n142 had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, [Gregor]_n143 nodded with enthusiasm in [his]_p1112 pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution. [He]_p1113 could actually have used this surplus money to reduce [his]_p1114 father's debt to [his]_p1115 boss, and the day when [he]_p1117 could have freed [himself]_p1118 from that job would have come much closer, but now [it]_p1119 was certainly better the way [his]_p1115 father had done things. This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest [it]_p1120 was enough to maintain [them]_p1121 for, perhaps, one or two years, no more. That's to say, [it]_p1122 was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies  money to live on had to be earned.",4,,28,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1123 father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence. During the five years that [he]_p1124 had not been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success - [he]_p1125 had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would [Gregor]_n144 's elderly mother now have to go and earn money? [She]_p1126 suffered from asthma and [it]_p1127 was a strain for [her]_p1128 just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. Would [his]_p1129 sister have to go and earn money? [She]_p1130 was still a child of seventeen, [her]_p1131 life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin. Whenever [they]_p1132 began to talk of the need to earn money, [Gregor]_n145 would always first let go of the door and then throw [himself]_p1133 onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as [he]_p1134 became quite hot with shame and regret. [He]_p1135 would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or [he]_p1136 might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it. [He]_p1137 had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing [it]_p1138 now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what [he]_p1140 actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near [he]_p1141 had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now [he]_p1141 could not see [it]_p1139 at all, and if [he]_p1142 had not known that [he]_p1142 lived in [Charlottenstrasse]_n146 , which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, [he]_p1142 could have thought that [he]_p1143 was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. [His]_p1147 observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before [she]_p1148 would always push [it]_p1150 back to [its]_p1151 exact position by the window after [she]_p1149 had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on. If [Gregor]_n147 had only been able to speak to [his]_p1152 sister and thank [her]_p1153 for all that [she]_p1154 had to do for [him]_p1155 [it]_p1158 would have been easier for [him]_p1156 to bear [it]_p1159 but as [it]_p1159 was [it]_p1160 caused [him]_p1156 pain.",4,,39,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1162 sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer [it]_p1163 went on, of course, the better [she]_p1166 was able to do so, but as time went by [Gregor]_n148 was also able to see through [it]_p1164 all so much better. [It]_p1167 had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever [she]_p1168 entered the room. No sooner had [she]_p1169 come in than [she]_p1170 would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into [Gregor]_n149 's room, then [she]_p1170 would go straight to the window and pull [it]_p1173 hurriedly open almost as if [she]_p1171 were suffocating. Even if [it]_p1174 was cold, [she]_p1175 would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. [She]_p1176 would alarm [Gregor]_n150 twice a day with this running about and noise making [he]_p1177 would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that [she]_p1178 would certainly have liked to spare [him]_p1179 this ordeal, but [it]_p1181 was impossible for [her]_p1182 to be in the same room with [him]_p1180 with the windows closed. One day, about a month after [Gregor]_n151 's transformation when [his]_p1183 sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at [his]_p1184 appearance, [she]_p1185 came into the room a little earlier than usual and found [him]_p1186 still staring out the window, motionless, and just where [he]_p1187 would be most horrible. In itself, [his]_p1188 sister's not coming into the room would have been no surprise for [Gregor]_n152 as [it]_p1189 would have been difficult for [her]_p1190 to immediately open the window while [he]_p1194 was still there, but not only did [she]_p1196 not come in, [she]_p1197 went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought [he]_p1195 had threatened [her]_p1191 and tried to bite her. [Gregor]_n153 went straight to hide [himself]_p1198 under the couch, of course, but [he]_p1199 had to wait until midday before [his]_p1200 sister came back and [she]_p1201 seemed much more uneasy than usual. [It]_p1202 made [him]_p1203 realise that [she]_p1205 still found [his]_p1208 appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, [she]_p1206 probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when [she]_p1206 saw the little bit of [him]_p1204 that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to spare [her]_p1209 even this sight, [he]_p1210 spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on [his]_p1212 back and arranged [it]_p1214 so that [he]_p1211 was completely covered and [his]_p1213 sister would not be able to see [him]_p1215 even if [she]_p1216 bent down.",6,,52,
kafka_metamorphosis," If [she]_p1217 did not think this sheet was necessary then all [she]_p1218 had to do was take [it]_p1219 off again, as [it]_p1220 was clear enough that [it]_p1220 was no pleasure for [Gregor]_n154 to cut [himself]_p1222 off so completely. [She]_p1223 left the sheet where [it]_p1224 was. [Gregor]_n155 even thought [he]_p1225 glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when [he]_p1226 carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how [his]_p1227 sister liked the new arrangement. For the first fourteen days, [Gregor]_n156 's parents could not bring [themselves]_p1228 to come into the room to see him. [He]_p1229 would often hear [them]_p1230 say how [they]_p1231 appreciated all the new work [his]_p1233 sister was doing even though, before, [they]_p1232 had seen [her]_p1234 as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of [Gregor]_n157 's room while [his]_p1238 sister tidied up in there, and as soon as [she]_p1239 went out again [she]_p1240 would have to tell [them]_p1236 exactly how everything looked, what [Gregor]_n158 had eaten, how [he]_p1241 had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. [His]_p1242 mother also wanted to go in and visit [Gregor]_n159 relatively soon but [his]_p1243 father and sister at first persuaded [her]_p1244 against it. [Gregor]_n160 listened very closely to all this, and approved fully. Later, though, [she]_p1245 had to be held back by force, which made [her]_p1248 call out:""Let [me]_p1250 go and see [Gregor]_n161 , [he]_p1251 is [my]_p1252 unfortunate son! Can't [you]_p1253 understand [I]_p1254 have to see him?"", and [Gregor]_n162 would think to [himself]_p1255 that maybe [it]_p1256 would be better if [his]_p1257 mother came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps [she]_p1246 could understand everything much better than [his]_p1258 sister who, for all [her]_p1249 courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult's appreciation of the burdensome job [she]_p1246 had taken on. [Gregor]_n163 's wish to see [his]_p1259 mother was soon realised.",10,,41,
kafka_metamorphosis," Out of consideration for [his]_p1260 parents, [Gregor]_n164 wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give [him]_p1262 much room to crawl about, [it]_p1264 was hard to just lie quietly through the night, [his]_p1261 food soon stopped giving [him]_p1263 any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, [he]_p1265 got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling. [He]_p1266 was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling [it]_p1267 was quite different from lying on the floor [he]_p1270 could breathe more freely [his]_p1272 body had a light swing to [it]_p1268 and up there, relaxed and almost happy, [it]_p1268 might happen that [he]_p1271 would surprise even [himself]_p1273 by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of course, [he]_p1274 had far better control of [his]_p1275 body than before and, even with a fall as great as that, caused [himself]_p1276 no damage. Very soon [his]_p1277 sister noticed [Gregor]_n165 's new way of entertaining [himself]_p1280 - [he]_p1281 had, after all, left traces of the adhesive from [his]_p1278 feet as [he]_p1282 crawled about - and got [it]_p1283 into [her]_p1285 head to make [it]_p1284 as easy as possible for [him]_p1286 by removing the furniture that got in [his]_p1278 way, especially the chest of drawers and the desk. Now, this was not something that [she]_p1287 would be able to do by [herself]_p1291 [she]_p1288 did not dare to ask for help from [her]_p1292 father the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but [she]_p1288 certainly would not have helped in this, [she]_p1289 had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless [it]_p1294 was especially important so [his]_p1295 sister had no choice but to choose some time when [Gregor]_n166 's father was not there and fetch [his]_p1296 mother to help her. As [she]_p1297 approached the room, [Gregor]_n167 could hear [his]_p1299 mother express [her]_p1300 joy, but once at the door [she]_p1298 went silent. First, of course, [his]_p1301 sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright and only then did [she]_p1302 let [her]_p1303 mother enter. [Gregor]_n168 had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into [it]_p1304 so that everything really looked as if [it]_p1305 had just been thrown down by chance. [Gregor]_n169 also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet [he]_p1306 gave up the chance to see [his]_p1307 mother until later and was simply glad that [she]_p1308 had come. ""[You]_p1309 can come in, [he]_p1310 can't be seen"", said [his]_p1311 sister, obviously leading [her]_p1312 in by the hand.",6,,52,
kafka_metamorphosis," The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but [Gregor]_n170 listened as [they]_p1313 pushed [it]_p1314 from [its]_p1315 place, [his]_p1316 sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for [herself]_p1317 and ignoring [her]_p1319 mother's warnings that [she]_p1320 would strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at [it]_p1321 for fifteen minutes or more [his]_p1328 mother said [it]_p1322 would be better to leave the chest where [it]_p1322 was, for one thing [it]_p1323 was too heavy for [them]_p1330 to get the job finished before [Gregor]_n171 's father got home and leaving [it]_p1323 in the middle of the room [it]_p1323 would be in [his]_p1329 way even more, and for another thing [it]_p1324 wasn't even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. [She]_p1331 thought just the opposite the sight of the bare walls saddened [her]_p1332 right to [her]_p1333 heart and why wouldn't [Gregor]_n172 feel the same way about it, he'd been used to this furniture in [his]_p1336 room for a long time and [it]_p1334 would make [him]_p1337 feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting [Gregor]_n173 (whose whereabouts [she]_p1338 did not know) to hear not even the tone of [her]_p1341 voice, as [she]_p1339 was convinced that [he]_p1343 did not understand [her]_p1342 words, [she]_p1339 added""and by taking the furniture away, won't [it]_p1346 seem like we're showing that we've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning [him]_p1349 to cope for himself? [I]_p1350 think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the way [it]_p1347 was before so that when [Gregor]_n174 comes back to [us]_p1351 again he'll find everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in between all the easier"". Hearing these words from [his]_p1352 mother made [Gregor]_n175 realise that the lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made [him]_p1354 confused - [he]_p1355 could think of no other way of explaining to [himself]_p1357 why [he]_p1356 had seriously wanted [his]_p1353 room emptied out. Had [he]_p1358 really wanted to transform [his]_p1361 room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture [he]_p1359 had inherited? That would have let [him]_p1363 crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but [it]_p1365 would also have let [him]_p1364 quickly forget [his]_p1362 past when [he]_p1359 had still been human. [He]_p1366 had come very close to forgetting, and [it]_p1367 had only been the voice of [his]_p1369 mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken [him]_p1370 out of it. Nothing should be removed everything had to stay [he]_p1371 could not do without the good influence the furniture had on [his]_p1372 condition and if the furniture made [it]_p1373 difficult for [him]_p1374 to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage. [His]_p1375 sister, unfortunately, did not agree [she]_p1376 had become used to the idea, not without reason, that [she]_p1377 was [Gregor]_n176 's spokesman to [his]_p1378 parents about the things that concerned him.",7,,60,
kafka_metamorphosis," This meant that [his]_p1379 mother's advice now was sufficient reason for [her]_p1380 to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as [she]_p1381 had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. [It]_p1382 was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence [she]_p1383 had recently acquired, that made [her]_p1385 insist [she]_p1384 had indeed noticed that [Gregor]_n177 needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to [him]_p1386 at all. Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel [they]_p1387 must get [their]_p1389 way whenever [they]_p1388 can. Perhaps this was what tempted [Grete]_n178 to make [Gregor]_n179 's situation seem even more shocking than [it]_p1390 was so that [she]_p1391 could do even more for him. [Grete]_n180 would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by [Gregor]_n181 crawling about the bare walls by himself. So [she]_p1392 refused to let [her]_p1393 mother dissuade her. [Gregor]_n182 's mother already looked uneasy in [his]_p1395 room, [she]_p1396 soon stopped speaking and helped [Gregor]_n183 's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength [she]_p1397 had. The chest of drawers was something that [Gregor]_n184 could do without if [he]_p1398 had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than [Gregor]_n185 poked [his]_p1399 head out from under the couch to see what [he]_p1400 could do about it. [He]_p1401 meant to be as careful and considerate as [he]_p1402 could, but, unfortunately, [it]_p1403 was [his]_p1406 mother who came back first while [Grete]_n186 in the next room had [her]_p1407 arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at [it]_p1404 from side to side by [herself]_p1408 without, of course, moving [it]_p1404 an inch.",10,,29,
kafka_metamorphosis," [His]_p1409 mother was not used to the sight of [Gregor]_n187 , [he]_p1410 might have made [her]_p1411 ill, so [Gregor]_n188 hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In [his]_p1412 startlement, though, [he]_p1413 was not able to prevent the sheet at [its]_p1414 front from moving a little. [It]_p1415 was enough to attract [his]_p1416 mother's attention. [She]_p1417 stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to [Grete]_n189. [Gregor]_n190 kept trying to assure [himself]_p1418 that nothing unusual was happening, [it]_p1419 was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but [he]_p1420 soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, [their]_p1422 little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made [him]_p1423 feel as if [he]_p1421 were being assailed from all sides. With [his]_p1424 head and legs pulled in against [him]_p1426 and [his]_p1425 body pressed to the floor, [he]_p1427 was forced to admit to [himself]_p1429 that [he]_p1428 could not stand all of this much longer. [They]_p1430 were emptying [his]_p1431 room out taking away everything that was dear to [him]_p1434 [they]_p1435 had already taken out the chest containing [his]_p1432 fretsaw and other tools  now [they]_p1436 threatened to remove the writing desk with [its]_p1437 place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where [he]_p1438 had done [his]_p1432 homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while [he]_p1439 had been at infant school, [he]_p1439 really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women's intentions were good. [He]_p1441 had nearly forgotten [they]_p1442 were there anyway, as [they]_p1443 were now too tired to say anything while [they]_p1443 worked and [he]_p1446 could only hear [their]_p1447 feet as [they]_p1444 stepped heavily on the floor. So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching [their]_p1448 breath, [he]_p1449 sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what [he]_p1450 should save first before [his]_p1451 attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was already denuded of everything else that had been on [it]_p1452 - of the lady dressed in copious fur. [He]_p1453 hurried up onto the picture and pressed [himself]_p1454 against [its]_p1455 glass, [it]_p1456 held [him]_p1457 firmly and felt good on [his]_p1458 hot belly.",4,,50,
kafka_metamorphosis," This picture at least, now totally covered by [Gregor]_n191 , would certainly be taken away by no-one. [He]_p1459 turned [his]_p1460 head to face the door into the living room so that [he]_p1461 could watch the women when [they]_p1462 came back. [They]_p1463 had not allowed [themselves]_p1464 a long rest and came back quite soon [Grete]_n192 had put [her]_p1465 arm around [her]_p1466 mother and was nearly carrying her. ""What shall [we]_p1468 take now, then?"", said [Grete]_n193 and looked around. [Her]_p1469 eyes met those of [Gregor]_n194 on the wall. Perhaps only because [her]_p1470 mother was there, [she]_p1475 remained calm, bent [her]_p1471 face to [her]_p1471 so that [she]_p1476 would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in [her]_p1472 voice:""Come on, let's go back in the living room for a while?""[Gregor]_n195 could see what [Grete]_n196 had in mind, [she]_p1476 wanted to take [her]_p1472 mother somewhere safe and then chase [him]_p1478 down from the wall. Well, [she]_p1479 could certainly try it! [He]_p1480 sat unyielding on [his]_p1481 picture. [He]_p1482 would rather jump at [Grete]_n197 's face. But [Grete]_n198 's words had made [her]_p1483 mother quite worried, [she]_p1484 stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before [she]_p1485 even realised [it]_p1489 was [Gregor]_n199 that [she]_p1485 saw screamed:""Oh God, oh God!""Arms outstretched, [she]_p1486 fell onto the couch as if [she]_p1486 had given up everything and stayed there immobile. ""[Gregor]_n200 !""shouted [his]_p1490 sister, glowering at [him]_p1491 and shaking [her]_p1492 fist.",10,,33,
kafka_metamorphosis," That was the first word [she]_p1493 had spoken to [him]_p1494 directly since [his]_p1495 transformation. [She]_p1496 ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring [her]_p1497 mother out of [her]_p1498 faint [Gregor]_n201 wanted to help too - [he]_p1503 could save [his]_p1509 picture later, although [he]_p1504 stuck fast to the glass and had to pull [himself]_p1511 off by force then he, too, ran into the next room as if [he]_p1504 could advise [his]_p1510 sister like in the old days but [he]_p1505 had to just stand behind [her]_p1498 doing nothing [she]_p1512 was looking into various bottles, [he]_p1505 startled [her]_p1499 when [she]_p1513 turned round a bottle fell to the ground and broke a splinter cut [Gregor]_n202 's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over [him]_p1516 now, without delaying any longer, [Grete]_n203 took hold of all the bottles [she]_p1513 could and ran with [them]_p1517 in to [her]_p1499 mother [she]_p1514 slammed the door shut with [her]_p1499 foot. So now [Gregor]_n204 was shut out from [his]_p1518 mother, who, because of him, might be near to death [he]_p1525 could not open the door if [he]_p1526 did not want to chase [his]_p1519 sister away, and [she]_p1530 had to stay with [his]_p1519 mother there was nothing for [him]_p1522 to do but wait and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, [he]_p1526 began to crawl about, [he]_p1527 crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in [his]_p1520 confusion as the whole room began to spin around [him]_p1523 [he]_p1527 fell down into the middle of the dinner table. [He]_p1531 lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around [him]_p1532 [it]_p1533 was quiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door. The maid, of course, had locked [herself]_p1534 in [her]_p1535 kitchen so that [Grete]_n205 would have to go and answer it. [His]_p1536 father had arrived home. ""What's happened?""were [his]_p1537 first words [Grete]_n206 's appearance must have made everything clear to him. [She]_p1538 answered [him]_p1539 with subdued voice, and openly pressed [her]_p1540 face into [his]_p1541 chest:""[Mother]_n207 's fainted, but she's better now. [Gregor]_n208 got out.",8,,47,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" ""Just as [I]_p1542 expected"", said [his]_p1544 father, ""just as [I]_p1543 always said, but [you]_p1545 women wouldn't listen, would you. ""[It]_p1547 was clear to [Gregor]_n209 that [Grete]_n210 had not said enough and that [his]_p1548 father took [it]_p1549 to mean that something bad had happened, that [he]_p1550 was responsible for some act of violence. That meant [Gregor]_n211 would now have to try to calm [his]_p1551 father, as [he]_p1552 did not have the time to explain things to [him]_p1553 even if that had been possible. So [he]_p1554 fled to the door of [his]_p1557 room and pressed [himself]_p1560 against [it]_p1561 so that [his]_p1558 father, when [he]_p1555 came in from the hall, could see straight away that [Gregor]_n212 had the best intentions and would go back into [his]_p1558 room without delay, that [it]_p1562 would not be necessary to drive [him]_p1563 back but that [they]_p1564 had only to open the door and [he]_p1555 would disappear. [His]_p1565 father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that ""Ah!"", [he]_p1566 shouted as [he]_p1567 came in, sounding as if [he]_p1567 were both angry and glad at the same time. [Gregor]_n213 drew [his]_p1569 head back from the door and lifted [it]_p1571 towards [his]_p1570 father. [He]_p1572 really had not imagined [his]_p1573 father the way [he]_p1575 stood there now of late, with [his]_p1574 new habit of crawling about, [he]_p1576 had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way [he]_p1576 had done before. [He]_p1578 really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really [his]_p1579 father? The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in [his]_p1580 bed when [Gregor]_n214 came back from [his]_p1580 business trips, who would receive [him]_p1591 sitting in the armchair in [his]_p1581 nightgown when [he]_p1593 came back in the evenings who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of [his]_p1581 pleasure, would just raise [his]_p1581 arms and who, on the couple of times a year when [they]_p1595 went for a walk together on a [Sunday]_n215 or public holiday wrapped up tightly in [his]_p1582 overcoat between [Gregor]_n216 and [his]_p1582 mother, would always labour [his]_p1582 way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for [his]_p1582 sake who would place [his]_p1583 stick down carefully and, if [he]_p1594 wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather [his]_p1583 companions around him. [He]_p1596 was standing up straight enough now  dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute above the high, stiff collar of the coat [his]_p1597 strong double-chin emerged under the bushy eyebrows, [his]_p1598 piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert [his]_p1598 normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to [his]_p1599 scalp. [He]_p1601 took [his]_p1602 cap, with [its]_p1606 gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw [it]_p1607 in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put [his]_p1603 hands in [his]_p1603 trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of [his]_p1604 long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards [Gregor]_n217.",9,,64,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p1608 probably did not even know [himself]_p1609 what [he]_p1610 had in mind, but nonetheless lifted [his]_p1611 feet unusually high. [Gregor]_n218 was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of [his]_p1612 boots, but wasted no time with that - [he]_p1615 knew full well, right from the first day of [his]_p1613 new life, that [his]_p1613 father thought [it]_p1616 necessary to always be extremely strict with him. And so [he]_p1617 ran up to [his]_p1619 father, stopped when [his]_p1620 father stopped, scurried forwards again when [he]_p1618 moved, even slightly. In this way [they]_p1621 went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly. [Gregor]_n219 remained all this time on the floor, largely because [he]_p1622 feared [his]_p1624 father might see [it]_p1625 as especially provoking if [he]_p1623 fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever [he]_p1626 did, [Gregor]_n220 had to admit that [he]_p1627 certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step [his]_p1629 father took [he]_p1627 had to carry out countless movements. [He]_p1630 became noticeably short of breath, even in [his]_p1631 earlier life [his]_p1632 lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as [he]_p1633 lurched about in [his]_p1637 efforts to muster all the strength [he]_p1634 could for running [he]_p1634 could hardly keep [his]_p1638 eyes open [his]_p1638 thoughts became too slow for [him]_p1640 to think of any other way of saving [himself]_p1644 than running [he]_p1635 almost forgot that the walls were there for [him]_p1641 to use although, here, [they]_p1645 were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and rolled in front of him. [It]_p1646 was an apple then another one immediately flew at [him]_p1647 [Gregor]_n221 froze in shock there was no longer any point in running as [his]_p1649 father had decided to bombard him. [He]_p1650 had filled [his]_p1651 pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another.",4,,41,
kafka_metamorphosis," These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if [they]_p1652 had electric motors. An apple thrown without much force glanced against [Gregor]_n222 's back and slid off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in [his]_p1653 back [Gregor]_n223 wanted to drag [himself]_p1656 away, as if [he]_p1658 could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing [his]_p1654 position but [he]_p1659 felt as if nailed to the spot and spread [himself]_p1657 out, all [his]_p1654 senses in confusion. The last thing [he]_p1660 saw was the door of [his]_p1661 room being pulled open, [his]_p1662 sister was screaming, [his]_p1662 mother ran out in front of [her]_p1669 in [her]_p1670 blouse (as [his]_p1663 sister had taken off some of [her]_p1670 clothes after [she]_p1676 had fainted to make [it]_p1679 easier for [her]_p1671 to breathe), [she]_p1677 ran to [his]_p1663 father, [her]_p1671 skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts [she]_p1677 pushed [herself]_p1680 to [his]_p1663 father, [her]_p1671 arms around him, uniting [herself]_p1681 with [him]_p1682 totally - now [Gregor]_n224 lost [his]_p1664 ability to see anything - [her]_p1672 hands behind [his]_p1664 father's head begging [him]_p1683 to spare [Gregor]_n225 's life. III No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in [Gregor]_n226 's flesh, so [it]_p1685 remained there as a visible reminder of [his]_p1686 injury. [He]_p1687 had suffered [it]_p1688 there for more than a month, and [his]_p1689 condition seemed serious enough to remind even [his]_p1690 father that [Gregor]_n227 , despite [his]_p1690 current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for [him]_p1692 and to be patient, just to be patient. Because of [his]_p1693 injuries, [Gregor]_n228 had lost much of [his]_p1694 mobility - probably permanently. [He]_p1695 had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and [it]_p1696 took [him]_p1697 long, long minutes to crawl across [his]_p1698 room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but this deterioration in [his]_p1699 condition was fully (in [his]_p1699 opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening. [He]_p1701 got into the habit of closely watching [it]_p1702 for one or two hours before [it]_p1703 was opened and then, lying in the darkness of [his]_p1704 room where [he]_p1705 could not be seen from the living room, [he]_p1706 could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to [their]_p1707 conversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before.",7,,55,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p1708 no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, the ones that [Gregor]_n229 always thought about with longing when [he]_p1709 was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All of [them]_p1710 were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, [his]_p1711 father would go to sleep in [his]_p1712 chair [his]_p1712 mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet [his]_p1713 mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop [his]_p1713 sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that [she]_p1716 might be able to get a better position later on. Sometimes [his]_p1717 father would wake up and say to [Gregor]_n230 's mother""you're doing so much sewing again today!"", as if [he]_p1718 did not know that [he]_p1719 had been dozing - and then [he]_p1719 would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin. With a kind of stubbornness, [Gregor]_n231 's father refused to take [his]_p1721 uniform off even at home while [his]_p1722 nightgown hung unused on [its]_p1724 peg [Gregor]_n232 's father would slumber where [he]_p1725 was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of [his]_p1722 superior even here. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this [it]_p1726 slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of [Gregor]_n233 's mother and sister to look after it. [Gregor]_n234 would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with [its]_p1728 gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in [it]_p1729 would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful. As soon as [it]_p1730 struck ten, [Gregor]_n235 's mother would speak gently to [his]_p1731 father to wake [him]_p1733 and try to persuade [him]_p1734 to go to bed, as [he]_p1735 couldn't sleep properly where [he]_p1736 was and [he]_p1736 really had to get [his]_p1732 sleep if [he]_p1737 was to be up at six to get to work. But since [he]_p1739 had been in work [he]_p1740 had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though [he]_p1740 regularly fell asleep and [it]_p1742 was then harder than ever to persuade [him]_p1743 to exchange the chair for [his]_p1744 bed. Then, however much mother and sister would importune [him]_p1745 with little reproaches and warnings [he]_p1746 would keep slowly shaking [his]_p1747 head for a quarter of an hour with [his]_p1748 eyes closed and refusing to get up.",7,,40,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n236 's mother would tug at [his]_p1749 sleeve, whisper endearments into [his]_p1750 ear, [Gregor]_n237 's sister would leave [her]_p1751 work to help [her]_p1752 mother, but nothing would have any effect on him. [He]_p1753 would just sink deeper into [his]_p1754 chair. Only when the two women took [him]_p1755 under the arms [he]_p1758 would abruptly open [his]_p1761 eyes, look at [them]_p1764 one after the other and say:""What a life! This is what peace [I]_p1766 get in [my]_p1767 old age!""And supported by the two women [he]_p1759 would lift [himself]_p1768 up carefully as if [he]_p1759 were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take [him]_p1756 to the door, send [them]_p1765 off and carry on by [himself]_p1769 while [Gregor]_n238 's mother would throw down [her]_p1771 needle and [his]_p1762 sister [her]_p1772 pen so that [they]_p1773 could run after [his]_p1762 father and continue being of help to him. Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to [Gregor]_n239 than was absolutely necessary? The household budget became even smaller so now the maid was dismissed an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around [her]_p1774 head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work everything else was looked after by [Gregor]_n240 's mother on top of the large amount of sewing work [she]_p1775 did. [Gregor]_n241 even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price [they]_p1776 had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing [them]_p1777 at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for [their]_p1778 present circumstances, [they]_p1779 could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring [Gregor]_n242 to the new address. [He]_p1780 could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for [him]_p1781 that made [it]_p1783 difficult for [them]_p1786 to move, [it]_p1784 would have been quite easy to transport [him]_p1782 in any suitable crate with a few air holes in [it]_p1784 the main thing holding the family back from [their]_p1787 decision to move was much more to do with [their]_p1788 total despair, and the thought that [they]_p1789 had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else [they]_p1790 knew or were related to. [They]_p1791 carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, [Gregor]_n243 's father brought bank employees [their]_p1792 breakfast, [his]_p1793 mother sacrificed [herself]_p1795 by washing clothes for strangers, [his]_p1794 sister ran back and forth behind [her]_p1796 desk at the behest of the customers, but [they]_p1797 just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in [Gregor]_n244 's back began to hurt as much as when [it]_p1798 was new. After [they]_p1799 had come back from taking [his]_p1802 father to bed [Gregor]_n245 's mother and sister would now leave [their]_p1804 work where [it]_p1806 was and sit close together, cheek to cheek [his]_p1803 mother would point to [Gregor]_n246 's room and say""Close that door, [Grete]_n247"", and then, when [he]_p1807 was in the dark again, [they]_p1800 would sit in the next room and [their]_p1805 tears would mingle, or [they]_p1800 would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.",12,,57,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n248 hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes [he]_p1808 would think of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened [he]_p1809 had long forgotten about [his]_p1812 boss and the chief clerk, but [they]_p1816 would appear again in [his]_p1813 thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom [his]_p1813 attention had been serious but too slow, - all of [them]_p1819 appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others [he]_p1809 had forgotten, but instead of helping [him]_p1821 and [his]_p1814 family [they]_p1817 were all of [them]_p1820 inaccessible, and [he]_p1810 was glad when [they]_p1817 disappeared. Other times [he]_p1823 was not at all in the mood to look after [his]_p1833 family, [he]_p1824 was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention [he]_p1824 was shown, and although [he]_p1825 could think of nothing [he]_p1825 would have wanted, [he]_p1825 made plans of how [he]_p1826 could get into the pantry where [he]_p1826 could take all the things [he]_p1826 was entitled to, even if [he]_p1826 was not hungry. [Gregor]_n249 's sister no longer thought about how [she]_p1834 could please [him]_p1837 but would hurriedly push some food or other into [his]_p1838 room with [her]_p1839 foot before [she]_p1835 rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening [she]_p1835 would sweep [it]_p1840 away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether [it]_p1841 had been eaten or - more often than not - had been left totally untouched. [She]_p1842 still cleared up the room in the evening, but now [she]_p1843 could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, [Gregor]_n250 went into one of the worst of these places when [his]_p1844 sister arrived as a reproach to her, but [he]_p1846 could have stayed there for weeks without [his]_p1845 sister doing anything about [it]_p1848 [she]_p1850 could see the dirt as well as [he]_p1847 could but [she]_p1851 had simply decided to leave [him]_p1852 to it. At the same time [she]_p1853 became touchy in a way that was quite new for [her]_p1854 and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up [Gregor]_n251 's room was for [her]_p1855 and [her]_p1855 alone. [Gregor]_n252 's mother did once thoroughly clean [his]_p1857 room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do [it]_p1858 - although that much dampness also made [Gregor]_n253 ill and [he]_p1859 lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But [his]_p1860 mother was to be punished still more for what [she]_p1862 had done, as hardly had [his]_p1861 sister arrived home in the evening than [she]_p1863 noticed the change in [Gregor]_n254 's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room where, despite [her]_p1865 mothers raised and imploring hands, [she]_p1863 broke into convulsive tears.",7,,56,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Her]_p1866 father, of course, was startled out of [his]_p1867 chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless then they, too, became agitated [Gregor]_n255 's father, standing to the right of [his]_p1868 mother, accused [her]_p1873 of not leaving the cleaning of [Gregor]_n256 's room to [his]_p1868 sister from [her]_p1874 l[eft, G]_n257 regor's sister screamed at [her]_p1874 that [she]_p1877 was never[ to cl]_n258 ean Gregor's room again while [his]_p1869 mother tried to draw [his]_p1869 father, who was beside [himself]_p1878 with anger, into the bedroom [his]_p1869 sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with [her]_p1875 s[mall f]_n259 ists and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save [him]_p1879 the sight of this and all [its]_p1880 noise. [Gregor]_n260 's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after [Gregor]_n261 as [she]_p1881 had done before was even more work for her, but even so [his]_p1884 mother ought certainly not to have taken [her]_p1882 place. [Gregor]_n262 , on the other hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was here. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made [her]_p1885 able to withstand the hardest of things in [her]_p1886 long life, wasn't really repelled by [Gregor]_n263. Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, [she]_p1887 opened the door to [Gregor]_n264 's room and found [herself]_p1888 face to face with him. [He]_p1889 was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing [him]_p1890 but [he]_p1891 began to rush to and fro while [she]_p1892 just stood there in amazement with [her]_p1893 hands crossed in front of her. From then on [she]_p1895 never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him. At first [she]_p1896 would call to [him]_p1899 as [she]_p1897 did so with words that [she]_p1897 probably considered friendly, such as""come on then, [you]_p1900 old dung-beetle!"", or""look at the old dung-beetle there!""[Gregor]_n265 never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where [he]_p1901 was without moving as if the door had never even been opened. If only [they]_p1902 had told this charwoman to clean up [his]_p1903 room every day instead of letting [her]_p1904 disturb [him]_p1905 for no reason whenever [she]_p1907 felt like it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, [she]_p1908 began to speak to [him]_p1906 in that way once again.",11,,41,
kafka_metamorphosis," [Gregor]_n266 was so resentful of [it]_p1909 that [he]_p1911 started to move toward her, [he]_p1912 was slow and infirm, but [it]_p1910 was like a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with [her]_p1913 mouth open, clearly intending not to close [her]_p1914 mouth until the chair in [her]_p1914 hand had been slammed down into [Gregor]_n267 's back. ""Aren't [you]_p1916 coming any closer, then?"", [she]_p1917 asked when [Gregor]_n268 turned round again, and [she]_p1918 calmly put the chair back in the corner. [Gregor]_n269 had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if [he]_p1919 happened to find [himself]_p1921 next to the food that had been prepared for [him]_p1922 [he]_p1920 might take some of [it]_p1923 into [his]_p1927 mouth to play with it, leave [it]_p1924 there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit [it]_p1924 out again. At first [he]_p1928 thought [it]_p1930 was distress at the state of [his]_p1931 room that stopped [him]_p1932 eating, but [he]_p1929 had soon got used to the changes made there. [They]_p1933 had got into the habit of putting things into this room that [they]_p1934 had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen - all three of [them]_p1935 had full beards, as [Gregor]_n270 learned peering through the crack in the door one day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy. This meant not only in [their]_p1936 own room but, since [they]_p1937 had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something [they]_p1938 could not tolerate, especially if [it]_p1939 was dirty.",5,,30,
kafka_metamorphosis," [They]_p1940 had moreover brought most of [their]_p1941 own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although [they]_p1942 could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found [their]_p1943 way into [Gregor]_n271 's room. The dustbins from the kitchen found [their]_p1944 way in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything [she]_p1945 couldn't use for the time being [she]_p1946 would just chuck in there. He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when [she]_p1947 had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that [they]_p1948 were left where [they]_p1949 landed when [they]_p1949 had first been thrown unless [Gregor]_n272 made [his]_p1951 way through the junk and moved [it]_p1952 somewhere else. At first [he]_p1953 moved [it]_p1958 because, with no other room free where [he]_p1954 could crawl about, [he]_p1954 was forced to, but later on [he]_p1955 came to enjoy [it]_p1959 although moving about in that way left [him]_p1960 sad and tired to death, and [he]_p1955 would remain immobile for hours afterwards. The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take [their]_p1961 evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But [Gregor]_n273 found [it]_p1962 easy to give up having the door open, [he]_p1966 had, after all, often failed to make use of [it]_p1963 when [it]_p1963 was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in [his]_p1967 room in [its]_p1968 darkest corner.",3,,28,
kafka_metamorphosis," One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and [it]_p1969 remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on. [They]_p1970 sat up at the table where, formerly, [Gregor]_n274 had taken [his]_p1971 meals with [his]_p1972 father and mother, [they]_p1973 unfolded the serviettes and picked up [their]_p1974 knives and forks. [Gregor]_n275 's mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind [her]_p1975 came [his]_p1976 sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The food was steaming, and filled the room with [its]_p1977 smell. The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of [them]_p1978 as if [they]_p1979 wanted to test the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while [it]_p1980 was still in [its]_p1984 dish, clearly wishing to establish whether [it]_p1981 was sufficiently cooked or whether [it]_p1981 should be sent back to the kitchen. [It]_p1985 was to [his]_p1986 satisfaction, and [Gregor]_n276 's mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled. The family [themselves]_p1987 ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, [Gregor]_n277 's father came into the living room before [he]_p1988 went into the kitchen, bowed once with [his]_p1989 cap in [his]_p1990 hand and did [his]_p1990 round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into [their]_p1992 beards. Then, once [they]_p1993 were alone, [they]_p1994 ate in near perfect silence.",4,,25,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p1995 seemed remarkable to [Gregor]_n278 that above all the various noises of eating [their]_p1996 chewing teeth could still be heard, as if [they]_p1997 had wanted to show [Gregor]_n279 that [you]_p1999 need teeth in order to eat and [it]_p2000 was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice [they]_p1998 might be. ""I'd like to eat something"", said [Gregor]_n280 anxiously,""but not anything like they're eating. [They]_p2001 do feed themselves. And here [I]_p2002 am, dying!""Throughout all this time, [Gregor]_n281 could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening [it]_p2003 began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished [their]_p2004 meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now [they]_p2006 leant back in [their]_p2005 chairs reading [them]_p2007 and smoking. When the violin began playing [they]_p2008 became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where [they]_p2009 stood pressed against each other. Someone must have heard [them]_p2010 in the kitchen, as [Gregor]_n282 's father called out:""Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen? [We]_p2011 can stop [it]_p2012 straight away. """"On the contrary"", said the middle gentleman,""would the young lady not like to come in and play for [us]_p2013 here in the room, where [it]_p2014 is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?""""Oh yes, we'd love to"", called back [Gregor]_n283 's father as if [he]_p2015 had been the violin player himself. The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. [Gregor]_n284 's father soon appeared with the music stand, [his]_p2016 mother with the music and [his]_p2017 sister with the violin.",7,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," [She]_p2018 calmly prepared everything for [her]_p2019 to begin playing [his]_p2020 parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on [their]_p2025 own chairs [his]_p2021 father leant against the door with [his]_p2021 right hand pushed in between two buttons on [his]_p2022 uniform coat [his]_p2022 mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed [it]_p2026 - out of the way in a corner. [His]_p2027 sister began to play father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of [her]_p2028 hands. Drawn in by the playing, [Gregor]_n285 had dared to come forward a little and already had [his]_p2029 head in the living room. Before, [he]_p2030 had taken great pride in how considerate [he]_p2031 was but now [it]_p2033 hardly occurred to [him]_p2034 that [he]_p2031 had become so thoughtless about the others. What's more, there was now all the more reason to keep [himself]_p2035 hidden as [he]_p2037 was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in [his]_p2041 room and flew up at the slightest movement [he]_p2038 carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on [his]_p2042 back and sides [he]_p2038 was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on [his]_p2042 back and wipe [himself]_p2036 on the carpet like [he]_p2039 had used to do several times a day. And despite this condition, [he]_p2044 was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room. No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing at first, the three gentlemen had put [their]_p2045 hands in [their]_p2046 pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played, and [they]_p2048 must have disturbed [Gregor]_n286 's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, [they]_p2049 withdrew back to the window with [their]_p2046 heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and [they]_p2049 stayed by the window while [Gregor]_n287 's father observed [them]_p2051 anxiously. [It]_p2052 really now seemed very obvious that [they]_p2053 had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that [they]_p2054 had had enough of the whole performance and [it]_p2056 was only now out of politeness that [they]_p2054 allowed [their]_p2057 peace to be disturbed. [It]_p2058 was especially unnerving, the way [they]_p2059 all blew the smoke from [their]_p2060 cigarettes upwards from [their]_p2061 mouth and noses.",3,,44,
kafka_metamorphosis," Yet [Gregor]_n288 's sister was playing so beautifully. [Her]_p2062 face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. [Gregor]_n289 crawled a little further forward, keeping [his]_p2063 head close to the ground so that [he]_p2064 could meet [her]_p2065 eyes if the chance came. Was [he]_p2066 an animal if music could captivate [him]_p2069 so? [It]_p2071 seemed to [him]_p2070 that [he]_p2067 was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment [he]_p2067 had been yearning for. [He]_p2072 was determined to make [his]_p2073 way forward to [his]_p2074 sister and tug at [her]_p2076 skirt to show [her]_p2077 [she]_p2080 might come into [his]_p2074 room with [her]_p2077 violin, as no-one appreciated [her]_p2078 playing here as much as [he]_p2081 would. [He]_p2082 never wanted to let [her]_p2083 out of [his]_p2088 room, not while [he]_p2092 lived, anyway [his]_p2089 shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to [him]_p2097 [he]_p2093 wanted to be at every door of [his]_p2089 room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers [his]_p2090 sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of [her]_p2084 own free will [she]_p2102 would sit beside [him]_p2098 on the couch with [her]_p2084 ear bent down to [him]_p2098 while [he]_p2093 told [her]_p2085 how [he]_p2094 had always intended to send [her]_p2085 to the conservatory, how [he]_p2094 would have told everyone about [it]_p2103 last [Christmas]_n290 - had [Christmas]_n291 really come and gone already? - if this misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade [him]_p2099 from it. On hearing all this, [his]_p2105 sister would break out in tears of emotion, and [Gregor]_n292 would climb up to [her]_p2106 shoulder and kiss [her]_p2107 neck, which, since [she]_p2108 had been going out to work, [she]_p2109 had kept free without any necklace or collar. ""[Mr Samsa]_n293 !"", shouted the middle gentleman to [Gregor]_n294 's father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with [his]_p2110 forefinger at [Gregor]_n295 as [he]_p2111 slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at [his]_p2112 two friends, shaking [his]_p2113 head, and then looked back at [Gregor]_n296. [His]_p2114 father seemed to think [it]_p2115 more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving [Gregor]_n297 out, even though [they]_p2116 were not at all upset and seemed to think [Gregor]_n298 was more entertaining than the violin playing had been.",11,,53,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2117 rushed up to [them]_p2118 with [his]_p2120 arms spread out and attempted to drive [them]_p2119 back into [their]_p2122 room at the same time as trying to block [their]_p2123 view of [Gregor]_n299 with [his]_p2121 body. Now [they]_p2124 did become a little annoyed, and [it]_p2126 was not clear whether [it]_p2127 was [his]_p2129 father's behaviour that annoyed [them]_p2130 or the dawning realisation that [they]_p2125 had had a neighbour like [Gregor]_n300 in the next room without knowing it. [They]_p2131 asked [Gregor]_n301 's father for explanations, raised [their]_p2132 arms like [he]_p2135 had, tugged excitedly at [their]_p2133 beards and moved back towards [their]_p2133 room only very slowly. Meanwhile [Gregor]_n302 's sister had overcome the despair [she]_p2136 had fallen into when [her]_p2137 playing was suddenly interrupted. [She]_p2138 had let [her]_p2139 hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then [she]_p2142 suddenly pulled [herself]_p2144 together, lay the instrument on [her]_p2140 mother's lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where [she]_p2143 was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from [her]_p2140 father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward. Under [his]_p2145 sister's experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and [she]_p2146 had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room. [Gregor]_n303 's father seemed so obsessed with what [he]_p2147 was doing that [he]_p2148 forgot all the respect [he]_p2148 owed to [his]_p2150 tenants. [He]_p2151 urged [them]_p2152 and pressed [them]_p2153 until, when [he]_p2154 was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped [his]_p2155 foot and thereby brought [Gregor]_n304 's father to a halt. ""[I]_p2156 declare here and now"", [he]_p2158 said, raising [his]_p2160 hand and glancing at [Gregor]_n305 's mother and sister to gain [their]_p2161 attention too,""that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family""- here [he]_p2159 looked briefly but decisively at the floor -""[I]_p2157 give immediate notice on [my]_p2162 room. For the days that [I]_p2163 have been living here [I]_p2164 will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary [I]_p2164 will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe [me]_p2166 [it]_p2167 would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.",7,,50,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" [He]_p2168 was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, [his]_p2169 two friends joined in with the words: ""And [we]_p2170 also give immediate notice. "" With that, [he]_p2171 took hold of the door handle and slammed the door. [Gregor]_n306 's father staggered back to [his]_p2172 seat, feeling [his]_p2173 way with [his]_p2173 hands, and fell into [it]_p2177 [it]_p2178 looked as if [he]_p2180 was stretching [himself]_p2182 out for [his]_p2174 usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way [his]_p2174 head kept nodding [it]_p2178 could be seen that [he]_p2181 was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, [Gregor]_n307 had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. [His]_p2183 disappointment at the failure of [his]_p2184 plan, and perhaps also because [he]_p2185 was weak from hunger, made [it]_p2186 impossible for [him]_p2187 to move. [He]_p2188 was sure that everyone would turn on [him]_p2189 any moment, and [he]_p2190 waited. [He]_p2191 was not even startled out of this state when the violin on [his]_p2192 mother's lap fell from [her]_p2193 trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor. ""[Father]_n308 , [Mother]_n309"", said [his]_p2194 sister, hitting the table with [her]_p2195 hand as introduction,""[we]_p2196 can't carry on like this. Maybe [you]_p2197 can't see it, but [I]_p2198 can.",4,,31,
kafka_metamorphosis," [I]_p2199 don't want to call this monster [my]_p2201 brother, all [I]_p2200 can say is: [we]_p2202 have to try and get rid of it. We've done all that's humanly possible to look after [it]_p2203 and be patient, [I]_p2204 don't think anyone could accuse [us]_p2205 of doing anything wrong. """"She's absolutely right"", said [Gregor]_n310 's father to himself. [His]_p2206 mother, who still had not had time to catch [her]_p2207 breath, began to cough dully, [her]_p2208 hand held out in front of [her]_p2208 and a deranged expression in [her]_p2209 eyes. [Gregor]_n311 's sister rushed to [his]_p2211 mother and put [her]_p2212 hand on [her]_p2213 forehead. [Her]_p2214 words seemed to give [Gregor]_n312 's father some more definite ideas. [He]_p2215 sat upright, played with [his]_p2216 uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after [their]_p2217 meal, and occasionally looked down at [Gregor]_n313 as [he]_p2218 lay there immobile. ""[We]_p2219 have to try and get rid of [it]_p2220"", said [Gregor]_n314 's sister, now speaking only to [her]_p2223 father, as [her]_p2224 mother was too occupied with coughing to listen,""it'll be the death of both of you, [I]_p2225 can see [it]_p2221 coming. [We]_p2226 can't all work as hard as [we]_p2227 have to and then come home to be tortured like this, [we]_p2228 can't endure it. [I]_p2229 can't endure [it]_p2230 any more.",5,,31,
kafka_metamorphosis," "" And [she]_p2231 broke out so heavily in tears that [they]_p2233 flowed down the face of [her]_p2234 mother, and [she]_p2232 wiped [them]_p2235 away with mechanical hand movements. ""[My]_p2236 child"", said [her]_p2237 father with sympathy and obvious understanding, ""what are [we]_p2241 to do?""  [His]_p2242 sister just shrugged [her]_p2238 shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing [her]_p2238 earlier certainty. ""If [he]_p2243 could just understand [us]_p2244"", said [his]_p2245 father almost as a question [his]_p2246 sister shook [her]_p2247 hand vigorously through [her]_p2248 tears as a sign that of that there was no question. ""If [he]_p2249 could just understand [us]_p2250"", repeated [Gregor]_n315 's father, closing [his]_p2251 eyes in acceptance of [his]_p2252 sister's certainty that that was quite impossible,""then perhaps [we]_p2253 could come to some kind of arrangement with him. But as [it]_p2254 is. """"It's got to go"", shouted [his]_p2255 sister,""that's the only way, [Father]_n316. You've got to get rid of the idea that that's [Gregor]_n317. We've only harmed [ourselves]_p2256 by believing [it]_p2257 for so long. How can that be [Gregor]_n318 ? If [it]_p2258 were [Gregor]_n319 [he]_p2260 would have seen long ago that it's not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and [he]_p2261 would have gone of [his]_p2262 own free will. [We]_p2263 wouldn't have a brother any more, then, but [we]_p2264 could carry on with [our]_p2265 lives and remember [him]_p2266 with respect.",5,,34,
kafka_metamorphosis," As [it]_p2267 is this animal is persecuting us, it's driven out [our]_p2272 tenants, [it]_p2268 obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force [us]_p2270 to sleep on the streets. [Father]_n320 , look, just look"", [she]_p2273 suddenly screamed,""he's starting again!""In [her]_p2275 alarm, which was totally beyond [Gregor]_n321 's comprehension, [his]_p2278 sister even abandoned [his]_p2279 mother as [she]_p2274 pushed [herself]_p2280 vigorously out of [her]_p2276 chair as if more willing to sacrifice [her]_p2276 own mother than stay anywhere near [Gregor]_n322. [She]_p2281 rushed over to behind [her]_p2282 father, who had become excited merely because [she]_p2284 was and stood up half raising [his]_p2285 hands in front of [Gregor]_n323 's sister as if to protect her. But [Gregor]_n324 had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all [his]_p2286 sister. All [he]_p2287 had done was begin to turn round so that [he]_p2288 could go back into [his]_p2290 room, although that was in [itself]_p2293 quite startling as [his]_p2291 pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and [he]_p2288 was using [his]_p2291 head to help [himself]_p2294 do it, repeatedly raising [it]_p2295 and striking [it]_p2296 against the floor. [He]_p2298 stopped and looked round. [They]_p2299 seemed to have realised [his]_p2300 good intention and had only been alarmed briefly. Now [they]_p2301 all looked at [him]_p2302 in unhappy silence. [His]_p2303 mother lay in [her]_p2304 chair with [her]_p2305 legs stretched out and pressed against each other, [her]_p2305 eyes nearly closed with exhaustion [his]_p2308 sister sat next to [his]_p2309 father with [her]_p2306 arms around [his]_p2309 neck. ""Maybe now they'll let [me]_p2311 turn round"", thought [Gregor]_n325 and went back to work.",6,,41,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2312 could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making [him]_p2313 rush any more, everything was left up to him. As soon as [he]_p2315 had finally finished turning round [he]_p2316 began to move straight ahead. [He]_p2317 was amazed at the great distance that separated [him]_p2318 from [his]_p2319 room, and could not understand how [he]_p2321 had covered that distance in [his]_p2320 weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it. [He]_p2322 concentrated on crawling as fast as [he]_p2323 could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from [his]_p2324 family to distract him. [He]_p2325 did not turn [his]_p2326 head until [he]_p2327 had reached the doorway. [He]_p2328 did not turn [it]_p2329 all the way round as [he]_p2331 felt [his]_p2332 neck becoming stiff, but [it]_p2330 was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind [him]_p2334 had changed, only [his]_p2333 sister had stood up. With [his]_p2335 last glance [he]_p2337 saw that [his]_p2336 mother had now fallen completely asleep. [He]_p2338 was hardly inside [his]_p2339 room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind [Gregor]_n326 so startled [him]_p2340 that [his]_p2342 little legs collapsed under him.",1,,29,
kafka_metamorphosis," [It]_p2343 was [his]_p2344 sister who had been in so much of a rush. [She]_p2345 had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, [Gregor]_n327 had not heard [her]_p2346 coming at all, and as [she]_p2348 turned the key in the lock [she]_p2349 said loudly to [her]_p2347 parents""At last!"". ""What now, then?"", [Gregor]_n328 asked [himself]_p2350 as [he]_p2351 looked round in the darkness. [He]_p2352 soon made the discovery that [he]_p2353 could no longer move at all. This was no surprise to him, [it]_p2354 seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. [He]_p2355 also felt relatively comfortable. [It]_p2356 is true that [his]_p2357 entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. [He]_p2358 could already hardly feel the decayed apple in [his]_p2359 back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust. [He]_p2360 thought back of [his]_p2361 family with emotion and love. If [it]_p2362 was possible, [he]_p2363 felt that [he]_p2364 must go away even more strongly than [his]_p2365 sister.",2,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," [He]_p2366 remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until [he]_p2367 heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. [He]_p2368 watched as [it]_p2369 slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. Then, without [his]_p2370 willing it, [his]_p2371 head sank down completely, and [his]_p2371 last breath flowed weakly from [his]_p2372 nostrils. When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked [her]_p2374 not to keep slamming the doors but with [her]_p2375 strength and in [her]_p2375 hurry [she]_p2378 still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd arrived and from then on [it]_p2381 was impossible to sleep in peace - [she]_p2379 made [her]_p2376 usual brief look in on [Gregor]_n329 and at first found nothing special. [She]_p2382 thought [he]_p2383 was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr [she]_p2384 attributed all possible understanding to him. [She]_p2385 happened to be holding the long broom in [her]_p2386 hand, so [she]_p2387 tried to tickle [Gregor]_n330 with [it]_p2388 from the doorway. When [she]_p2389 had no success with that [she]_p2390 tried to make a nuisance of [herself]_p2394 and poked at [him]_p2395 a little, and only when [she]_p2390 found [she]_p2391 could shove [him]_p2396 across the floor with no resistance at all did [she]_p2391 start to pay attention. [She]_p2397 soon realised what had really happened, opened [her]_p2398 eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms:""Come and 'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!""Mr and [Mrs Samsa]_n331 sat upright there in [their]_p2399 marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before [they]_p2400 could grasp what [she]_p2401 was saying. But then, each from [his]_p2402 own side, [they]_p2403 hurried out of bed. [Mr Samsa]_n332 threw the blanket over [his]_p2404 shoulders, [Mrs Samsa]_n333 just came out in [her]_p2405 nightdress and that is how [they]_p2406 went into [Gregor]_n334 's room.",6,,40,
kafka_metamorphosis," On the way [they]_p2407 opened the door to the living room where [Grete]_n335 had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in [she]_p2408 was fully dressed as if [she]_p2409 had never been asleep, and the paleness of [her]_p2410 face seemed to confirm this. ""[Dead]_n336 ?"", asked [Mrs Samsa]_n337 , looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though [she]_p2411 could have checked for [herself]_p2412 and could have known [it]_p2413 even without checking. ""That's what [I]_p2414 said"", replied the cleaner, and to prove [it]_p2415 [she]_p2417 gave [Gregor]_n338 's body another shove with the broom, sending [it]_p2416 sideways across the floor. [Mrs Samsa]_n339 made a movement as if [she]_p2418 wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. ""Now then"", said [Mr Samsa]_n340 ,""let's give thanks to God for that"". [He]_p2419 crossed himself, and the three women followed [his]_p2420 example. [Grete]_n341 , who had not taken [her]_p2421 eyes from the corpse, said:""Just look how thin [he]_p2422 was. [He]_p2423 didn't eat anything for so long. The food came out again just the same as when [it]_p2424 went in"". [Gregor]_n342 's body was indeed completely dried up and flat, [they]_p2425 had not seen [it]_p2426 until then, but now [he]_p2427 was not lifted up on [his]_p2429 little legs, nor did [he]_p2428 do anything to make [them]_p2430 look away.",8,,24,
kafka_metamorphosis," ""[Grete]_n343 , come with [us]_p2431 in here for a little while"", said [Mrs Samsa]_n344 with a pained smile, and [Grete]_n345 followed [her]_p2432 parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although [it]_p2433 was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. [It]_p2435 was already the end of [March]_n346 , after all. The three gentlemen stepped out of [their]_p2436 room and looked round in amazement for [their]_p2437 breakfasts [they]_p2438 had been forgotten about. ""Where is [our]_p2439 breakfast?"", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. [She]_p2440 just put [her]_p2441 finger on [her]_p2442 lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that [they]_p2443 might like to come into [Gregor]_n347 's room. [They]_p2444 did so, and stood around [Gregor]_n348 's corpse with [their]_p2445 hands in the pockets of [their]_p2446 well-worn coats. [It]_p2447 was now quite light in the room. Then the door of the bedroom opened and [Mr Samsa]_n349 appeared in [his]_p2448 uniform with [his]_p2449 wife on one arm and [his]_p2449 daughter on the other.",7,,19,
kafka_metamorphosis," All of [them]_p2451 had been crying a little [Grete]_n350 now and then pressed [her]_p2452 face against [her]_p2453 father's arm. ""Leave [my]_p2454 home. Now!"", said [Mr Samsa]_n351 , indicating the door and without letting the women from him. ""What do [you]_p2455 mean?"", asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and [he]_p2456 smiled sweetly. The other two held [their]_p2457 hands behind [their]_p2458 backs and continually rubbed [them]_p2460 together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in [their]_p2458 favour. ""[I]_p2461 mean just what [I]_p2462 said"", answered [Mr Samsa]_n352 , and, with [his]_p2463 two companions, went in a straight line towards the man. At first, [he]_p2464 stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of [his]_p2465 head were rearranging [themselves]_p2466 into new positions. ""[Alright]_n353 , we'll go then"", [he]_p2467 said, and looked up at [Mr Samsa]_n354 as if [he]_p2468 had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from [Mr Samsa]_n355 for [his]_p2469 decision. [Mr Samsa]_n356 merely opened [his]_p2470 eyes wide and briefly nodded to [him]_p2471 several times. At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway [his]_p2472 two friends had stopped rubbing [their]_p2473 hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said.",7,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," Now [they]_p2474 jumped off after [their]_p2475 friend as if taken with a sudden fear that [Mr Samsa]_n357 might go into the hallway in front of [them]_p2477 and break the connection with [their]_p2476 leader. Once there, all three took [their]_p2478 hats from the stand, took [their]_p2479 sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the premises. [Mr Samsa]_n358 and the two women followed [them]_p2480 out onto the landing but [they]_p2481 had had no reason to mistrust the men's intentions and as [they]_p2482 leaned over the landing [they]_p2482 saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As [they]_p2484 turned the corner on each floor [they]_p2485 disappeared and would reappear a few moments later the further down [they]_p2485 went, the more that the [Samsa]_n359 family lost interest in [them]_p2488 when a butcher's boy, proud of posture with [his]_p2490 tray on [his]_p2491 head, passed [them]_p2489 on [his]_p2491 way up and came nearer than [they]_p2486 were, [Mr Samsa]_n360 and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat. [They]_p2493 decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk not only had [they]_p2494 earned a break from work but [they]_p2495 were in serious need of it. So [they]_p2496 sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal, [Mr Samsa]_n361 to [his]_p2497 employers, [Mrs Samsa]_n362 to [her]_p2498 contractor and [Grete]_n363 to [her]_p2499 principal. The cleaner came in while [they]_p2500 were writing to tell [them]_p2501 [she]_p2502 was going, she'd finished [her]_p2504 work for that morning. The three of [them]_p2505 at first just nodded without looking up from what [they]_p2506 were writing, and [it]_p2508 was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that [they]_p2507 looked up in irritation. ""Well?"", asked [Mr Samsa]_n364. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on [her]_p2509 face as if [she]_p2510 had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do [it]_p2512 if [she]_p2511 was clearly asked to.",8,,38,
kafka_metamorphosis," The almost vertical little ostrich feather on [her]_p2513 hat, which had been a source of irritation to [Mr Samsa]_n365 all the time [she]_p2514 had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. ""What is [it]_p2515 [you]_p2516 want then?"", asked [Mrs Samsa]_n366 , whom the cleaner had the most respect for. ""Yes"", [she]_p2517 answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made [her]_p2518 unable to speak straight away, ""well then, that thing in there, [you]_p2519 needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it. That's all been sorted out. ""[Mrs Samsa]_n367 and [Grete]_n368 bent down over [their]_p2521 letters as if intent on continuing with what [they]_p2522 were writing [Mr Samsa]_n369 saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, [he]_p2523 made [it]_p2524 quite clear that [she]_p2525 was not to. So, as [she]_p2526 was prevented from telling [them]_p2530 all about it, [she]_p2527 suddenly remembered what a hurry [she]_p2527 was in and, clearly peeved, called out""[Cheerio]_n370 then, everyone"", turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as [she]_p2528 went. ""Tonight [she]_p2531 gets sacked"", said [Mr Samsa]_n371 , but [he]_p2532 received no reply from either [his]_p2533 wife or [his]_p2534 daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace [they]_p2535 had only just gained. [They]_p2536 got up and went over to the window where [they]_p2537 remained with [their]_p2538 arms around each other. [Mr Samsa]_n372 twisted round in [his]_p2539 chair to look at [them]_p2540 and sat there watching for a while. Then [he]_p2541 called out: ""Come here, then.",8,,28,
kafka_metamorphosis," Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give [me]_p2542 a bit of attention"". The two women immediately did as [he]_p2543 said, hurrying over to [him]_p2544 where [they]_p2547 kissed [him]_p2545 and hugged [him]_p2545 and then [they]_p2548 quickly finished [their]_p2549 letters. After that, the three of [them]_p2550 left the flat together, which was something [they]_p2551 had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. [They]_p2552 had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on [their]_p2553 seats, [they]_p2556 discussed [their]_p2554 prospects and found that on closer examination [they]_p2557 were not at all bad - until then [they]_p2557 had never asked each other about [their]_p2554 work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house what [they]_p2559 needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by [Gregor]_n373 , one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, [Grete]_n374 was becoming livelier. With all the worry [they]_p2560 had been having of late [her]_p2562 cheeks had become pale, but, while [they]_p2561 were talking, Mr and [Mrs Samsa]_n375 were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how [their]_p2563 daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady. [They]_p2564 became quieter.",3,,23,
kafka_metamorphosis," Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing [it]_p2565 [they]_p2567 agreed that [it]_p2566 would soon be time to find a good man for her. And, as if in confirmation of [their]_p2568 new dreams and good intentions, as soon as [they]_p2570 reached [their]_p2569 destination [Grete]_n376 was the first to get up and stretch out [her]_p2571 young body.",1,,7,
