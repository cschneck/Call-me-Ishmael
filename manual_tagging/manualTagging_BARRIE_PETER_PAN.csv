barrie_peter_pan,"Chapter 1 [PETER]_n0 BREAKS THROUGH All children, except one, grow up. [They]_p0 soon know that [they]_p1 will grow up, and the way [Wendy]_n1 knew was this. [One]_n2 day when [she]_p2 was two years old [she]_p3 was playing in a garden, and [she]_p3 plucked another flower and ran with [it]_p5 to [her]_p6 mother. [I]_p7 suppose [she]_p8 must have looked rather delightful, for [Mrs Darling]_n3 put [her]_p9 hand to [her]_p10 heart and cried,. ""Oh, why can't [you]_p11 remain like this for ever!"". This was all that passed between [them]_p12 on the subject, but henceforth [Wendy]_n4 knew that [she]_p13 must grow up. [You]_p14 always know after [you]_p15 are two. Two is the beginning of the end. Of course [they]_p16 lived at 14 [their house number on [their]_p17 street], and until [Wendy]_n5 came [her]_p19 mother was the chief one. [She]_p20 was a lovely [lady]_n6 , with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.",7,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," [Her]_p21 romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling [East]_n7 , however many [you]_p22 discover there is always one more and [her]_p23 sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on [it]_p24 that [Wendy]_n8 could never get, though there [it]_p25 was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner. The way [Mr Darling]_n9 won [her]_p26 was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when [she]_p31 was a girl discovered simultaneously that [they]_p32 loved her, and [they]_p33 all ran to [her]_p27 house to propose to [her]_p27 except [Mr Darling]_n10 , who took a cab and nipped in first, and so [he]_p34 got her. [He]_p35 got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. [He]_p36 never knew about the box, and in time [he]_p37 gave up trying for the kiss. [Wendy]_n11 thought [Napoleon]_n12 could have got it, but [I]_p38 can picture [him]_p39 trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door. [Mr Darling]_n13 used to boast to [Wendy]_n14 that [her]_p40 mother not only loved [him]_p41 but respected him. [He]_p43 was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but [he]_p44 quite seemed to know, and [he]_p45 often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him. [Mrs Darling]_n15 was married in white, and at first [she]_p46 kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if [it]_p47 were a game, not so much as a [Brussels]_n16 sprout was missing but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of [them]_p48 there were pictures of babies without faces. [She]_p49 drew [them]_p50 when [she]_p51 should have been totting up.",10,,28,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p52 were [Mrs Darling]_n17 's guesses. [Wendy]_n18 came first, then [John]_n19 , then [Michael]_n20. For a week or two after [Wendy]_n21 came [it]_p53 was doubtful whether [they]_p54 would be able to keep her, as [she]_p55 was another mouth to feed. [Mr Darling]_n22 was frightfully proud of her, but [he]_p58 was very honourable, and [he]_p59 sat on the edge of [Mrs Darling]_n23 's bed, holding [her]_p56 hand and calculating expenses, while [she]_p60 looked at [him]_p61 imploringly. [She]_p62 wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not [his]_p63 way [his]_p64 way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if [she]_p65 confused [him]_p66 with suggestions [he]_p67 had to begin at the beginning again. ""Now don't interrupt,"". [he]_p68 would beg of her. ""[I]_p69 have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office [I]_p70 can cut off [my]_p73 coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with [your]_p76 eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in [my]_p74 cheque-book makes eight nine seven, who is that moving?, eight nine seven, dot and carry seven, don't speak, [my]_p74 own, and the pound [you]_p77 lent to that man who came to the door, quiet, child, dot and carry child, there, you've done it!, did [I]_p70 say nine nine seven? yes, [I]_p71 said nine nine seven the question is, can [we]_p81 try [it]_p79 for a year on nine nine seven?. ""Of course [we]_p82 can, [George]_n24 ,"". [she]_p83 cried.",8,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," But [she]_p84 was prejudiced in [Wendy]_n25 's favour, and [he]_p85 was really the grander character of the two. ""Remember mumps,"". [he]_p86 warned [her]_p88 almost threateningly, and off [he]_p87 went again. ""Mumps one pound, that is what [I]_p89 have put down, but [I]_p90 daresay [it]_p91 will be more like thirty shillings, don't speak, measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six, don't waggle [your]_p94 finger, whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings , and so on [it]_p92 went, and [it]_p92 added up differently each time but at last [Wendy]_n26 just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one. There was the same excitement over [John]_n27 , and [Michael]_n28 had even a narrower squeak but both were kept, and soon, [you]_p95 might have seen the three of [them]_p96 going in a row to [Miss Fulsom]_n29 's [Kindergarten]_n30 school, accompanied by [their]_p97 nurse. [Mrs Darling]_n31 loved to have everything just so, and [Mr Darling]_n32 had a passion for being exactly like [his]_p98 neighbours so, of course, [they]_p99 had a nurse. As [they]_p100 were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim [Newfoundland]_n33 dog, called [Nana]_n34 , who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. [She]_p101 had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with [her]_p102 in [Kensington Gardens]_n35 , where [she]_p104 spent most of [her]_p103 spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom [she]_p105 followed to [their]_p106 homes and complained of to [their]_p107 mistresses. [She]_p108 proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough [she]_p109 was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of [her]_p110 charges made the slightest cry.",11,,27,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course [her]_p111 kennel was in the nursery. [She]_p112 had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when [it]_p113 needs stocking around [your]_p114 throat. [She]_p115 believed to [her]_p116 last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. [It]_p117 was a lesson in propriety to see [her]_p118 escorting the children to school, walking sedately by [their]_p119 side when [they]_p120 were well behaved, and butting [them]_p122 back into line if [they]_p121 strayed. On [John]_n36 's footer [in [England]_n37 soccer was called football,. ""footer"". for short] days [she]_p123 never once forgot [his]_p125 sweater, and [she]_p124 usually carried an umbrella in [her]_p126 mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of [Miss Fulsom]_n38 's school where the nurses wait. [They]_p127 sat on forms, while [Nana]_n39 lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. [They]_p128 affected to ignore [her]_p129 as of an inferior social status to themselves, and [she]_p130 despised [their]_p131 light talk.",4,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p132 resented visits to the nursery from [Mrs Darling]_n40 's friends, but if [they]_p133 did come [she]_p134 first whipped off [Michael]_n41 's pinafore and put [him]_p135 into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out [Wendy]_n42 and made a dash at [John]_n43 's hair. No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and [Mr Darling]_n44 knew it, yet [he]_p136 sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked. [He]_p137 had [his]_p138 position in the city to consider. [Nana]_n45 also troubled [him]_p139 in another way. [He]_p140 had sometimes a feeling that [she]_p141 did not admire him. ""[I]_p142 know [she]_p143 admires [you]_p145 tremendously, [George]_n46 , Mrs Darling would assure him, and then [she]_p144 would sign to the children to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, [Liza]_n47 , was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget [she]_p146 looked in [her]_p149 long skirt and maid's cap, though [she]_p147 had sworn, when engaged, that [she]_p147 would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was [Mrs Darling]_n48 , who would pirouette so wildly that all [you]_p150 could see of [her]_p153 was the kiss, and then if [you]_p151 had dashed at [her]_p154 [you]_p151 might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of [Peter Pan]_n49.",10,,23,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mrs Darling]_n50 first heard of [Peter]_n51 when [she]_p155 was tidying up [her]_p156 children's minds. [It]_p157 is the nightly custom of every good mother after [her]_p158 children are [asleep]_n52 to rummage in [their]_p159 minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into [their]_p160 proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. If [you]_p161 could keep awake (but of course [you]_p162 can't) [you]_p162 would see [your]_p165 own mother doing this, and [you]_p163 would find [it]_p166 very interesting to watch her. [It]_p167 is quite like tidying up drawers. [You]_p168 would see [her]_p169 on [her]_p170 knees, [I]_p172 expect, lingering humorously over some of [your]_p173 contents, wondering where on earth [you]_p174 had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to [her]_p170 cheek as if [it]_p175 were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When [you]_p176 wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which [you]_p177 went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of [your]_p179 mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out [your]_p180 prettier thoughts, ready for [you]_p177 to put on. [I]_p181 don't know whether [you]_p182 have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and [your]_p183 own map can become intensely interesting, but catch [them]_p184 trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like [your]_p185 temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the [Neverland]_n53 is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old [lady]_n54 with a hooked nose. [It]_p186 would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out [your]_p187 tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or [they]_p188 are another map showing through, and [it]_p189 is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.",5,,35,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. [John]_n55 's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over [it]_p190 at which [John]_n56 was shooting, while [Michael]_n57 , who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. [John]_n58 lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, [Michael]_n59 in a wigwam, [Wendy]_n60 in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, [Michael]_n61 had friends at night, [Wendy]_n62 had a pet wolf forsaken by [its]_p192 parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if [they]_p193 stood still in a row [you]_p195 could say of [them]_p196 that [they]_p194 have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching [their]_p197 coracles [simple boat]. [We]_p198 too have been there [we]_p199 can still hear the sound of the surf, though [we]_p200 shall land no more. Of all delectable islands the [Neverland]_n63 is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, [you]_p201 know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When [you]_p202 play at [it]_p204 by day with the chairs and table-cloth, [it]_p205 is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before [you]_p203 go to sleep [it]_p205 becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in [her]_p207 travels through [her]_p208 children's minds [Mrs Darling]_n64 found things [she]_p209 could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word [Peter]_n65.",11,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p210 knew of no [Peter]_n66 , and yet [he]_p211 was here and there in [John]_n67 and [Michael]_n68 's minds, while [Wendy]_n69 's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as [Mrs Darling]_n70 gazed [she]_p212 felt that [it]_p213 had an oddly cocky appearance. ""Yes, [he]_p214 is rather cocky,"". [Wendy]_n71 admitted with regret. [Her]_p215 mother had been questioning her. ""But who is he, [my]_p216 pet?. ""[He]_p217 is [Peter Pan]_n72 , [you]_p218 know, mother. At first [Mrs Darling]_n73 did not know, but after thinking back into [her]_p219 childhood [she]_p220 just remembered a [Peter Pan]_n74 who was said to live with the fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died [he]_p221 went part of the way with them, so that [they]_p222 should not be frightened. [She]_p223 had believed in [him]_p224 at the time, but now that [she]_p225 was married and full of sense [she]_p226 quite doubted whether there was any such person.",9,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Besides,"". [she]_p227 said to [Wendy]_n75 ,. ""[he]_p228 would be grown up by this time. ""Oh no, [he]_p229 isn't grown up,"". [Wendy]_n76 assured [her]_p230 confidently,. ""and [he]_p231 is just [my]_p232 size. "". [She]_p233 meant that [he]_p234 was [her]_p235 size in both mind and body [she]_p236 didn't know how [she]_p237 knew, [she]_p237 just knew it. [Mrs Darling]_n77 consulted [Mr Darling]_n78 , but [he]_p239 smiled pooh-pooh. ""Mark [my]_p240 words,"".",4,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p241 said,. ""[it]_p242 is some nonsense [Nana]_n79 has been putting into [their]_p243 heads just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave [it]_p244 alone, and [it]_p245 will blow over. But [it]_p246 would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave [Mrs Darling]_n80 quite a shock. Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For instance, [they]_p247 may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when [they]_p248 were in the wood [they]_p248 had met [their]_p250 dead father and had a game with him. [It]_p251 was in this casual way that [Wendy]_n81 one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and [Mrs Darling]_n82 was puzzling over [them]_p252 when [Wendy]_n83 said with a tolerant smile:. ""[I]_p253 do believe [it]_p254 is that [Peter]_n84 again!. ""Whatever do [you]_p255 mean, [Wendy]_n85 ?.",7,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[It]_p256 is so naughty of [him]_p257 not to wipe [his]_p258 feet,"". [Wendy]_n86 said, sighing. [She]_p259 was a tidy child. [She]_p260 explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that [she]_p261 thought [Peter]_n87 sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of [her]_p262 bed and played on [his]_p264 pipes to her. Unfortunately [she]_p265 never woke, so [she]_p266 didn't know how [she]_p266 knew, [she]_p267 just knew. ""What nonsense [you]_p269 talk, precious. No one can get into the house without knocking. ""[I]_p270 think [he]_p271 comes in by the window,"". [she]_p272 said. ""[My]_p273 love, [it]_p274 is three floors up.",2,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?   [It]_p275 was quite true the leaves had been found very near the window. [Mrs Darling]_n88 did not know what to think, for [it]_p276 all seemed so natural to [Wendy]_n89 that [you]_p278 could not dismiss [it]_p277 by saying [she]_p279 had been dreaming. ""[My]_p280 child,"". the mother cried,. ""why did [you]_p281 not tell [me]_p282 of this before?. ""[I]_p283 forgot,"". said [Wendy]_n90 lightly. [She]_p284 was in a hurry to get [her]_p285 breakfast. Oh, surely [she]_p286 must have been dreaming. But, on the other hand, there were the leaves.",3,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mrs Darling]_n91 examined [them]_p287 very carefully [they]_p288 were skeleton leaves, but [she]_p290 was sure [they]_p289 did not come from any tree that grew in [England]_n92. [She]_p291 crawled about the floor, peering at [it]_p292 with a candle for marks of a strange foot. [She]_p293 rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. [She]_p294 let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and [it]_p295 was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by. Certainly [Wendy]_n93 had been dreaming. But [Wendy]_n94 had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun. On the night [we]_p296 speak of all the children were once more in bed. [It]_p297 happened to be [Nana]_n95 's evening off, and [Mrs Darling]_n96 had bathed [them]_p298 and sung to [them]_p299 till one by one [they]_p300 had let go [her]_p301 hand and slid away into the land of sleep. All were looking so safe and cosy that [she]_p302 smiled at [her]_p303 fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew. [It]_p304 was something for [Michael]_n97 , who on [his]_p305 birthday was getting into shirts.",7,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on [Mrs Darling]_n98 's lap. Then [her]_p306 head nodded, oh, so gracefully. [She]_p307 was [asleep]_n99. Look at the four of them, [Wendy]_n100 and [Michael]_n101 over there, [John]_n102 here, and [Mrs Darling]_n103 by the fire. There should have been a fourth night-light. While [she]_p308 slept [she]_p309 had a dream. [She]_p310 dreamt that the [Neverland]_n104 had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. [He]_p311 did not alarm her, for [she]_p312 thought [she]_p313 had seen [him]_p314 before in the faces of many women who have no children. Perhaps [he]_p315 is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. But in [her]_p316 dream [he]_p317 had rent the film that obscures the [Neverland]_n105 , and [she]_p318 saw [Wendy]_n106 and [John]_n107 and [Michael]_n108 peeping through the gap.",11,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," The dream by [itself]_p319 would have been a trifle, but while [she]_p320 was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. [He]_p321 was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than [your]_p322 fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and [I]_p323 think [it]_p324 must have been this light that wakened [Mrs Darling]_n109. [She]_p325 started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow [she]_p326 knew at once that [he]_p327 was [Peter Pan]_n110. If [you]_p328 or [I]_p329 or [Wendy]_n111 had been there [we]_p330 should have seen that [he]_p331 was very like [Mrs Darling]_n112 's kiss. [He]_p332 was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about [him]_p333 was that [he]_p334 had all [his]_p335 first teeth. When [he]_p336 saw [she]_p338 was a grown-up, [he]_p337 gnashed the little pearls at her. Chapter 2 THE SHADOW [Mrs Darling]_n113 screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and [Nana]_n114 entered, returned from [her]_p339 evening out. [She]_p340 growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again [Mrs Darling]_n115 screamed, this time in distress for him, for [she]_p341 thought [he]_p346 was killed, and [she]_p342 ran down into the street to look for [his]_p347 little body, but [it]_p348 was not there and [she]_p342 looked up, and in the black night [she]_p343 could see nothing but what [she]_p343 thought was a shooting star. [She]_p349 returned to the nursery, and found [Nana]_n116 with something in [her]_p350 mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow.",8,,32,
barrie_peter_pan," As [he]_p351 leapt at the window [Nana]_n117 had closed [it]_p352 quickly, too late to catch him, but [his]_p354 shadow had not had time to get out slam went the window and snapped [it]_p353 off. [You]_p355 may be sure [Mrs Darling]_n118 examined the shadow carefully, but [it]_p356 was quite the ordinary kind. [Nana]_n119 had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. [She]_p357 hung [it]_p358 out at the window, meaning. ""[He]_p359 is sure to come back for [it]_p360 let [us]_p363 put [it]_p361 where [he]_p364 can get [it]_p361 easily without disturbing the children. But unfortunately [Mrs Darling]_n120 could not leave [it]_p365 hanging out at the window, [it]_p366 looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. [She]_p367 thought of showing [it]_p368 to [Mr Darling]_n121 , but [he]_p370 was totting up winter great-coats for [John]_n122 and [Michael]_n123 , with a wet towel around [his]_p372 head to keep [his]_p373 brain clear, and [it]_p369 seemed a shame to trouble [him]_p374 besides, [she]_p375 knew exactly what [he]_p371 would say:. ""[It]_p376 all comes of having a dog for a nurse. [She]_p377 decided to roll the shadow up and put [it]_p378 away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling [her]_p379 husband. Ah me! The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten [Friday]_n124.",8,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course [it]_p380 was a [Friday]_n125. ""[I]_p381 ought to have been specially careful on a [Friday]_n126 ,"". [she]_p382 used to say afterwards to [her]_p383 husband, while perhaps [Nana]_n127 was on the other side of her, holding [her]_p384 hand. ""No, no,"". [Mr Darling]_n128 always said,. ""[I]_p386 am responsible for [it]_p387 all. I, [George Darling]_n129 , did it. [MEA CULPA]_n130 , [MEA CULPA]_n131. "". [He]_p388 had had a classical education.",7,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p389 sat thus night after night recalling that fatal [Friday]_n132 , till every detail of [it]_p390 was stamped on [their]_p391 brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage. ""If only [I]_p392 had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,"". [Mrs Darling]_n133 said. ""If only [I]_p393 had not poured [my]_p394 medicine into [Nana]_n134 's bowl,"". said [Mr Darling]_n135. ""If only [I]_p395 had pretended to like the medicine,"". was what [Nana]_n136 's wet eyes said. ""[My]_p396 liking for parties, [George]_n137. ""[My]_p397 fatal gift of humour, dearest. ""[My]_p398 touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.",6,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," Then one or more of [them]_p399 would break down altogether [Nana]_n138 at the thought,. ""It's true, it's true, [they]_p400 ought not to have had a dog for a nurse. "". Many a time [it]_p401 was [Mr Darling]_n139 who put the handkerchief to [Nana]_n140 's eyes. ""That fiend!"". [Mr Darling]_n141 would cry, and [Nana]_n142 's bark was the echo of it, but [Mrs Darling]_n143 never upbraided [Peter]_n144 there was something in the right-hand corner of [her]_p402 mouth that wanted [her]_p403 not to call [Peter]_n145 names. [They]_p404 would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. [It]_p405 had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with [Nana]_n146 putting on the water for [Michael]_n147 's bath and carrying [him]_p406 to [it]_p407 on [her]_p408 back. ""[I]_p409 won't go to bed,"". [he]_p410 had shouted, like one who still believed that [he]_p411 had the last word on the subject,.",10,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p412 won't, [I]_p413 won't. [Nana]_n148 , [it]_p414 isn't six o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, [I]_p415 shan't love [you]_p416 any more, [Nana]_n149. [I]_p417 tell [you]_p421 [I]_p418 won't be bathed, [I]_p418 won't, [I]_p419 won't! Then [Mrs Darling]_n150 had come in, wearing [her]_p422 white evening-gown. [She]_p423 had dressed early because [Wendy]_n151 so loved to see [her]_p424 in [her]_p425 evening-gown, with the necklace [George]_n152 had given her. [She]_p427 was wearing [Wendy]_n153 's bracelet on [her]_p428 arm [she]_p429 had asked for the loan of it. [Wendy]_n154 loved to lend [her]_p430 bracelet to [her]_p431 mother. [She]_p432 had found [her]_p433 two older children playing at being [herself]_p434 and father on the occasion of [Wendy]_n155 's birth, and [John]_n156 was saying:. ""[I]_p435 am happy to inform you, [Mrs Darling]_n157 , that [you]_p436 are now a mother, in just such a tone as [Mr Darling]_n158 [himself]_p438 may have used on the real occasion. [Wendy]_n159 had danced with joy, just as the real [Mrs Darling]_n160 must have done.",13,,25,
barrie_peter_pan," Then [John]_n161 was born, with the extra pomp that [he]_p439 conceived due to the birth of a male, and [Michael]_n162 came from [his]_p440 bath to ask to be born also, but [John]_n163 said brutally that [they]_p441 did not want any more. [Michael]_n164 had nearly cried. ""Nobody wants me,"". [he]_p442 said, and of course the [lady]_n165 in the evening-dress could not stand that. ""[I]_p443 do,"". [she]_p444 said,. ""[I]_p445 so want a third child. ""[Boy]_n166 or girl?"". asked [Michael]_n167 , not too hopefully. ""[Boy]_n168.",8,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," Then [he]_p446 had leapt into [her]_p447 arms. Such a little thing for Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n169 and [Nana]_n170 to recall now, but not so little if that was to be [Michael]_n171 's last night in the nursery. [They]_p448 go on with [their]_p449 recollections. ""[It]_p450 was then that [I]_p451 rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it?"". [Mr Darling]_n172 would say, scorning [himself]_p452 and indeed [he]_p453 had been like a tornado. Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for the party, and all had gone well with [him]_p454 until [he]_p455 came to [his]_p456 tie. [It]_p457 is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though [he]_p458 knew about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of [his]_p459 tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to [him]_p460 without a contest, but there were occasions when [it]_p461 would have been better for the house if [he]_p462 had swallowed [his]_p463 pride and used a made-up tie. This was such an occasion.",4,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p464 came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in [his]_p465 hand. ""Why, what is the matter, father dear?. ""Matter!"". [he]_p466 yelled [he]_p467 really yelled. ""This tie, [it]_p468 will not tie. "". [He]_p469 became dangerously sarcastic. ""Not round [my]_p470 neck! Round the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have [I]_p472 made [it]_p473 up round the bed-post, but round [my]_p471 neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused! [He]_p474 thought [Mrs Darling]_n173 was not sufficiently impressed, and [he]_p475 went on sternly,. ""[I]_p476 warn [you]_p481 of this, mother, that unless this tie is round [my]_p483 neck [we]_p484 don't go out to dinner [to-night]_n174 , and if [I]_p477 don't go out to dinner [to-night]_n175 , [I]_p477 never go to the office again, and if [I]_p478 don't go to the office again, [you]_p482 and [I]_p478 starve, and [our]_p485 children will be flung into the streets. Even then [Mrs Darling]_n176 was placid.",4,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Let [me]_p486 try, dear,"". [she]_p487 said, and indeed that was what [he]_p489 had come to ask [her]_p490 to do, and with [her]_p491 nice cool hands [she]_p488 tied [his]_p492 tie for him, while the children stood around to see [their]_p493 fate decided. Some men would have resented [her]_p494 being able to do [it]_p496 so easily, but [Mr Darling]_n177 had far too fine a nature for that [he]_p497 thanked [her]_p495 carelessly, at once forgot [his]_p498 rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with [Michael]_n178 on [his]_p499 back. ""How wildly [we]_p500 romped!"". says [Mrs Darling]_n179 now, recalling it. ""[Our]_p501 last romp!"". [Mr Darling]_n180 groaned. ""[O George]_n181 , do [you]_p502 remember [Michael]_n182 suddenly said to me, How did [you]_p503 get to know me, mother?'. ""[I]_p504 remember!. ""[They]_p505 were rather sweet, don't [you]_p506 think, [George]_n183 ?.",7,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," ""And [they]_p507 were ours, ours! and now [they]_p508 are gone. The romp had ended with the appearance of [Nana]_n184 , and most unluckily [Mr Darling]_n185 collided against her, covering [his]_p509 trousers with hairs. [They]_p510 were not only new trousers, but [they]_p511 were the first [he]_p512 had ever had with braid on them, and [he]_p513 had had to bite [his]_p514 lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course [Mrs Darling]_n186 brushed him, but [he]_p515 began to talk again about [its]_p516 being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse. ""[George]_n187 , [Nana]_n188 is a treasure. ""No doubt, but [I]_p517 have an uneasy feeling at times that [she]_p518 looks upon the children as puppies. ""Oh no, dear one, [I]_p519 feel sure [she]_p520 knows [they]_p521 have souls. ""[I]_p522 wonder,"". [Mr Darling]_n189 said thoughtfully,. ""[I]_p523 wonder.",6,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," "". [It]_p524 was an opportunity, [his]_p525 wife felt, for telling [him]_p526 about the boy. At first [he]_p527 pooh-poohed the story, but [he]_p528 became thoughtful when [she]_p529 showed [him]_p530 the shadow. ""[It]_p531 is nobody [I]_p532 know,"". [he]_p533 said, examining [it]_p534 carefully,. ""but [it]_p535 does look a scoundrel. ""[We]_p536 were still discussing it, [you]_p537 remember,"". says [Mr Darling]_n190 ,. ""when [Nana]_n191 came in with [Michael]_n192 's medicine. [You]_p538 will never carry the bottle in [your]_p539 mouth again, [Nana]_n193 , and [it]_p540 is all [my]_p541 fault.",4,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," Strong man though [he]_p542 was, there is no doubt that [he]_p543 had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine. If [he]_p544 had a weakness, [it]_p547 was for thinking that all [his]_p548 life [he]_p545 had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when [Michael]_n194 dodged the spoon in [Nana]_n195 's mouth, [he]_p545 had said reprovingly,. ""Be a man, [Michael]_n196. ""Won't won't!"". [Michael]_n197 cried naughtily. [Mrs Darling]_n198 left the room to get a chocolate for him, and [Mr Darling]_n199 thought this showed want of firmness. ""[Mother]_n200 , don't pamper him,"". [he]_p549 called after her. ""[Michael]_n201 , when [I]_p550 was [your]_p552 age [I]_p551 took medicine without a murmur. [I]_p553 said, Thank you, kind parents, for giving [me]_p554 bottles to make [me]_p555 well.",8,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ' [He]_p556 really thought this was true, and [Wendy]_n202 , who was now in [her]_p557 night-gown, believed [it]_p558 also, and [she]_p559 said, to encourage [Michael]_n203 ,. ""That medicine [you]_p560 sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't it?. ""Ever so much nastier,"". [Mr Darling]_n204 said bravely,. ""and [I]_p561 would take [it]_p563 now as an example to you, [Michael]_n205 , if [I]_p562 hadn't lost the bottle. [He]_p564 had not exactly lost [it]_p565 [he]_p567 had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden [it]_p566 there. What [he]_p568 did not know was that the faithful [Liza]_n206 had found it, and put [it]_p569 back on [his]_p571 wash-stand. ""[I]_p572 know where [it]_p573 is, father,"". [Wendy]_n207 cried, always glad to be of service. ""I'll bring it,"".",6,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," and [she]_p574 was off before [he]_p575 could stop her. Immediately [his]_p576 spirits sank in the strangest way. ""[John]_n208 ,"". [he]_p577 said, shuddering,. ""it's most beastly stuff. It's that nasty, sticky, sweet kind. ""[It]_p578 will soon be over, father,"". [John]_n209 said cheerily, and then in rushed [Wendy]_n210 with the medicine in a glass. ""[I]_p579 have been as quick as [I]_p580 could,"". [she]_p581 panted.",3,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[You]_p582 have been wonderfully quick,"". [her]_p583 father retorted, with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. ""[Michael]_n211 first,"". [he]_p585 said doggedly. ""[Father]_n212 first,"". said [Michael]_n213 , who was of a suspicious nature. ""[I]_p586 shall be sick, [you]_p587 know,"". [Mr Darling]_n214 said threateningly. ""Come on, father,"". said [John]_n215.",5,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Hold [your]_p588 tongue, [John]_n216 ,"". [his]_p589 father rapped out. [Wendy]_n217 was quite puzzled. ""[I]_p590 thought [you]_p591 took [it]_p592 quite easily, father. ""That is not the point,"". [he]_p593 retorted. ""The point is, that there is more in [my]_p594 glass than in [Michael]_n218 's spoon. "". [His]_p595 proud heart was nearly bursting. ""And [it]_p596 isn't fair: [I]_p600 would say [it]_p597 though [it]_p597 were with [my]_p601 last breath [it]_p598 isn't fair.",3,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Father]_n219 , [I]_p602 am waiting,"". said [Michael]_n220 coldly. ""It's all very well to say [you]_p603 are waiting so am [I]_p604 waiting. ""[Father]_n221 's a cowardly custard. ""So are [you]_p605 a cowardly custard. ""I'm not frightened. ""Neither am [I]_p606 frightened. ""Well, then, take it. ""Well, then, [you]_p607 take it. [Wendy]_n222 had a splendid idea.",4,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Why not both take [it]_p608 at the same time?. ""Certainly,"". said [Mr Darling]_n223. ""Are [you]_p609 ready, [Michael]_n224 ? [Wendy]_n225 gave the words, one, two, three, and [Michael]_n226 took [his]_p610 medicine, but [Mr Darling]_n227 slipped [his]_p611 behind [his]_p611 back. There was a yell of rage from [Michael]_n228 , and. ""O father!"". [Wendy]_n229 exclaimed. ""What do [you]_p613 mean by O father'?"". [Mr Darling]_n230 demanded. ""Stop that row, [Michael]_n231.",9,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [I]_p614 meant to take mine, but I, [I]_p615 missed it. [It]_p617 was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if [they]_p618 did not admire him. ""Look here, all of you,"". [he]_p619 said entreatingly, as soon as [Nana]_n232 had gone into the bathroom. ""[I]_p620 have just thought of a splendid joke. [I]_p621 shall pour [my]_p622 medicine into [Nana]_n233 's bowl, and [she]_p623 will drink it, thinking [it]_p624 is milk! [It]_p626 was the colour of milk but the children did not have [their]_p627 father's sense of humour, and [they]_p628 looked at [him]_p629 reproachfully as [he]_p630 poured the medicine into [Nana]_n234 's bowl. ""What fun!"". [he]_p631 said doubtfully, and [they]_p632 did not dare expose [him]_p633 when [Mrs Darling]_n235 and [Nana]_n236 returned. ""[Nana]_n237 , good dog,"". [he]_p634 said, patting her,.",6,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p635 have put a little milk into [your]_p636 bowl, [Nana]_n238. [Nana]_n239 wagged [her]_p637 tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then [she]_p638 gave [Mr Darling]_n240 such a look, not an angry look: [she]_p639 showed [him]_p640 the great red tear that makes [us]_p641 so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into [her]_p642 kennel. [Mr Darling]_n241 was frightfully ashamed of himself, but [he]_p643 would not give in. In a horrid silence [Mrs Darling]_n242 smelt the bowl. ""[O George]_n243 ,"". [she]_p644 said,. ""it's [your]_p645 medicine!. ""[It]_p646 was only a joke,"". [he]_p647 roared, while [she]_p648 comforted [her]_p649 boys, and [Wendy]_n244 hugged [Nana]_n245.",8,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Much good,"". [he]_p650 said bitterly,. ""[my]_p651 wearing [myself]_p652 to the bone trying to be funny in this house. And still [Wendy]_n246 hugged [Nana]_n247. ""That's right,"". [he]_p653 shouted. ""Coddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! [I]_p654 am only the breadwinner, why should [I]_p655 be coddled, why, why, why!. ""[George]_n248 ,"". [Mrs Darling]_n249 entreated him,.",4,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""not so loud the servants will hear you. "". Somehow [they]_p656 had got into the way of calling [Liza]_n250 the servants. ""Let them!"". [he]_p657 answered recklessly. ""[Bring]_n251 in the whole world. But [I]_p658 refuse to allow that dog to lord [it]_p659 in [my]_p660 nursery for an hour longer. The children wept, and [Nana]_n252 ran to [him]_p661 beseechingly, but [he]_p662 waved [her]_p663 back. [He]_p664 felt [he]_p665 was a strong man again. ""In vain, in vain,"".",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p666 cried. ""the proper place for [you]_p667 is the yard, and there [you]_p668 go to be tied up this instant. ""[George]_n253 , [George]_n254 ,"". [Mrs Darling]_n255 whispered,. ""remember what [I]_p669 told [you]_p670 about that boy. Alas, [he]_p671 would not listen. [He]_p672 was determined to show who was master in that house, and when commands would not draw [Nana]_n256 from the kennel, [he]_p673 lured [her]_p674 out of [it]_p677 with honeyed words, and seizing [her]_p675 roughly, dragged [her]_p675 from the nursery. [He]_p678 was ashamed of himself, and yet [he]_p679 did it. [It]_p680 was all owing to [his]_p681 too affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When [he]_p682 had tied [her]_p683 up in the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with [his]_p684 knuckles to [his]_p685 eyes.",4,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," In the meantime [Mrs Darling]_n257 had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit [their]_p686 night-lights. [They]_p687 could hear [Nana]_n258 barking, and [John]_n259 whimpered,. ""[It]_p688 is because [he]_p689 is chaining [her]_p690 up in the yard,"". but [Wendy]_n260 was wiser. ""That is not [Nana]_n261 's unhappy bark,"". [she]_p691 said, little guessing what was about to happen. ""that is [her]_p692 bark when [she]_p693 smells danger. Danger!. ""Are [you]_p694 sure, [Wendy]_n262 ?. ""Oh, yes.",6,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mrs Darling]_n263 quivered and went to the window. [It]_p695 was securely fastened. [She]_p696 looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. [They]_p697 were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but [she]_p698 did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at [her]_p699 heart and made [her]_p700 cry,. ""Oh, how [I]_p701 wish that [I]_p702 wasn't going to a party [to-night]_n264 ! Even [Michael]_n265 , already half [asleep]_n266 , knew that [she]_p703 was perturbed, and [he]_p704 asked,. ""Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?. ""Nothing, precious,"". [she]_p705 said. ""[they]_p706 are the eyes a mother leaves behind [her]_p707 to guard [her]_p708 children.",4,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p709 went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little [Michael]_n267 flung [his]_p710 arms round her. ""[Mother]_n268 ,"". [he]_p711 cried,. ""I'm glad of you. [They]_p712 were the last words [she]_p713 was to hear from [him]_p714 for a long time. No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow, and [Father]_n269 and [Mother Darling]_n270 picked [their]_p715 way over [it]_p717 deftly not to soil [their]_p716 shoes. [They]_p718 were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but [they]_p719 may not take an active part in anything, [they]_p720 must just look on for ever. [It]_p721 is a punishment put on [them]_p722 for something [they]_p723 did so long ago that no star now knows what [it]_p724 was.",4,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little ones still wonder. [They]_p725 are not really friendly to [Peter]_n271 , who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind [them]_p726 and trying to blow [them]_p727 out but [they]_p728 are so fond of fun that [they]_p729 were on [his]_p730 side [to-night]_n272 , and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n273 there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the [Milky Way]_n274 screamed out:. ""Now, [Peter]_n275 ! Chapter 3 [COME]_n276 AWAY, [COME]_n277 AWAY! For a moment after Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n278 left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. [They]_p731 were awfully nice little night-lights, and [one]_p732 cannot help wishing that [they]_p733 could have kept awake to see [Peter]_n279 but [Wendy]_n280 's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before [they]_p734 could close [their]_p735 mouths all the three went out. There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time [we]_p736 have taken to say this, [it]_p737 had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for [Peter]_n281 's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. [It]_p738 was not really a light [it]_p739 made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when [it]_p740 came to rest for a second [you]_p742 saw [it]_p740 was a fairy, no longer than [your]_p743 hand, but still growing. [It]_p744 was a girl called [Tinker Bell]_n282 exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which [her]_p745 figure could be seen to the best advantage. [She]_p746 was slightly inclined to [EMBONPOINT]_n283. [plump hourglass figure] A moment after the fairy's entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars, and [Peter]_n284 dropped in.",14,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p747 had carried [Tinker Bell]_n285 part of the way, and [his]_p748 hand was still messy with the fairy dust. ""[Tinker Bell]_n286 ,"". [he]_p749 called softly, after making sure that the children were [asleep]_n287 ,. ""[Tink]_n288 , where are you?"". [She]_p750 was in a jug for the moment, and liking [it]_p751 extremely [she]_p752 had never been in a jug before. ""Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do [you]_p753 know where [they]_p754 put [my]_p755 shadow?   The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. [It]_p756 is the fairy language. [You]_p757 ordinary children can never hear it, but if [you]_p761 were to hear [it]_p758 [you]_p762 would know that [you]_p762 had heard [it]_p759 once before. [Tink]_n289 said that the shadow was in the big box. [She]_p764 meant the chest of drawers, and [Peter]_n290 jumped at the drawers, scattering [their]_p765 contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha'pence to the crowd.",6,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," In a moment [he]_p766 had recovered [his]_p769 shadow, and in [his]_p770 delight [he]_p767 forgot that [he]_p767 had shut [Tinker Bell]_n291 up in the drawer. If [he]_p771 thought at all, but [I]_p775 don't believe [he]_p772 ever thought, [it]_p776 was that [he]_p772 and [his]_p777 shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water, and when [they]_p778 did not [he]_p773 was appalled. [He]_p779 tried to stick [it]_p780 on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through [Peter]_n292 , and [he]_p781 sat on the floor and cried. [His]_p782 sobs woke [Wendy]_n293 , and [she]_p783 sat up in bed. [She]_p784 was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor [she]_p785 was only pleasantly interested. ""[Boy]_n294 ,"". [she]_p786 said courteously,. ""why are [you]_p787 crying? [Peter]_n295 could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies, and [he]_p788 rose and bowed to [her]_p789 beautifully. [She]_p790 was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to [him]_p791 from the bed.",5,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," ""What's [your]_p792 name?"". [he]_p793 asked. ""[Wendy Moira Angela Darling]_n296 ,"". [she]_p794 replied with some satisfaction. ""What is [your]_p795 name?. ""[Peter Pan]_n297. [She]_p796 was already sure that [he]_p797 must be [Peter]_n298 , but [it]_p798 did seem a comparatively short name. ""Is that all?. ""Yes,"". [he]_p799 said rather sharply.",3,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p800 felt for the first time that [it]_p801 was a shortish name. ""I'm so sorry,"". said [Wendy Moira Angela]_n299. ""[It]_p802 doesn't matter,"". [Peter]_n300 gulped. [She]_p803 asked where [he]_p804 lived. ""Second to the right,"". said [Peter]_n301 ,. ""and then straight on till morning. ""What a funny address! [Peter]_n302 had a sinking.",4,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," For the first time [he]_p805 felt that perhaps [it]_p806 was a funny address. ""No, [it]_p807 isn't,"". [he]_p808 said. ""[I]_p809 mean,"". [Wendy]_n303 said nicely, remembering that [she]_p810 was hostess,. ""is that what [they]_p811 put on the letters?   [He]_p812 wished [she]_p813 had not mentioned letters. ""Don't get any letters,"". [he]_p814 said contemptuously. ""But [your]_p815 mother gets letters?. ""Don't have a mother,"".",1,,11,

[Wendy]_n304 , however, felt at once that [she]_p821 was in the presence of a tragedy. ""[O Peter]_n305 , no wonder [you]_p822 were crying,"". [she]_p823 said, and got out of bed and ran to him. ""[I]_p824 wasn't crying about mothers,"". [he]_p825 said rather indignantly. ""[I]_p826 was crying because [I]_p827 can't get [my]_p828 shadow to stick on. Besides, [I]_p829 wasn't crying.",2,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[It]_p830 has come off?. ""Yes. Then [Wendy]_n306 saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and [she]_p831 was frightfully sorry for [Peter]_n307. ""How awful!"". [she]_p832 said, but [she]_p833 could not help smiling when [she]_p833 saw that [he]_p835 had been trying to stick [it]_p836 on with soap. How exactly like a boy!  Fortunately [she]_p837 knew at once what to do. ""[It]_p838 must be sewn on,"". [she]_p839 said, just a little patronisingly. ""What's sewn?"". [he]_p840 asked.",2,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," ""You're dreadfully ignorant. ""No, I'm not. But [she]_p841 was exulting in [his]_p842 ignorance. ""[I]_p843 shall sew [it]_p844 on for you, [my]_p845 little man,"". [she]_p846 said, though [he]_p848 was tall as herself, and [she]_p847 got out [her]_p849 housewife [sewing bag], and sewed the shadow on to [Peter]_n308 's foot. ""[I]_p850 daresay [it]_p851 will hurt a little,"". [she]_p852 warned him. ""Oh, [I]_p853 shan't cry,"". said [Peter]_n309 , who was already of the opinion that [he]_p854 had never cried in [his]_p855 life. And [he]_p856 clenched [his]_p857 teeth and did not cry, and soon [his]_p858 shadow was behaving properly, though still a little creased.",2,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Perhaps [I]_p859 should have ironed it,"". [Wendy]_n310 said thoughtfully, but [Peter]_n311 , [boylike]_n312 , was indifferent to appearances, and [he]_p860 was now jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, [he]_p861 had already forgotten that [he]_p862 owed [his]_p863 bliss to [Wendy]_n313. [He]_p864 thought [he]_p865 had attached the shadow himself. ""How clever [I]_p866 am!"". [he]_p867 crowed rapturously,. ""oh, the cleverness of me! [It]_p868 is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of [Peter]_n314 was one of [his]_p869 most fascinating qualities. To put [it]_p870 with brutal frankness, there never was a cockier boy. But for the moment [Wendy]_n315 was shocked. ""[You]_p871 conceit [braggart],"".",6,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p872 exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm. ""of course [I]_p873 did nothing!. ""[You]_p874 did a little,"". [Peter]_n316 said carelessly, and continued to dance. ""A little!"". [she]_p875 replied with hauteur [pride]. ""if [I]_p876 am no use [I]_p877 can at least withdraw,"". and [she]_p878 sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered [her]_p879 face with the blankets. To induce [her]_p880 to look up [he]_p882 pretended to be going away, and when this failed [he]_p883 sat on the end of the bed and tapped [her]_p881 gently with [his]_p884 foot. ""[Wendy]_n317 ,"".",2,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p885 said,. ""don't withdraw. [I]_p886 can't help crowing, [Wendy]_n318 , when I'm pleased with myself. "". Still [she]_p888 would not look up, though [she]_p889 was listening eagerly. ""[Wendy]_n319 ,"". [he]_p890 continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist,. ""[Wendy]_n320 , one girl is more use than twenty boys. Now [Wendy]_n321 was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, and [she]_p891 peeped out of the bed-clothes.

barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes, [I]_p893 do. ""[I]_p894 think it's perfectly sweet of you,"". [she]_p895 declared,. ""and I'll get up again,"". and [she]_p896 sat with [him]_p897 on the side of the bed. [She]_p898 also said [she]_p899 would give [him]_p901 a kiss if [he]_p902 liked, but [Peter]_n323 did not know what [she]_p900 meant, and [he]_p903 held out [his]_p904 hand expectantly. ""Surely [you]_p905 know what a kiss is?"". [she]_p906 asked, aghast. ""[I]_p907 shall know when [you]_p908 give [it]_p909 to me,"". [he]_p910 replied stiffly, and not to hurt [his]_p911 feeling [she]_p912 gave [him]_p913 a thimble.",1,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Now,"". said he,. ""shall [I]_p914 give [you]_p915 a kiss?"". and [she]_p916 replied with a slight primness,. ""If [you]_p917 please. "". [She]_p918 made [herself]_p919 rather cheap by inclining [her]_p920 face toward him, but [he]_p924 merely dropped an acorn button into [her]_p921 hand, so [she]_p925 slowly returned [her]_p921 face to where [it]_p927 had been before, and said nicely that [she]_p926 would wear [his]_p928 kiss on the chain around [her]_p922 neck. [It]_p929 was lucky that [she]_p930 did put [it]_p931 on that chain, for [it]_p932 was afterwards to save [her]_p933 life. When people in [our]_p934 set are introduced, [it]_p935 is customary for [them]_p936 to ask each other's age, and so [Wendy]_n324 , who always liked to do the correct thing, asked [Peter]_n325 how old [he]_p937 was. [It]_p938 was not really a happy question to ask [him]_p939 [it]_p940 was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what [you]_p941 want to be asked is Kings of [England]_n326.",3,,28,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p942 don't know,"". [he]_p943 replied uneasily,. ""but [I]_p944 am quite young. "". [He]_p945 really knew nothing about it, [he]_p946 had merely suspicions, but [he]_p947 said at a venture,. ""[Wendy]_n327 , [I]_p948 ran away the day [I]_p949 was born. [Wendy]_n328 was quite surprised, but interested and [she]_p950 indicated in the charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on [her]_p951 night-gown, that [he]_p953 could sit nearer her. ""[It]_p954 was because [I]_p955 heard father and mother,"". [he]_p956 explained in a low voice,. ""talking about what [I]_p957 was to be when [I]_p958 became a man.",2,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," "". [He]_p959 was extraordinarily agitated now. ""[I]_p960 don't want ever to be a man,"". [he]_p961 said with passion. ""[I]_p962 want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So [I]_p963 ran away to [Kensington Gardens]_n329 and lived a long long time among the fairies. [She]_p964 gave [him]_p965 a look of the most intense admiration, and [he]_p966 thought [it]_p969 was because [he]_p967 had run away, but [it]_p970 was really because [he]_p967 knew fairies. [Wendy]_n330 had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck [her]_p971 as quite delightful. [She]_p972 poured out questions about them, to [his]_p975 surprise, for [they]_p977 were rather a nuisance to him, getting in [his]_p976 way and so on, and indeed [he]_p978 sometimes had to give [them]_p973 a hiding [spanking]. Still, [he]_p979 liked [them]_p981 on the whole, and [he]_p980 told [her]_p982 about the beginning of fairies.",2,,23,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[You]_p983 see, [Wendy]_n331 , when the first baby laughed for the first time, [its]_p984 laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and [they]_p985 all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies.

""No. [You]_p988 see children know such a lot now, [they]_p989 soon don't believe in fairies, and every time a child says, [I]_p990 don't believe in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead. Really, [he]_p991 thought [they]_p992 had now talked enough about fairies, and [it]_p993 struck [him]_p994 that [Tinker Bell]_n332 was keeping very quiet. ""[I]_p995 can't think where [she]_p996 has gone to,"".",2,,14,

""[you]_p1000 don't mean to tell [me]_p1001 that there is a fairy in this room!. ""[She]_p1002 was here just now,"". [he]_p1003 said a little impatiently.

[He]_p1011 had [his]_p1012 first laugh still. ""[Wendy]_n340 ,"". [he]_p1013 whispered gleefully,. ""[I]_p1014 do believe [I]_p1015 shut [her]_p1016 up in the drawer!

barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p1242 showed [them]_p1243 again. ""You're so nippy at it,"". [John]_n443 said,. ""couldn't [you]_p1244 do [it]_p1245 very slowly once? [Peter]_n444 did [it]_p1246 both slowly and quickly. ""I've got [it]_p1247 now, [Wendy]_n445 !"". cried [John]_n446 , but soon [he]_p1248 found [he]_p1249 had not. Not one of [them]_p1250 could fly an inch, though even [Michael]_n447 was in words of two syllables, and [Peter]_n448 did not know A from Z. Of course [Peter]_n449 had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as [we]_p1251 have mentioned, one of [his]_p1252 hands was messy with it, and [he]_p1253 blew some on each of them, with the most superb results. ""Now just wiggle [your]_p1254 shoulders this way,"".",7,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p1255 said,. ""and let go. [They]_p1256 were all on [their]_p1257 beds, and gallant [Michael]_n450 let go first. [He]_p1258 did not quite mean to let go, but [he]_p1259 did it, and immediately [he]_p1260 was borne across the room. ""[I]_p1261 flewed!"". [he]_p1262 screamed while still in mid-air. [John]_n451 let go and met [Wendy]_n452 near the bathroom. ""Oh, lovely!. ""Oh, ripping!. ""Look at me!.",3,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Look at me!. ""Look at me! [They]_p1263 were not nearly so elegant as [Peter]_n453 , [they]_p1264 could not help kicking a little, but [their]_p1265 heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing so delicious as that. [Peter]_n454 gave [Wendy]_n455 a hand at first, but had to desist, [Tink]_n456 was so indignant. Up and down [they]_p1266 went, and round and round. Heavenly was [Wendy]_n457 's word. ""[I]_p1267 say,"". cried [John]_n458 ,. ""why shouldn't [we]_p1268 all go out? Of course [it]_p1269 was to this that [Peter]_n459 had been luring them. [Michael]_n460 was ready: [he]_p1270 wanted to see how long [it]_p1271 took [him]_p1272 to do a billion miles. But [Wendy]_n461 hesitated.",9,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Mermaids!"". said [Peter]_n462 again. ""Oo!. ""And there are pirates. ""Pirates,"". cried [John]_n463 , seizing [his]_p1273 [Sunday]_n464 hat,. ""let [us]_p1274 go at once. [It]_p1275 was just at this moment that Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n465 hurried with [Nana]_n466 out of 27. [They]_p1276 ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window and, yes, [it]_p1277 was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, [they]_p1278 could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the floor but in the air. Not three figures, four!  In a tremble [they]_p1279 opened the street door.",5,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mr Darling]_n467 would have rushed upstairs, but [Mrs Darling]_n468 signed [him]_p1280 to go softly. [She]_p1281 even tried to make [her]_p1282 heart go softly. Will [they]_p1283 reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and [we]_p1284 shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On the other hand, if [they]_p1285 are not in time, [I]_p1286 solemnly promise that [it]_p1287 will all come right in the end. [They]_p1288 would have reached the nursery in time had [it]_p1289 not been that the little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window open, and that smallest star of all called out:. ""[Cave]_n469 , [Peter]_n470 ! Then [Peter]_n471 knew that there was not a moment to lose. ""Come,"". [he]_p1290 cried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by [John]_n472 and [Michael]_n473 and [Wendy]_n474. Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n475 and [Nana]_n476 rushed into the nursery too late.",10,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," The birds were flown. Chapter 4 THE FLIGHT. ""Second to the right, and straight on till morning. That, Peter had told [Wendy]_n477 , was the way to the [Neverland]_n478 but even birds, carrying maps and consulting [them]_p1291 at windy corners, could not have sighted [it]_p1292 with these instructions. [Peter]_n479 , [you]_p1293 see, just said anything that came into [his]_p1294 head. At first [his]_p1295 companions trusted [him]_p1296 implicitly, and so great were the delights of flying that [they]_p1297 wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took [their]_p1298 fancy. [John]_n480 and [Michael]_n481 raced, [Michael]_n482 getting a start. [They]_p1299 recalled with contempt that not so long ago [they]_p1300 had thought [themselves]_p1301 fine fellows for being able to fly round a room. Not long ago. But how long ago? [They]_p1302 were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb [Wendy]_n483 seriously.",7,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [John]_n484 thought [it]_p1303 was [their]_p1304 second sea and [their]_p1305 third night. Sometimes [it]_p1306 was dark and sometimes light, and now [they]_p1307 were very cold and again too warm. Did [they]_p1308 really feel hungry at times, or were [they]_p1309 merely pretending, because [Peter]_n485 had such a jolly new way of feeding them? [His]_p1313 way was to pursue birds who had food in [their]_p1314 mouths suitable for humans and snatch [it]_p1315 from [them]_p1311 then the birds would follow and snatch [it]_p1316 back and [they]_p1309 would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But [Wendy]_n486 noticed with gentle concern that [Peter]_n487 did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting [your]_p1317 bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways. Certainly [they]_p1318 did not pretend to be sleepy, [they]_p1319 were sleepy and that was a danger, for the moment [they]_p1319 popped off, down [they]_p1320 fell. The awful thing was that [Peter]_n488 thought this funny. ""There [he]_p1322 goes again!"". [he]_p1323 would cry gleefully, as [Michael]_n489 suddenly dropped like a stone. ""Save him, save him!"". cried [Wendy]_n490 , looking with horror at the cruel sea far below.",7,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," Eventually [Peter]_n491 would dive through the air, and catch [Michael]_n492 just before [he]_p1324 could strike the sea, and [it]_p1327 was lovely the way [he]_p1325 did [it]_p1328 but [he]_p1325 always waited till the last moment, and [you]_p1330 felt [it]_p1328 was [his]_p1331 cleverness that interested [him]_p1332 and not the saving of human life. Also [he]_p1333 was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed [him]_p1335 one moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility that the next time [you]_p1337 fell [he]_p1334 would let [you]_p1338 go. [He]_p1339 could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on [his]_p1340 back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because [he]_p1341 was so light that if [you]_p1343 got behind [him]_p1344 and blew [he]_p1342 went faster. ""Do be more polite to him,"". [Wendy]_n493 whispered to [John]_n494 , when [they]_p1345 were playing. ""Follow [my]_p1346 [Leader]_n495. ""Then tell [him]_p1347 to stop showing off,"". said [John]_n496. When playing Follow [my]_p1348 [Leader]_n497 , [Peter]_n498 would fly close to the water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street [you]_p1349 may run [your]_p1350 finger along an iron railing. [They]_p1351 could not follow [him]_p1352 in this with much success, so perhaps [it]_p1353 was rather like showing off, especially as [he]_p1354 kept looking behind to see how many tails [they]_p1355 missed.",8,,31,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[You]_p1356 must be nice to him,"". [Wendy]_n499 impressed on [her]_p1357 brothers. ""What could [we]_p1358 do if [he]_p1359 were to leave us!. ""[We]_p1360 could go back,"". [Michael]_n500 said. ""How could [we]_p1361 ever find [our]_p1362 way back without him?. ""Well, then, [we]_p1363 could go on,"". said [John]_n501. ""That is the awful thing, [John]_n502. [We]_p1364 should have to go on, for [we]_p1365 don't know how to stop.",4,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," This was true, [Peter]_n503 had forgotten to show [them]_p1366 how to stop. [John]_n504 said that if the worst came to the worst, all [they]_p1367 had to do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time [they]_p1368 must come back to [their]_p1369 own window. ""And who is to get food for us, [John]_n505 ?. ""[I]_p1370 nipped a bit out of that eagle's mouth pretty neatly, [Wendy]_n506. ""After the twentieth try,"". [Wendy]_n507 reminded him. ""And even though [we]_p1371 became good at picking up food, see how [we]_p1372 bump against clouds and things if [he]_p1373 is not near to give [us]_p1374 a hand. Indeed [they]_p1375 were constantly bumping. [They]_p1376 could now fly strongly, though [they]_p1377 still kicked far too much but if [they]_p1378 saw a cloud in front of them, the more [they]_p1378 tried to avoid it, the more certainly did [they]_p1379 bump into it. If [Nana]_n508 had been with them, [she]_p1381 would have had a bandage round [Michael]_n509 's forehead by this time.",7,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n510 was not with [them]_p1382 for the moment, and [they]_p1383 felt rather lonely up there by themselves. [He]_p1384 could go so much faster than [they]_p1385 that [he]_p1387 would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which [they]_p1386 had no share. [He]_p1388 would come down laughing over something fearfully funny [he]_p1389 had been saying to a star, but [he]_p1390 had already forgotten what [it]_p1392 was, or [he]_p1390 would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening. [It]_p1393 was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid. ""And if [he]_p1394 forgets [them]_p1395 so quickly,"". [Wendy]_n511 argued,. ""how can [we]_p1396 expect that [he]_p1397 will go on remembering us?   Indeed, sometimes when [he]_p1398 returned [he]_p1398 did not remember them, at least not well. [Wendy]_n512 was sure of it. [She]_p1400 saw recognition come into [his]_p1401 eyes as [he]_p1402 was about to pass [them]_p1403 the time of day and go on once even [she]_p1404 had to call [him]_p1405 by name. ""I'm [Wendy]_n513 ,"".",4,,24,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p1406 said agitatedly. [He]_p1407 was very sorry. ""[I]_p1408 say, [Wendy]_n514 ,"". [he]_p1409 whispered to her,. ""always if [you]_p1410 see [me]_p1412 forgetting you, just keep on saying I'm [Wendy]_n515 ,' and then I'll remember. Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends [he]_p1413 showed [them]_p1414 how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going [their]_p1415 way, and this was such a pleasant change that [they]_p1416 tried [it]_p1418 several times and found that [they]_p1417 could sleep thus with security. Indeed [they]_p1419 would have slept longer, but [Peter]_n516 tired quickly of sleeping, and soon [he]_p1420 would cry in [his]_p1421 captain voice,. ""[We]_p1422 get off here. "".",3,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, [they]_p1423 drew near the [Neverland]_n517 for after many moons [they]_p1424 did reach it, and, what is more, [they]_p1424 had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or [Tink]_n518 as because the island was looking for them. [It]_p1426 is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores. ""There [it]_p1427 is,"". said [Peter]_n519 calmly. ""Where, where?. ""Where all the arrows are pointing. Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing [it]_p1428 out to the children, all directed by [their]_p1429 friend the sun, who wanted [them]_p1431 to be sure of [their]_p1430 way before leaving [them]_p1432 for the night. [Wendy]_n520 and [John]_n521 and [Michael]_n522 stood on tip-toe in the air to get [their]_p1433 first sight of the island. Strange to say, [they]_p1434 all recognized [it]_p1437 at once, and until fear fell upon [them]_p1439 [they]_p1435 hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom [they]_p1435 were returning home for the holidays. ""[John]_n523 , there's the lagoon.",7,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Wendy]_n524 , look at the turtles burying [their]_p1440 eggs in the sand. ""[I]_p1441 say, [John]_n525 , [I]_p1442 see [your]_p1443 flamingo with the broken leg!. ""Look, [Michael]_n526 , there's [your]_p1444 cave!. ""[John]_n527 , what's that in the brushwood?. ""It's a wolf with [her]_p1445 whelps. [Wendy]_n528 , [I]_p1446 do believe that's [your]_p1447 little whelp!. ""There's [my]_p1448 boat, [John]_n529 , with [her]_p1449 sides stove in!. ""No, [it]_p1450 isn't. Why, [we]_p1451 burned [your]_p1452 boat. ""That's her, at any rate.",6,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [I]_p1453 say, [John]_n530 , [I]_p1454 see the smoke of the redskin camp!. ""Where? Show me, and I'll tell [you]_p1455 by the way smoke curls whether [they]_p1456 are on the war-path. ""There, just across the [Mysterious River]_n531. ""[I]_p1457 see now. Yes, [they]_p1458 are on the war-path right enough. [Peter]_n532 was a little annoyed with [them]_p1459 for knowing so much, but if [he]_p1462 wanted to lord [it]_p1463 over [them]_p1460 [his]_p1464 triumph was at hand, for have [I]_p1465 not told [you]_p1466 that anon fear fell upon them? [It]_p1467 came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom. In the old days at home the [Neverland]_n533 had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in [it]_p1468 and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, [you]_p1469 lost the certainty that [you]_p1470 would win. [You]_p1471 were quite glad that the night-lights were on. [You]_p1472 even liked [Nana]_n534 to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the [Neverland]_n535 was all make-believe.",6,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course the [Neverland]_n536 had been make-believe in those days, but [it]_p1473 was real now, and there were no night-lights, and [it]_p1474 was getting darker every moment, and where was [Nana]_n537 ? [They]_p1475 had been flying apart, but [they]_p1476 huddled close to Peter now. [His]_p1477 careless manner had gone at last, [his]_p1478 eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through [them]_p1480 every time [they]_p1481 touched [his]_p1479 body. [They]_p1482 were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed [their]_p1483 feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet [their]_p1484 progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if [they]_p1486 were pushing [their]_p1485 way through hostile forces. Sometimes [they]_p1487 hung in the air until [Peter]_n538 had beaten on [it]_p1488 with [his]_p1489 fists. ""[They]_p1490 don't want [us]_p1491 to land,"". [he]_p1492 explained. ""Who are they?"". [Wendy]_n539 whispered, shuddering. But [he]_p1493 could not or would not say.",4,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," [Tinker Bell]_n540 had been [asleep]_n541 on [his]_p1494 shoulder, but now [he]_p1495 wakened [her]_p1496 and sent [her]_p1497 on in front. Sometimes [he]_p1498 poised [himself]_p1500 in the air, listening intently, with [his]_p1501 hand to [his]_p1502 ear, and again [he]_p1499 would stare down with eyes so bright that [they]_p1503 seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, [he]_p1504 went on again. [His]_p1505 courage was almost appalling. ""Would [you]_p1506 like an adventure now,"". [he]_p1507 said casually to [John]_n542 ,. ""or would [you]_p1508 like to have [your]_p1509 tea first? [Wendy]_n543 said. ""tea first"". quickly, and [Michael]_n544 pressed [her]_p1510 hand in gratitude, but the braver [John]_n545 hesitated. ""What kind of adventure?"".",6,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p1511 asked cautiously. ""There's a pirate [asleep]_n546 in the pampas just beneath us,"". [Peter]_n547 told him. ""If [you]_p1512 like, we'll go down and kill him. ""[I]_p1513 don't see him,"". [John]_n548 said after a long pause. ""[I]_p1514 do. ""Suppose,"". [John]_n549 said, a little huskily,. ""[he]_p1515 were to wake up.",4,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n550 spoke indignantly. ""[You]_p1516 don't think [I]_p1517 would kill [him]_p1519 while [he]_p1522 was sleeping! [I]_p1518 would wake [him]_p1520 first, and then kill him. That's the way [I]_p1523 always do. ""[I]_p1524 say! Do [you]_p1525 kill many?. ""Tons. [John]_n551 said. ""How ripping,"". but decided to have tea first. [He]_p1526 asked if there were many pirates on the island just now, and [Peter]_n552 said [he]_p1527 had never known so many. ""Who is captain now?.",3,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Hook]_n553 ,"". answered [Peter]_n554 , and [his]_p1528 face became very stern as [he]_p1529 said that hated word. ""[Jas]_n555. [Hook]_n556 ?. ""Ay. Then indeed [Michael]_n557 began to cry, and even [John]_n558 could speak in gulps only, for [they]_p1530 knew [Hook]_n559 's reputation. ""[He]_p1531 was [Blackbeard]_n560 's bo'sun,"". [John]_n561 whispered huskily. ""[He]_p1532 is the worst of [them]_p1533 all. [He]_p1534 is the only man of whom [Barbecue]_n562 was afraid.",10,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""That's him,"". said [Peter]_n563. ""What is [he]_p1535 like? Is [he]_p1536 big?. ""[He]_p1537 is not so big as [he]_p1538 was. ""How do [you]_p1539 mean?. ""[I]_p1540 cut off a bit of him. ""You!. ""Yes, me,"". said [Peter]_n564 sharply. ""[I]_p1541 wasn't meaning to be disrespectful.",2,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Oh, all right. ""But, [I]_p1542 say, what bit?. ""[His]_p1543 right hand. ""Then [he]_p1544 can't fight now?. ""Oh, can't [he]_p1545 just!. ""Left-hander?. ""[He]_p1546 has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and [he]_p1547 claws with it. ""Claws!. ""[I]_p1548 say, [John]_n565 ,"". said [Peter]_n566.",2,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes. ""Say, Ay, ay, sir. '. ""Ay, ay, sir. ""There is one thing,"". [Peter]_n567 continued,. ""that every boy who serves under [me]_p1549 has to promise, and so must you. [John]_n568 paled. ""[It]_p1550 is this, if [we]_p1551 meet [Hook]_n569 in open fight, [you]_p1552 must leave [him]_p1553 to me. ""[I]_p1554 promise,"".",3,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [John]_n570 said loyally. For the moment [they]_p1555 were feeling less eerie, because [Tink]_n571 was flying with them, and in [her]_p1557 light [they]_p1556 could distinguish each other. Unfortunately [she]_p1558 could not fly so slowly as they, and so [she]_p1559 had to go round and round [them]_p1562 in a circle in which [they]_p1560 moved as in a halo. [Wendy]_n572 quite liked it, until [Peter]_n573 pointed out the drawbacks. ""[She]_p1563 tells me,"". [he]_p1564 said,. ""that the pirates sighted [us]_p1565 before the darkness came, and got [Long Tom]_n574 out. ""The big gun?. ""Yes. And of course [they]_p1566 must see [her]_p1569 light, and if [they]_p1567 guess [we]_p1570 are near [it]_p1571 [they]_p1567 are sure to let fly.",5,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Wendy]_n575 !. ""[John]_n576 !. ""[Michael]_n577 !. ""Tell [her]_p1572 to go away at once, [Peter]_n578 ,"". the three cried simultaneously, but [he]_p1573 refused. ""[She]_p1574 thinks [we]_p1575 have lost the way,"". [he]_p1576 replied stiffly,. ""and [she]_p1577 is rather frightened. [You]_p1578 don't think [I]_p1579 would send [her]_p1580 away all by [herself]_p1581 when [she]_p1582 is frightened! For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave [Peter]_n579 a loving little pinch. ""Then tell her,"".",5,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [Wendy]_n580 begged,. ""to put out [her]_p1583 light. ""[She]_p1584 can't put [it]_p1585 out. That is about the only thing fairies can't do.

""[She]_p1590 can't sleep except when she's sleepy. [It]_p1591 is the only other thing fairies can't do. ""Seems to me,"".",3,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," growled [John]_n583 ,. ""these are the only two things worth doing. Here [he]_p1592 got a pinch, but not a loving one. ""If only one of [us]_p1593 had a pocket,"". [Peter]_n584 said,. ""[we]_p1594 could carry [her]_p1595 in it. "". However, [they]_p1596 had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them. [He]_p1597 had a happy idea. [John]_n585 's hat! [Tink]_n586 agreed to travel by hat if [it]_p1598 was carried in the hand.",4,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [John]_n587 carried it, though [she]_p1599 had hoped to be carried by [Peter]_n588. Presently [Wendy]_n589 took the hat, because [John]_n590 said [it]_p1600 struck against [his]_p1601 knee as [he]_p1602 flew and this, as [we]_p1603 shall see, led to mischief, for [Tinker Bell]_n591 hated to be under an obligation to [Wendy]_n592. In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and [they]_p1604 flew on in silence. [It]_p1605 was the stillest silence [they]_p1606 had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which [Peter]_n593 explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but [he]_p1607 said [it]_p1608 was the redskins sharpening [their]_p1609 knives. Even these noises ceased. To [Michael]_n594 the loneliness was dreadful. ""If only something would make a sound!"". [he]_p1610 cried. As if in answer to [his]_p1611 request, the air was rent by the most tremendous crash [he]_p1612 had ever heard. The pirates had fired [Long Tom]_n595 at them.",9,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," The roar of [it]_p1613 echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to cry savagely,. ""Where are they, where are they, where are they?   Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true. When at last the heavens were steady again, [John]_n596 and [Michael]_n597 found [themselves]_p1614 alone in the darkness. [John]_n598 was treading the air mechanically, and [Michael]_n599 without knowing how to float was floating. ""Are [you]_p1615 shot?"". [John]_n600 whispered tremulously. ""[I]_p1616 haven't tried [myself out] yet,"". [Michael]_n601 whispered back. [We]_p1617 know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while [Wendy]_n602 was blown upwards with no companion but [Tinker Bell]_n603.",8,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p1618 would have been well for [Wendy]_n604 if at that moment [she]_p1619 had dropped the hat. [I]_p1620 don't know whether the idea came suddenly to [Tink]_n605 , or whether [she]_p1621 had planned [it]_p1623 on the way, but [she]_p1622 at once popped out of the hat and began to lure [Wendy]_n606 to [her]_p1624 destruction. [Tink]_n607 was not all bad or, rather, [she]_p1625 was all bad just now, but, on the other hand, sometimes [she]_p1626 was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other, because being so small [they]_p1627 unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. [They]_p1628 are, however, allowed to change, only [it]_p1629 must be a complete change. At present [she]_p1630 was full of jealousy of [Wendy]_n608. What [she]_p1631 said in [her]_p1633 lovely tinkle [Wendy]_n609 could not of course understand, and [I]_p1634 believe some of [it]_p1635 was bad words, but [it]_p1636 sounded kind, and [she]_p1632 flew back and forward, plainly meaning. ""Follow me, and all will be well. What else could poor [Wendy]_n610 do? [She]_p1637 called to [Peter]_n611 and [John]_n612 and [Michael]_n613 , and got only mocking echoes in reply. [She]_p1638 did not yet know that [Tink]_n614 hated [her]_p1639 with the fierce hatred of a very woman.",11,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," And so, bewildered, and now staggering in [her]_p1640 flight, [she]_p1642 followed [Tink]_n615 to [her]_p1641 doom. Chapter 5 THE [ISLAND]_n616 [COME]_n617 [TRUE]_n618 Feeling that Peter was on [his]_p1643 way back, the [Neverland]_n619 had again woke into life. [We]_p1644 ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was always used by [Peter]_n620. In [his]_p1645 absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to [their]_p1646 young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet [they]_p1648 merely bite [their]_p1647 thumbs at each other. But with the coming of [Peter]_n621 , who hates lethargy, [they]_p1649 are under way again: if [you]_p1650 put [your]_p1652 ear to the ground now, [you]_p1651 would hear the whole island seething with life. On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. The lost boys were out looking for [Peter]_n622 , the pirates were out looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. [They]_p1653 were going round and round the island, but [they]_p1654 did not meet because all were going at the same rate. All wanted blood except the boys, who liked [it]_p1655 as a rule, but [to-night]_n623 were out to greet [their]_p1656 captain.",9,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers, according as [they]_p1657 get killed and so on and when [they]_p1658 seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, [Peter]_n624 thins [them]_p1659 out but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two. Let [us]_p1661 pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch [them]_p1662 as [they]_p1663 steal by in single file, each with [his]_p1664 hand on [his]_p1665 dagger. [They]_p1666 are forbidden by [Peter]_n625 to look in the least like him, and [they]_p1667 wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which [they]_p1668 are so round and furry that when [they]_p1668 fall [they]_p1669 roll. [They]_p1671 have therefore become very sure-footed. The first to pass is [Tootles]_n626 , not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band. [He]_p1672 had been in fewer adventures than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when [he]_p1673 had stepped round the corner all would be quiet, [he]_p1674 would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then when [he]_p1674 returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to [his]_p1676 countenance, but instead of souring [his]_p1677 nature had sweetened it, so that [he]_p1678 was quite the humblest of the boys. [Poor]_n627 kind [Tootles]_n628 , there is danger in the air for [you]_p1679 [to-night]_n629. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if accepted, will plunge [you]_p1680 in deepest woe. [Tootles]_n630 , the fairy [Tink]_n631 , who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool [for doing [her]_p1682 mischief], and [she]_p1683 thinks [you]_p1684 are the most easily tricked of the boys.",8,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," [Ware Tinker Bell]_n632. Would that [he]_p1685 could hear us, but [we]_p1687 are not really on the island, and [he]_p1686 passes by, biting [his]_p1688 knuckles. [Next]_n633 comes [Nibs]_n634 , the gay and debonair, followed by [Slightly]_n635 , who cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to [his]_p1689 own tunes. [Slightly]_n636 is the most conceited of the boys. [He]_p1690 thinks [he]_p1691 remembers the days before [he]_p1692 was lost, with [their]_p1693 manners and customs, and this has given [his]_p1694 nose an offensive tilt. [Curly]_n637 is fourth [he]_p1695 is a pickle, [a person who gets in pickles-predicaments] and so often has [he]_p1696 had to deliver up [his]_p1697 person when [Peter]_n638 said sternly,. ""Stand forth the one who did this thing,"". that now at the command [he]_p1698 stands forth automatically whether [he]_p1699 has done [it]_p1700 or not. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because [we]_p1701 should be sure to be describing the wrong one. [Peter]_n639 never quite knew what twins were, and [his]_p1702 band were not allowed to know anything [he]_p1703 did not know, so these two were always vague about themselves, and did [their]_p1704 best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.",8,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on [their]_p1705 track. [We]_p1706 hear [them]_p1707 before [they]_p1708 are seen, and [it]_p1709 is always the same dreadful song:. ""[Avast]_n640 belay, yo ho, heave to, A-pirating [we]_p1710 go, And if we're parted by a shot We're sure to meet below! A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, a little in advance, ever and again with [his]_p1712 head to the ground listening, [his]_p1713 great arms bare, pieces of eight in [his]_p1713 ears as ornaments, is the handsome [Italian Cecco]_n641 , who cut [his]_p1714 name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at [Gao]_n642. That gigantic black behind [him]_p1716 has had many names since [he]_p1717 dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify [their]_p1718 children on the banks of the [Guadjo-mo]_n643. Here is [Bill Jukes]_n644 , every inch of [him]_p1719 tattooed, the same [Bill Jukes]_n645 who got six dozen on the [WALRUS]_n646 from [Flint]_n647 before [he]_p1720 would drop the bag of moidores [Portuguese gold pieces] and [Cookson]_n648 , said to be [Black Murphy]_n649 's brother (but this was never proved), and [Gentleman Starkey]_n650 , once an usher in a public school and still dainty in [his]_p1721 ways of killing and Skylights ([Morgan]_n651 's Skylights) and the [Irish]_n652 bo'sun [Smee]_n653 , an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only [Non-conformist]_n654 in [Hook]_n655 's crew and [Noodler]_n656 , whose hands were fixed on backwards and [Robt]_n657. [Mullins]_n658 and [Alf Mason]_n659 and many another ruffian long known and feared on the [Spanish Main]_n660. In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined [James Hook]_n661 , or as [he]_p1722 wrote himself, [Jas]_n662. [Hook]_n663 , of whom [it]_p1723 is said [he]_p1724 was the only man that the [Sea-Cook]_n664 feared. [He]_p1725 lay at [his]_p1726 ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by [his]_p1727 men, and instead of a right hand [he]_p1728 had the iron hook with which ever and anon [he]_p1729 encouraged [them]_p1730 to increase [their]_p1731 pace.",25,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs [they]_p1732 obeyed him. In person [he]_p1733 was cadaverous [dead looking] and blackavized [dark faced], and [his]_p1734 hair was dressed in long curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly threatening expression to [his]_p1735 handsome countenance. [His]_p1736 eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when [he]_p1737 was plunging [his]_p1738 hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in [them]_p1739 and lit [them]_p1740 up horribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that [he]_p1741 even ripped [you]_p1743 up with an air, and [I]_p1744 have been told that [he]_p1742 was a RACONTEUR [storyteller] of repute. [He]_p1745 was never more sinister than when [he]_p1746 was most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding and the elegance of [his]_p1748 diction, even when [he]_p1747 was swearing, no less than the distinction of [his]_p1749 demeanour, showed [him]_p1751 one of a different cast from [his]_p1749 crew. A man of indomitable courage, [it]_p1752 was said that the only thing [he]_p1753 shied at was the sight of [his]_p1754 own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress [he]_p1755 somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of [Charles II]_n665 , having heard [it]_p1758 said in some earlier period of [his]_p1759 career that [he]_p1756 bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts and in [his]_p1760 mouth [he]_p1756 had a holder of [his]_p1760 own contrivance which enabled [him]_p1762 to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of [him]_p1763 was [his]_p1764 iron claw. Let [us]_p1765 now kill a pirate, to show [Hook]_n666 's method. Skylights will do.",2,,34,
barrie_peter_pan," As [they]_p1766 pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling [his]_p1767 lace collar the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. [He]_p1768 has not even taken the cigars from [his]_p1769 mouth. Such is the terrible man against whom [Peter Pan]_n667 is pitted. Which will win?  On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of [them]_p1770 with [his]_p1771 eyes peeled. [They]_p1772 carry tomahawks and knives, and [their]_p1773 naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around [them]_p1774 are scalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the [Piccaninny]_n668 tribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great [Big Little Panther]_n669 , a brave of so many scalps that in [his]_p1775 present position [they]_p1777 somewhat impede [his]_p1776 progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes [Tiger Lily]_n670 , proudly erect, a princess in [her]_p1778 own right. [She]_p1779 is the most beautiful of [dusky Dianas]_n671 [[Diana]_n672 = goddess of the woods] and the belle of the Piccaninnies, [coquettish]_n673 [flirting], cold and amorous [loving] by turns there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife, but [she]_p1780 staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe how [they]_p1781 pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise.",7,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," The only sound to be heard is [their]_p1782 somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that [they]_p1783 are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time [they]_p1784 will work this off. For the moment, however, [it]_p1785 constitutes [their]_p1786 chief danger. The redskins disappear as [they]_p1787 have come like shadows, and soon [their]_p1788 place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. [Their]_p1789 tongues are hanging out, [they]_p1790 are hungry [to-night]_n674. When [they]_p1791 have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. [We]_p1792 shall see for whom [she]_p1793 is looking presently. The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes [its]_p1794 pace. Then quickly [they]_p1795 will be on top of each other. All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind.",1,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," This shows how real the island was. The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. [They]_p1796 flung [themselves]_p1797 down on the sward [turf], close to [their]_p1798 underground home. ""[I]_p1799 do wish [Peter]_n675 would come back,"". every one of [them]_p1800 said nervously, though in height and still more in breadth [they]_p1801 were all larger than [their]_p1802 captain. ""[I]_p1803 am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,"". [Slightly]_n676 said, in the tone that prevented [his]_p1804 being a general favourite but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him, for [he]_p1805 added hastily,. ""but [I]_p1806 wish [he]_p1807 would come back, and tell [us]_p1809 whether [he]_p1808 has heard anything more about [Cinderella]_n677. [They]_p1810 talked of [Cinderella]_n678 , and [Tootles]_n679 was confident that [his]_p1811 mother must have been very like her. [It]_p1812 was only in [Peter]_n680 's absence that [they]_p1813 could speak of mothers, the subject being forbidden by [him]_p1814 as silly.",6,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""All [I]_p1815 remember about [my]_p1816 mother,"". [Nibs]_n681 told them,. ""is that [she]_p1817 often said to [my]_p1818 father, Oh, how [I]_p1821 wish [I]_p1822 had a cheque-book of [my]_p1819 own!' [I]_p1822 don't know what a cheque-book is, but [I]_p1823 should just love to give [my]_p1819 mother one. While [they]_p1825 talked [they]_p1826 heard a distant sound. [You]_p1827 or I, not being wild things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but [they]_p1828 heard it, and [it]_p1829 was the grim song:. ""Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life, The flag o' skull and bones, A merry hour, a hempen rope, And hey for [Davy Jones]_n682. At once the lost boys, but where are they? [They]_p1831 are no longer there. Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly. [I]_p1832 will tell [you]_p1833 where [they]_p1834 are. With the exception of [Nibs]_n683 , who has darted away to reconnoitre [look around], [they]_p1835 are already in [their]_p1836 home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which [we]_p1837 shall see a good deal presently.",3,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," But how have [they]_p1838 reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and [you]_p1839 may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in [its]_p1840 hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground, for which [Hook]_n684 has been searching in vain these many moons. Will [he]_p1841 find [it]_p1842 tonight? As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of [Starkey]_n685 sighted [Nibs]_n686 disappearing through the wood, and at once [his]_p1843 pistol flashed out. But an iron claw gripped [his]_p1844 shoulder. ""[Captain]_n687 , let go!"". [he]_p1845 cried, writhing. Now for the first time [we]_p1846 hear the voice of [Hook]_n688. [It]_p1847 was a black voice. ""Put back that pistol first,"".",5,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [it]_p1848 said threateningly. ""[It]_p1849 was one of those boys [you]_p1850 hate. [I]_p1851 could have shot [him]_p1852 dead. ""Ay, and the sound would have brought [Tiger Lily]_n689 's redskins upon us. Do [you]_p1853 want to lose [your]_p1854 scalp?. ""[Shall]_n690 [I]_p1855 after him, [Captain]_n691 ,"". asked pathetic [Smee]_n692 ,. ""and tickle [him]_p1856 with [Johnny]_n693 Corkscrew?"". [Smee]_n694 had pleasant names for everything, and [his]_p1857 cutlass was [Johnny]_n695 Corkscrew, because [he]_p1858 wiggled [it]_p1859 in the wound. [[One]_n696 ]_p1860 could mention many lovable traits in [Smee]_n697.",9,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," For instance, after killing, [it]_p1861 was [his]_p1862 spectacles [he]_p1864 wiped instead of [his]_p1863 weapon. ""[Johnny]_n698 's a silent fellow,"". [he]_p1865 reminded [Hook]_n699. ""Not now, [Smee]_n700 ,"". [Hook]_n701 said darkly. ""[He]_p1866 is only one, and [I]_p1867 want to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them. The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment [their]_p1868 [Captain]_n702 and [Smee]_n703 were alone. [Hook]_n704 heaved a heavy sigh, and [I]_p1869 know not why [it]_p1870 was, perhaps [it]_p1871 was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over [him]_p1872 a desire to confide to [his]_p1873 faithful bo'sun the story of [his]_p1874 life. [He]_p1875 spoke long and earnestly, but what [it]_p1876 was all about [Smee]_n705 , who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.",8,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," [Anon]_n706 [later] [he]_p1877 caught the word [Peter]_n707. ""Most of all,"". [Hook]_n708 was saying passionately,. ""[I]_p1878 want [their]_p1879 captain, [Peter Pan]_n709. Twas [he]_p1880 cut off [my]_p1881 arm. "". [He]_p1882 brandished the hook threateningly. ""I've waited long to shake [his]_p1883 hand with this. Oh, I'll tear him!. ""And yet,"".",4,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Smee]_n710 ,. ""[I]_p1884 have often heard [you]_p1885 say that hook was worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses. ""Ay,"". the captain answered,. ""if [I]_p1886 was a mother [I]_p1887 would pray to have [my]_p1888 children born with this instead of that,"". and [he]_p1889 cast a look of pride upon [his]_p1890 iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again [he]_p1891 frowned. ""[Peter]_n711 flung [my]_p1892 arm,"". [he]_p1893 said, wincing,. ""to a crocodile that happened to be passing by.",2,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p1894 have often,"". said [Smee]_n712 ,. ""noticed [your]_p1895 strange dread of crocodiles. ""Not of crocodiles,"". [Hook]_n713 corrected him,. ""but of that one crocodile. "". [He]_p1896 lowered [his]_p1897 voice. ""[It]_p1898 liked [my]_p1899 arm so much, [Smee]_n714 , that [it]_p1900 has followed [me]_p1901 ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking [its]_p1903 lips for the rest of me. ""In a way,"".",3,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Smee]_n715 ,. ""it's sort of a compliment. ""[I]_p1904 want no such compliments,"". [Hook]_n716 barked petulantly. ""[I]_p1905 want [Peter Pan]_n717 , who first gave the brute [its]_p1906 taste for me. [He]_p1907 sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in [his]_p1908 voice. ""[Smee]_n718 ,"". [he]_p1909 said huskily,. ""that crocodile would have had [me]_p1910 before this, but by a lucky chance [it]_p1912 swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it, and so before [it]_p1913 can reach [me]_p1911 [I]_p1915 hear the tick and bolt. "".",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p1916 laughed, but in a hollow way. ""Some day,"". said [Smee]_n719 ,. ""the clock will run down, and then he'll get you. [Hook]_n720 wetted [his]_p1917 dry lips. ""Ay,"". [he]_p1918 said,. ""that's the fear that haunts me. Since sitting down [he]_p1919 had felt curiously warm. ""[Smee]_n721 ,"".",3,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p1920 said,. ""this seat is hot. "". [He]_p1921 jumped up. ""Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I'm burning. [They]_p1922 examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland [they]_p1923 tried to pull [it]_p1924 up, and [it]_p1925 came away at once in [their]_p1927 hands, for [it]_p1925 had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirates looked at each other. ""A chimney!"". [they]_p1928 both exclaimed.",0,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p1929 had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. [It]_p1930 was the custom of the boys to stop [it]_p1931 with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood. Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's voices, for so safe did the boys feel in [their]_p1932 hiding-place that [they]_p1933 were gaily chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. [They]_p1934 looked around [them]_p1935 and noted the holes in the seven trees. ""Did [you]_p1936 hear [them]_p1937 say [Peter Pan]_n722 's from home?"". [Smee]_n723 whispered, fidgeting with [Johnny]_n724 Corkscrew. [Hook]_n725 nodded. [He]_p1938 stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdling smile lit up [his]_p1939 swarthy face.",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [Smee]_n726 had been waiting for it. ""Unrip [your]_p1940 plan, captain,"". [he]_p1941 cried eagerly. ""To return to the ship,"". [Hook]_n727 replied slowly through [his]_p1942 teeth,. ""and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that [they]_p1943 did not need a door apiece. That shows [they]_p1944 have no mother. [We]_p1945 will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids' [Lagoon]_n728.",3,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. [They]_p1946 will find the cake and [they]_p1947 will gobble [it]_p1949 up, because, having no mother, [they]_p1948 don't know how dangerous tis to eat rich damp cake. "". [He]_p1950 burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. ""[Aha]_n729 , [they]_p1951 will die. [Smee]_n730 had listened with growing admiration. ""It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever [I]_p1952 heard of!"". [he]_p1953 cried, and in [their]_p1954 exultation [they]_p1955 danced and sang:. ""[Avast]_n731 , belay, when [I]_p1956 appear, By fear they're overtook [Nought]_n732 's left upon [your]_p1957 bones when [you]_p1958 Have shaken claws with [Hook]_n733. [They]_p1959 began the verse, but [they]_p1960 never finished it, for another sound broke in and stilled them.",5,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on [it]_p1961 and smothered it, but as [it]_p1962 came nearer [it]_p1962 was more distinct. Tick tick tick tick! [Hook]_n734 stood shuddering, one foot in the air. ""The crocodile!"". [he]_p1965 gasped, and bounded away, followed by [his]_p1966 bo'sun. [It]_p1967 was indeed the crocodile. [It]_p1968 had passed the redskins, who were now on the trail of the other pirates. [It]_p1969 oozed on after [Hook]_n735. Once more the boys emerged into the open but the dangers of the night were not yet over, for presently [Nibs]_n736 rushed breathless into [their]_p1970 midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out the baying of [them]_p1971 was horrible. ""Save me, save me!"".",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," cried [Nibs]_n737 , falling on the ground. ""But what can [we]_p1972 do, what can [we]_p1973 do? [It]_p1974 was a high compliment to [Peter]_n738 that at that dire moment [their]_p1975 thoughts turned to him. ""What would [Peter]_n739 do?"". [they]_p1976 cried simultaneously. Almost in the same breath [they]_p1977 cried,. ""[Peter]_n740 would look at [them]_p1978 through [his]_p1979 legs. And then,. ""Let [us]_p1980 do what [Peter]_n741 would do. [It]_p1981 is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy [they]_p1982 bent and looked through [their]_p1983 legs. The next moment is the long one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon [them]_p1984 in the terrible attitude, the wolves dropped [their]_p1985 tails and fled.",5,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," Now [Nibs]_n742 rose from the ground, and the others thought that [his]_p1986 staring eyes still saw the wolves. But [it]_p1987 was not wolves [he]_p1988 saw. ""[I]_p1989 have seen a wonderfuller thing,"". [he]_p1990 cried, as [they]_p1991 gathered round [him]_p1992 eagerly. ""A great white bird. [It]_p1993 is flying this way. ""What kind of a bird, do [you]_p1994 think?. ""[I]_p1995 don't know,"". [Nibs]_n743 said, awestruck,.

""See, [it]_p2000 comes!"". cried [Curly]_n749 , pointing to [Wendy]_n750 in the heavens. [Wendy]_n751 was now almost overhead, and [they]_p2001 could hear [her]_p2002 plaintive cry. But more distinct came the shrill voice of [Tinker Bell]_n752. The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting at [her]_p2003 victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time [she]_p2004 touched.",7,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Hullo]_n753 , [Tink]_n754 ,"". cried the wondering boys. [Tink]_n755 's reply rang out:. ""[Peter]_n756 wants [you]_p2005 to shoot the [Wendy]_n757. [It]_p2006 was not in [their]_p2007 nature to question when [Peter]_n758 ordered. ""Let [us]_p2008 do what [Peter]_n759 wishes!"". cried the simple boys. ""[Quick]_n760 , bows and arrows! All but [Tootles]_n761 popped down [their]_p2009 trees. [He]_p2010 had a bow and arrow with him, and [Tink]_n762 noted it, and rubbed [her]_p2011 little hands. ""[Quick]_n763 , [Tootles]_n764 , quick,"".",12,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p2012 screamed. ""[Peter]_n765 will be so pleased. [Tootles]_n766 excitedly fitted the arrow to [his]_p2013 bow. ""Out of the way, [Tink]_n767 , [he]_p2014 shouted, and then [he]_p2015 fired, and [Wendy]_n768 fluttered to the ground with an arrow in [her]_p2016 breast.

[he]_p2019 cried proudly,. ""[I]_p2020 have shot the [Wendy]_n771. [Peter]_n772 will be so pleased with me. [Overhead Tinker Bell]_n773 shouted.",9,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Silly ass!"". and darted into hiding. The others did not hear her. [They]_p2021 had crowded round [Wendy]_n774 , and as [they]_p2022 looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If [Wendy]_n775 's heart had been beating [they]_p2023 would all have heard it. [Slightly]_n776 was the first to speak. ""This is no bird,"". [he]_p2024 said in a scared voice. ""[I]_p2025 think this must be a [lady]_n777. ""A [lady]_n778 ?"".",5,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Tootles]_n779 , and fell a-trembling. ""And [we]_p2026 have killed her,"". [Nibs]_n780 said hoarsely. [They]_p2027 all whipped off [their]_p2028 caps. ""Now [I]_p2029 see,"". [Curly]_n781 said:. ""[Peter]_n782 was bringing [her]_p2030 to us. "". [He]_p2031 threw [himself]_p2032 sorrowfully on the ground. ""A [lady]_n783 to take care of [us]_p2033 at last,"".",5,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," said one of the twins,. ""and [you]_p2034 have killed her!   [They]_p2035 were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when [he]_p2036 took a step nearer [them]_p2037 [they]_p2038 turned from him. [Tootles]_n784 ' face was very white, but there was a dignity about [him]_p2039 now that had never been there before. ""[I]_p2040 did it,"". [he]_p2041 said, reflecting. ""When ladies used to come to [me]_p2042 in dreams, [I]_p2043 said, [Pretty]_n785 mother, pretty mother. ' But when at last [she]_p2044 really came, [I]_p2045 shot her. [He]_p2046 moved slowly away. ""Don't go,"". [they]_p2047 called in pity.",2,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p2048 must,"". [he]_p2049 answered, shaking. ""[I]_p2050 am so afraid of [Peter]_n786.

""[Peter]_n788 !"". [they]_p2056 cried, for [it]_p2057 was always thus that [he]_p2058 signalled [his]_p2059 return. ""[Hide]_n789 her,"". [they]_p2060 whispered, and gathered hastily around [Wendy]_n790. But [Tootles]_n791 stood [aloof]_n792.",7,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," Again came that ringing crow, and [Peter]_n793 dropped in front of them. ""Greetings, boys,"". [he]_p2061 cried, and mechanically [they]_p2062 saluted, and then again was silence. [He]_p2063 frowned. ""[I]_p2064 am back,"". [he]_p2065 said hotly,. ""why do [you]_p2066 not cheer?   [They]_p2067 opened [their]_p2068 mouths, but the cheers would not come. [He]_p2069 overlooked [it]_p2070 in [his]_p2071 haste to tell the glorious tidings. ""[Great]_n794 news, boys,"". [he]_p2072 cried,.",2,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p2073 have brought at last a mother for [you]_p2074 all. Still no sound, except a little thud from [Tootles]_n795 as [he]_p2075 dropped on [his]_p2076 knees. ""Have [you]_p2077 not seen her?"". asked [Peter]_n796 , becoming troubled. ""[She]_p2078 flew this way. ""Ah me!"". one voice said, and another said,. ""Oh, mournful day. [Tootles]_n797 rose. ""[Peter]_n798 ,"".",4,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p2079 said quietly,. ""[I]_p2080 will show [her]_p2081 to you,"". and when the others would still have hidden [her]_p2082 [he]_p2083 said,. ""Back, twins, let [Peter]_n799 see. So [they]_p2084 all stood back, and let [him]_p2085 see, and after [he]_p2086 had looked for a little time [he]_p2087 did not know what to do next. ""[She]_p2088 is dead,"". [he]_p2089 said uncomfortably. ""Perhaps [she]_p2090 is frightened at being dead. [He]_p2091 thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till [he]_p2092 was out of sight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. [They]_p2093 would all have been glad to follow if [he]_p2094 had done this.",1,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," But there was the arrow. [He]_p2095 took [it]_p2096 from [her]_p2097 heart and faced [his]_p2098 band. ""Whose arrow?"". [he]_p2099 demanded sternly. ""[Mine]_n800 , [Peter]_n801 ,"". said [Tootles]_n802 on [his]_p2100 knees. ""Oh, dastard hand,"". [Peter]_n803 said, and [he]_p2101 raised the arrow to use [it]_p2102 as a dagger. [Tootles]_n804 did not flinch. [He]_p2103 bared [his]_p2104 breast.",5,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Strike]_n805 , [Peter]_n806 ,"". [he]_p2105 said firmly,. ""strike true. Twice did [Peter]_n807 raise the arrow, and twice did [his]_p2106 hand fall.

barrie_peter_pan," ""the [Wendy]_n810 [lady]_n811 , see, [her]_p2113 arm! Wonderful to relate [tell], [Wendy]_n812 had raised [her]_p2114 arm.

barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p2134 was begging [Wendy]_n822 to get better quickly, so that [he]_p2135 could show [her]_p2136 the mermaids. Of course [she]_p2137 could not answer yet, being still in a frightful faint but from overhead came a wailing note. ""[Listen]_n823 to [Tink]_n824 ,"". said [Curly]_n825 ,. ""[she]_p2138 is crying because the [Wendy]_n826 lives. Then [they]_p2139 had to tell [Peter]_n827 of [Tink]_n828 's crime, and almost never had [they]_p2140 seen [him]_p2141 look so stern. ""[Listen]_n829 , [Tinker Bell]_n830 ,"". [he]_p2142 cried,. ""[I]_p2143 am [your]_p2144 friend no more. Begone from [me]_p2145 for ever.",9,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p2146 flew on to [his]_p2147 shoulder and pleaded, but [he]_p2148 brushed [her]_p2149 off. Not until [Wendy]_n831 again raised [her]_p2150 arm did [he]_p2151 relent sufficiently to say,. ""Well, not for ever, but for a whole week. Do [you]_p2152 think [Tinker Bell]_n832 was grateful to [Wendy]_n833 for raising [her]_p2153 arm? Oh dear no, never wanted to pinch [her]_p2154 so much. Fairies indeed are strange, and [Peter]_n834 , who understood [them]_p2155 best, often cuffed [slapped] them. But what to do with [Wendy]_n835 in [her]_p2157 present delicate state of health?. ""Let [us]_p2158 carry [her]_p2159 down into the house,"". [Curly]_n836 suggested. ""Ay,"". said [Slightly]_n837 ,.",7,,13,

[They]_p2174 skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and while [they]_p2175 were at it, who should appear but [John]_n844 and [Michael]_n845. As [they]_p2176 dragged along the ground [they]_p2177 fell [asleep]_n846 standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step and slept again. ""[John]_n847 , [John]_n848 ,"". [Michael]_n849 would cry,.

[He]_p2185 was very busy at the moment measuring [Wendy]_n858 with [his]_p2186 feet to see how large a house [she]_p2187 would need. Of course [he]_p2188 meant to leave room for chairs and a table. [John]_n859 and [Michael]_n860 watched him. ""Is [Wendy]_n861 [asleep]_n862 ?"". [they]_p2189 asked.",10,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes. ""[John]_n863 ,"". [Michael]_n864 proposed,.

""fetch a doctor. ""Ay, ay,"". said [Slightly]_n879 at once, and disappeared, scratching [his]_p2205 head. But [he]_p2206 knew [Peter]_n880 must be obeyed, and [he]_p2207 returned in a moment, wearing [John]_n881 's hat and looking solemn.",6,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Please, sir,"". said [Peter]_n882 , going to him,. ""are [you]_p2208 a doctor?   The difference between [him]_p2209 and the other boys at such a time was that [they]_p2211 knew [it]_p2212 was make-believe, while to [him]_p2210 make-believe and true were exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when [they]_p2213 had to make-believe that [they]_p2214 had had [their]_p2215 dinners. If [they]_p2216 broke down in [their]_p2217 make-believe [he]_p2218 rapped [them]_p2219 on the knuckles. ""Yes, [my]_p2220 little man,"". [Slightly]_n883 anxiously replied, who had chapped knuckles. ""Please, sir,"". [Peter]_n884 explained,. ""a [lady]_n885 lies very ill.",4,,13,

[It]_p2228 was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn. ""How is she?"". inquired [Peter]_n890.",5,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Tut]_n891 , tut, tut,"". said [Slightly]_n892 ,. ""this has cured her. ""[I]_p2229 am glad!"". [Peter]_n893 cried. ""[I]_p2230 will call again in the evening,"".

In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at [Wendy]_n896 's feet.",6,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""If only [we]_p2236 knew,"". said one,. ""the kind of house [she]_p2237 likes best. ""[Peter]_n897 ,"". shouted another,. ""[she]_p2238 is moving in [her]_p2239 sleep. ""[Her]_p2240 mouth opens,"". cried a third, looking respectfully into it. ""Oh, lovely!. ""Perhaps [she]_p2241 is going to sing in [her]_p2242 sleep,"".",1,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Peter]_n898. ""[Wendy]_n899 , sing the kind of house [you]_p2243 would like to have. Immediately, without opening [her]_p2244 eyes, [Wendy]_n900 began to sing:. ""[I]_p2245 wish [I]_p2246 had a pretty house, The littlest ever seen, With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green. [They]_p2247 gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches [they]_p2248 had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted with moss. As [they]_p2249 rattled up the little house [they]_p2250 broke into song themselves:. ""We've built the little walls and roof And made a lovely door, So tell us, mother [Wendy]_n901 , What are [you]_p2251 wanting more? To this [she]_p2252 answered greedily:. ""Oh, really next [I]_p2253 think I'll have [Gay]_n902 windows all about, With roses peeping in, [you]_p2255 know, And babies peeping out. With a blow of [their]_p2256 fists [they]_p2257 made windows, and large yellow leaves were the blinds. But roses, ?.",5,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Roses,"". cried [Peter]_n903 sternly. Quickly [they]_p2258 made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls. Babies? To prevent [Peter]_n904 ordering babies [they]_p2259 hurried into song again:. ""We've made the roses peeping out, The babes are at the door, [We]_p2260 cannot make ourselves, [you]_p2262 know, cos we've been made before. [Peter]_n905 , seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that [it]_p2263 was [his]_p2264 own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt [Wendy]_n906 was very cosy within, though, of course, [they]_p2265 could no longer see her. [Peter]_n907 strode up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped [his]_p2266 eagle eyes. Just when [it]_p2267 seemed absolutely finished:.",5,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""There's no knocker on the door,"". [he]_p2268 said. [They]_p2269 were very ashamed, but [Tootles]_n908 gave the sole of [his]_p2270 shoe, and [it]_p2271 made an excellent knocker. Absolutely finished now, [they]_p2272 thought. Not of bit of it. ""There's no chimney,"". [Peter]_n909 said. ""[we]_p2273 must have a chimney. ""[It]_p2274 certainly does need a chimney,"". said [John]_n910 importantly.",3,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," This gave [Peter]_n911 an idea. [He]_p2275 snatched the hat off [John]_n912 's head, knocked out the bottom [top], and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began to come out of the hat. Now really and truly [it]_p2276 was finished. Nothing remained to do but to knock. ""All look [your]_p2277 best,"". [Peter]_n913 warned [them]_p2278. ""first impressions are awfully important.

[He]_p2283 knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a sound to be heard except from [Tinker Bell]_n914 , who was watching from a branch and openly sneering.",4,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a [lady]_n915 , what would [she]_p2284 be like? The door opened and a [lady]_n916 came out. [It]_p2285 was [Wendy]_n917. [They]_p2286 all whipped off [their]_p2287 hats. [She]_p2288 looked properly surprised, and this was just how [they]_p2289 had hoped [she]_p2290 would look. ""Where am I?"". [she]_p2291 said. Of course [Slightly]_n918 was the first to get [his]_p2292 word in. ""[Wendy]_n919 [lady]_n920 ,"". [he]_p2293 said rapidly,. ""for [you]_p2294 [we]_p2295 built this house.",6,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Oh, say you're pleased,"". cried [Nibs]_n921. ""Lovely, darling house,"". [Wendy]_n922 said, and [they]_p2296 were the very words [they]_p2297 had hoped [she]_p2298 would say. ""And [we]_p2299 are [your]_p2300 children,"". cried the twins. Then all went on [their]_p2301 knees, and holding out [their]_p2302 arms cried,. ""O [Wendy]_n923 [lady]_n924 , be [our]_p2303 mother. ""Ought I?"". [Wendy]_n925 said, all shining.",5,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Of course it's frightfully fascinating, but [you]_p2304 see [I]_p2305 am only a little girl. [I]_p2306 have no real experience. ""That doesn't matter,"". said [Peter]_n926 , as if [he]_p2307 were the only person present who knew all about it, though [he]_p2308 was really the one who knew least. ""What [we]_p2309 need is just a nice motherly person. ""Oh dear!"". [Wendy]_n927 said,. ""[you]_p2310 see, [I]_p2311 feel that is exactly what [I]_p2312 am. ""[It]_p2313 is, [it]_p2314 is,"".

barrie_peter_pan," ""[we]_p2316 saw [it]_p2317 at once. ""Very well,"". [she]_p2318 said,. ""[I]_p2319 will do [my]_p2320 best. Come inside at once, [you]_p2321 naughty children [I]_p2322 am sure [your]_p2323 feet are damp. And before [I]_p2324 put [you]_p2326 to bed [I]_p2325 have just time to finish the story of [Cinderella]_n928. In [they]_p2327 went [I]_p2328 don't know how there was room for them, but [you]_p2329 can squeeze very tight in the [Neverland]_n929. And that was the first of the many joyous evenings [they]_p2330 had with [Wendy]_n930. By and by [she]_p2331 tucked [them]_p2333 up in the great bed in the home under the trees, but [she]_p2332 [herself]_p2334 slept that night in the little house, and [Peter]_n931 kept watch outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing through [its]_p2335 blinds, and the chimney smoking beautifully, and [Peter]_n932 standing on guard.",5,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," After a time [he]_p2336 fell [asleep]_n933 , and some unsteady fairies had to climb over [him]_p2337 on [their]_p2338 way home from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night [they]_p2339 would have mischiefed, but [they]_p2340 just tweaked [Peter]_n934 's nose and passed on. Chapter 7 THE [HOME UNDER]_n935 THE [GROUND]_n936 [One]_n937 of the first things [Peter]_n938 did next day was to measure [Wendy]_n939 and [John]_n940 and [Michael]_n941 for hollow trees. [Hook]_n942 , [you]_p2341 remember, had sneered at the boys for thinking [they]_p2343 needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless [your]_p2344 tree fitted [you]_p2342 [it]_p2345 was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once [you]_p2346 fitted, [you]_p2347 drew in [let out] [your]_p2350 breath at the top, and down [you]_p2347 went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend [you]_p2348 drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when [you]_p2351 have mastered the action [you]_p2352 are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more graceful. But [you]_p2353 simply must fit, and [Peter]_n943 measures [you]_p2354 for [your]_p2357 tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you, while [you]_p2354 have to be made to fit the tree. Usually [it]_p2358 is done quite easily, as by [your]_p2359 wearing too many garments or too few, but if [you]_p2360 are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, [Peter]_n944 does some things to you, and after that [you]_p2361 fit. Once [you]_p2363 fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this, as [Wendy]_n945 was to discover to [her]_p2364 delight, keeps a whole family in perfect condition. [Wendy]_n946 and [Michael]_n947 fitted [their]_p2365 trees at the first try, but [John]_n948 had to be altered a little.",16,,28,
barrie_peter_pan," After a few days' practice [they]_p2366 could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well. And how ardently [they]_p2367 grew to love [their]_p2368 home under the ground especially [Wendy]_n949. [It]_p2369 consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, with a floor in which [you]_p2370 could dig [for worms] if [you]_p2371 wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A [Never]_n950 tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning [they]_p2372 sawed the trunk through, level with the floor. By [tea-time]_n951 [it]_p2373 was always about two feet high, and then [they]_p2375 put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table as soon as [they]_p2376 cleared away, [they]_p2376 sawed off the trunk again, and thus there was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where [you]_p2378 cared to light it, and across this [Wendy]_n952 stretched strings, made of fibre, from which [she]_p2379 suspended [her]_p2380 washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when [it]_p2381 filled nearly half the room and all the boys slept in it, except [Michael]_n953 , lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at once. [Michael]_n954 should have used [it]_p2383 also, but [Wendy]_n955 would have [desired] a baby, and [he]_p2385 was the littlest, and [you]_p2387 know what women are, and the short and long of [it]_p2384 is that [he]_p2386 was hung up in a basket. [It]_p2388 was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances.",7,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," But there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of [Tinker Bell]_n956. [It]_p2389 could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which [Tink]_n957 , who was most fastidious [particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room] and bed-chamber combined. The couch, as [she]_p2390 always called it, was a genuine [Queen Mab]_n958 , with club legs and [she]_p2391 varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in season. [Her]_p2392 mirror was a [Puss-in-Boots]_n959 , of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers the washstand was [Pie-crust]_n960 and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the [Sixth]_n961 , and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of [Margery]_n962 and [Robin]_n963. There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course [she]_p2393 lit the residence herself. [Tink]_n964 was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and [her]_p2394 chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up. [I]_p2395 suppose [it]_p2396 was all especially entrancing to [Wendy]_n965 , because those rampagious boys of [hers]_p2397 gave [her]_p2398 so much to do. Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, [she]_p2399 was never above ground. The cooking, [I]_p2400 can tell you, kept [her]_p2401 nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, [she]_p2404 had to keep watching that [it]_p2402 came aboil just the same.",10,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [You]_p2405 never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, [it]_p2406 all depended upon [Peter]_n966 's whim: [he]_p2409 could eat, really eat, if [it]_p2407 was part of a game, but [he]_p2410 could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel stodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than anything else the next best thing being to talk about it. [Make-believe]_n967 was so real to [him]_p2411 that during a meal of [it]_p2413 [you]_p2414 could see [him]_p2412 getting rounder. Of course [it]_p2415 was trying, but [you]_p2416 simply had to follow [his]_p2420 lead, and if [you]_p2417 could prove to [him]_p2421 that [you]_p2417 were getting loose for [your]_p2422 tree [he]_p2423 let [you]_p2418 stodge. [Wendy]_n968 's favourite time for sewing and darning was after [they]_p2424 had all gone to bed. Then, as [she]_p2425 expressed it, [she]_p2426 had a breathing time for [herself]_p2430 and [she]_p2426 occupied [it]_p2428 in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for [they]_p2431 were all most frightfully hard on [their]_p2432 knees. When [she]_p2433 sat down to a basketful of [their]_p2435 stockings, every heel with a hole in it, [she]_p2434 would fling up [her]_p2436 arms and exclaim,. ""Oh dear, [I]_p2437 am sure [I]_p2438 sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!   [Her]_p2439 face beamed when [she]_p2440 exclaimed this. [You]_p2441 remember about [her]_p2442 pet wolf. Well, [it]_p2443 very soon discovered that [she]_p2445 had come to the island and [it]_p2444 found [her]_p2446 out, and [they]_p2447 just ran into each other's arms. After that [it]_p2448 followed [her]_p2449 about everywhere.",3,,43,
barrie_peter_pan," As time wore on did [she]_p2450 think much about the beloved parents [she]_p2451 had left behind her? This is a difficult question, because [it]_p2452 is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the [Neverland]_n969 , where [it]_p2453 is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of [them]_p2454 than on the mainland. But [I]_p2455 am afraid that [Wendy]_n970 did not really worry about [her]_p2456 father and mother [she]_p2459 was absolutely confident that [they]_p2460 would always keep the window open for [her]_p2457 to fly back by, and this gave [her]_p2457 complete ease of mind. What did disturb [her]_p2461 at times was that [John]_n971 remembered [his]_p2462 parents vaguely only, as people [he]_p2464 had once known, while [Michael]_n972 was quite willing to believe that [she]_p2465 was really [his]_p2463 mother. These things scared [her]_p2466 a little, and nobly anxious to do [her]_p2467 duty, [she]_p2468 tried to fix the old life in [their]_p2470 minds by setting [them]_p2471 examination papers on it, as like as possible to the ones [she]_p2469 used to do at school. The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and [they]_p2472 made slates for themselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the questions [she]_p2473 had written on another slate and passed round. [They]_p2474 were the most ordinary questions,. ""What was the colour of [Mother]_n973 's eyes? Which was taller, [Father]_n974 or [Mother]_n975 ?[ Was M]_n976 other blonde or [brunette]_n977 ? [Answer]_n978 all three questions if possible. ""(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How [I]_p2475 spent [my]_p2476 last Holidays, or The Characters of [Father]_n979 and [Mother]_n980 compared. Only one of these to be attempted. "".",12,,27,
barrie_peter_pan," Or. ""(1) [Describe Mother]_n981 's laugh (2) [Describe Father]_n982 's laugh (3) [Describe Mother]_n983 's [Party Dress]_n984 (4) Describe the [Kennel]_n985 and [its]_p2477 Inmate. [They]_p2478 were just everyday questions like these, and when [you]_p2479 could not answer [them]_p2481 [you]_p2480 were told to make a cross and [it]_p2482 was really dreadful what a number of crosses even [John]_n986 made. Of course the only boy who replied to every question was [Slightly]_n987 , and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, but [his]_p2483 answers were perfectly ridiculous, and [he]_p2484 really came out last: a melancholy thing. [Peter]_n988 did not compete. For one thing [he]_p2485 despised all mothers except [Wendy]_n989 , and for another [he]_p2486 was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor spell not the smallest word. [He]_p2487 was above all that sort of thing. By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was the colour of [Mother]_n990 's eyes, and so on. [Wendy]_n991 , [you]_p2488 see, had been forgetting, too.",11,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," Adventures, of course, as [we]_p2489 shall see, were of daily occurrence but about this time [Peter]_n992 invented, with [Wendy]_n993 's help, a new game that fascinated [him]_p2490 enormously, until [he]_p2491 suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as [you]_p2492 have been told, was what always happened with [his]_p2493 games. [It]_p2494 consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing [John]_n994 and [Michael]_n995 had been doing all [their]_p2495 lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To see [Peter]_n996 doing nothing on a stool was a great sight [he]_p2496 could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to [him]_p2497 such a comic thing to do. [He]_p2498 boasted that [he]_p2499 had gone walking for the good of [his]_p2500 health. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to [him]_p2501 and [John]_n997 and [Michael]_n998 had to pretend to be delighted also otherwise [he]_p2502 would have treated [them]_p2503 severely. [He]_p2504 often went out alone, and when [he]_p2505 came back [you]_p2507 were never absolutely certain whether [he]_p2506 had had an adventure or not. [He]_p2508 might have forgotten [it]_p2509 so completely that [he]_p2512 said nothing about [it]_p2510 and then when [you]_p2514 went out [you]_p2515 found the body and, on the other hand, [he]_p2513 might say a great deal about it, and yet [you]_p2515 could not find the body. Sometimes [he]_p2517 came home with [his]_p2519 head bandaged, and then [Wendy]_n999 cooed over [him]_p2520 and bathed [it]_p2521 in lukewarm water, while [he]_p2518 told a dazzling tale. But [she]_p2522 was never quite sure, [you]_p2523 know. There were, however, many adventures which [she]_p2524 knew to be true because [she]_p2525 was in [them]_p2526 herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in [them]_p2527 and said [they]_p2528 were wholly true.",8,,39,
barrie_peter_pan," To describe [them]_p2529 all would require a book as large as an [English-Latin]_n1000 , [Latin-English Dictionary]_n1001 , and the most [we]_p2530 can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The difficulty is which [one]_p2531 to choose. Should [we]_p2532 take the brush with the redskins at [Slightly Gulch]_n1002 ? [It]_p2533 was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of [Peter]_n1003 's peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight [he]_p2534 would suddenly change sides. At the [Gulch]_n1004 , when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, [he]_p2535 called out,. ""I'm redskin [to-day]_n1005 what are you, [Tootles]_n1006 ?"". And [Tootles]_n1007 answered,. ""Redskin what are you, [Nibs]_n1008 ?"". and [Nibs]_n1009 said,. ""Redskin what are [you]_p2536 [Twin]_n1010 ?"". and so on and [they]_p2537 were all redskins and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by [Peter]_n1011 's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at [it]_p2539 [they]_p2538 all went again, more fiercely than ever.",12,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was, but [we]_p2540 have not decided yet that this is the adventure [we]_p2541 are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of [them]_p2542 stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or [we]_p2543 might tell how [Peter]_n1012 saved [Tiger Lily]_n1013 's life in the Mermaids' [Lagoon]_n1014 , and so made [her]_p2544 [his]_p2545 ally. Or [we]_p2546 could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat [it]_p2547 and perish and how [they]_p2552 placed [it]_p2548 in one cunning spot after another but always [Wendy]_n1015 snatched [it]_p2548 from the hands of [her]_p2553 children, so that in time [it]_p2549 lost [its]_p2554 succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and [Hook]_n1016 fell over [it]_p2549 in the dark. Or suppose [we]_p2555 tell of the birds that were [Peter]_n1017 's friends, particularly of the [Never]_n1018 bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on [her]_p2556 eggs, and [Peter]_n1019 gave orders that [she]_p2557 was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be but if [we]_p2558 tell [it]_p2560 [we]_p2559 must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was [Tinker Bell]_n1020 's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping [Wendy]_n1021 conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and [Wendy woke]_n1022 , thinking [it]_p2561 was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, [we]_p2562 might choose [Peter]_n1023 's defiance of the lions, when [he]_p2563 drew a circle round [him]_p2565 on the ground with an arrow and dared [them]_p2566 to cross [it]_p2568 and though [he]_p2564 waited for hours, with the other boys and [Wendy]_n1024 looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of [them]_p2567 dared to accept [his]_p2569 challenge. Which of these adventures shall [we]_p2570 choose? The best way will be to toss for it.",13,,31,
barrie_peter_pan," [I]_p2571 have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or [Tink]_n1025 's leaf had won. Of course [I]_p2572 could do [it]_p2573 again, and make [it]_p2574 best out of three however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon. Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON  If [you]_p2575 shut [your]_p2578 eyes and are a lucky one, [you]_p2576 may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness then if [you]_p2576 squeeze [your]_p2579 eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze [they]_p2580 must go on fire. But just before [they]_p2581 go on fire [you]_p2582 see the lagoon. This is the nearest [you]_p2583 ever get to [it]_p2585 on the mainland, just one heavenly moment if there could be two moments [you]_p2584 might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing. The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. [You]_p2586 must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, [it]_p2587 was among [Wendy]_n1026 's lasting regrets that all the time [she]_p2588 was on the island [she]_p2589 never had a civil word from one of them. When [she]_p2590 stole softly to the edge of the lagoon [she]_p2591 might see [them]_p2593 by the score, especially on Marooners' [Rock]_n1027 , where [they]_p2595 loved to bask, combing out [their]_p2597 hair in a lazy way that quite irritated [her]_p2599 or [she]_p2591 might even swim, on tiptoe as [it]_p2602 were, to within a yard of them, but then [they]_p2596 saw [her]_p2600 and dived, probably splashing [her]_p2600 with [their]_p2598 tails, not by accident, but intentionally. [They]_p2603 treated all the boys in the same way, except of course [Peter]_n1028 , who chatted with [them]_p2604 on Marooners' [Rock]_n1029 by the hour, and sat on [their]_p2605 tails when [they]_p2606 got cheeky.",5,,35,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p2607 gave [Wendy]_n1030 one of [their]_p2608 combs. The most haunting time at which to see [them]_p2609 is at the turn of the moon, when [they]_p2610 utter strange wailing cries but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which [we]_p2611 have now to tell, [Wendy]_n1031 had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course [Peter]_n1032 would have accompanied her, than because [she]_p2612 had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven. [She]_p2613 was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with [their]_p2614 bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water [they]_p2615 treat as balls, hitting [them]_p2617 gaily from one to another with [their]_p2619 tails, and trying to keep [them]_p2618 in the rainbow till [they]_p2616 burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use [their]_p2620 hands. Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and [it]_p2621 is quite a pretty sight. But the moment the children tried to join in [they]_p2622 had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless [we]_p2623 have proof that [they]_p2624 secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from [them]_p2625 for [John]_n1033 introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that [John]_n1034 has left on the [Neverland]_n1035. [It]_p2626 must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after [their]_p2627 mid-day meal.",6,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," [Wendy]_n1036 insisted on [their]_p2628 doing this, and [it]_p2629 had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe. So [they]_p2630 lay there in the sun, and [their]_p2631 bodies glistened in it, while [she]_p2632 sat beside [them]_p2633 and looked important. [It]_p2634 was one such day, and [they]_p2635 were all on Marooners' [Rock]_n1037. The rock was not much larger than [their]_p2636 great bed, but of course [they]_p2638 all knew how not to take up much room, and [they]_p2639 were dozing, or at least lying with [their]_p2637 eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when [they]_p2639 thought [Wendy]_n1038 was not looking. [She]_p2641 was very busy, stitching. While [she]_p2642 stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning [it]_p2643 cold. [Wendy]_n1039 could no longer see to thread [her]_p2645 needle, and when [she]_p2646 looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly. [It]_p2647 was not, [she]_p2648 knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come. No, worse than that.",4,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p2649 had not come, but [it]_p2650 had sent that shiver through the sea to say that [it]_p2651 was coming. What was it? There crowded upon [her]_p2654 all the stories [she]_p2655 had been told of Marooners' [Rock]_n1040 , so called because evil captains put sailors on [it]_p2652 and leave [them]_p2656 there to drown. [They]_p2657 drown when the tide rises, for then [it]_p2658 is submerged. Of course [she]_p2659 should have roused the children at once not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because [it]_p2662 was no longer good for [them]_p2660 to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But [she]_p2663 was a young mother and [she]_p2664 did not know this [she]_p2664 thought [you]_p2666 simply must stick to [your]_p2667 rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and [she]_p2668 longed to hear male voices, [she]_p2669 would not waken them. Even when [she]_p2670 heard the sound of muffled oars, though [her]_p2672 heart was in [her]_p2673 mouth, [she]_p2671 did not waken them. [She]_p2674 stood over [them]_p2675 to let [them]_p2676 have [their]_p2677 sleep out. Was [it]_p2678 not brave of [Wendy]_n1041 ? [It]_p2679 was well for those boys then that there was one among [them]_p2680 who could sniff danger even in [his]_p2681 sleep. [Peter]_n1042 sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog, and with one warning cry [he]_p2682 roused the others.",3,,32,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p2683 stood motionless, one hand to [his]_p2684 ear. ""Pirates!"". [he]_p2685 cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was playing about [his]_p2686 face, and [Wendy]_n1043 saw [it]_p2687 and shuddered. While that smile was on [his]_p2688 face no one dared address [him]_p2689 all [they]_p2690 could do was to stand ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive. ""Dive!   There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted. Marooners' [Rock]_n1044 stood alone in the forbidding waters as if [it]_p2691 were [itself]_p2692 marooned. The boat drew nearer.",2,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p2693 was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, [Smee]_n1045 and [Starkey]_n1046 , and the third a captive, no other than [Tiger Lily]_n1047. [Her]_p2694 hands and ankles were tied, and [she]_p2695 knew what was to be [her]_p2696 fate. [She]_p2697 was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of [her]_p2698 race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is [it]_p2700 not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy [hunting-ground]_n1048 ? Yet [her]_p2699 face was impassive [she]_p2702 was the daughter of a chief, [she]_p2703 must die as a chief's daughter, [it]_p2701 is enough. [They]_p2704 had caught [her]_p2705 boarding the pirate ship with a knife in [her]_p2706 mouth. No watch was kept on the ship, [it]_p2707 being [Hook]_n1049 's boast that the wind of [his]_p2708 name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now [her]_p2709 fate would help to guard [it]_p2710 also. [One]_n1050 more wail would go the round in that wind by night. In the gloom that [they]_p2711 brought with [them]_p2713 the two pirates did not see the rock till [they]_p2712 crashed into it. ""[Luff]_n1051 , [you]_p2714 lubber,"". cried an [Irish]_n1052 voice that was [Smee]_n1053 's.",9,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," ""here's the rock. Now, then, what [we]_p2715 have to do is to hoist the redskin on to [it]_p2716 and leave [her]_p2717 here to drown. [It]_p2718 was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock [she]_p2719 was too proud to offer a vain resistance. Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down, [Peter]_n1054 's and [Wendy]_n1055 's. [Wendy]_n1056 was crying, for [it]_p2720 was the first tragedy [she]_p2721 had seen. [Peter]_n1057 had seen many tragedies, but [he]_p2722 had forgotten [them]_p2723 all. [He]_p2724 was less sorry than [Wendy]_n1058 for [Tiger Lily]_n1059 : [it]_p2725 was two against one that angered him, and [he]_p2726 meant to save her. An easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but [he]_p2727 was never one to choose the easy way. There was almost nothing [he]_p2728 could not do, and [he]_p2729 now imitated the voice of [Hook]_n1060. ""Ahoy there, [you]_p2730 lubbers!"".",7,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p2731 called. [It]_p2732 was a marvellous imitation. ""The captain!"". said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise. ""[He]_p2733 must be swimming out to us,"". [Starkey]_n1061 said, when [they]_p2734 had looked for [him]_p2735 in vain. ""[We]_p2736 are putting the redskin on the rock,"". [Smee]_n1062 called out. ""Set [her]_p2737 free,"". came the astonishing answer.",2,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Free!. ""Yes, cut [her]_p2738 bonds and let [her]_p2739 go. ""But, captain,. ""At once, d'ye hear,"". cried [Peter]_n1063 ,. ""or I'll plunge [my]_p2740 hook in you. ""This is queer!"". [Smee]_n1064 gasped. ""Better do what the captain orders,"". said [Starkey]_n1065 nervously.",3,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay, ay,"". [Smee]_n1066 said, and [he]_p2741 cut [Tiger Lily]_n1067 's cords. At once like an eel [she]_p2742 slid between [Starkey]_n1068 's legs into the water. Of course [Wendy]_n1069 was very elated over [Peter]_n1070 's cleverness but [she]_p2743 knew that [he]_p2744 would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, so at once [her]_p2745 hand went out to cover [his]_p2746 mouth. But [it]_p2747 was stayed even in the act, for. ""Boat ahoy!"". rang over the lagoon in [Hook]_n1071 's voice, and this time [it]_p2748 was not [Peter]_n1072 who had spoken. [Peter]_n1073 may have been about to crow, but [his]_p2749 face puckered in a whistle of surprise instead. ""Boat ahoy!"". again came the voice.",8,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," Now [Wendy]_n1074 understood. The real [Hook]_n1075 was also in the water. [He]_p2750 was swimming to the boat, and as [his]_p2751 men showed a light to guide [him]_p2752 [he]_p2753 had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern [Wendy]_n1076 saw [his]_p2754 hook grip the boat's side [she]_p2756 saw [his]_p2755 evil swarthy face as [he]_p2758 rose dripping from the water, and, quaking, [she]_p2757 would have liked to swim away, but [Peter]_n1077 would not budge. [He]_p2759 was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit. ""Am [I]_p2760 not a wonder, oh, [I]_p2761 am a wonder!"". [he]_p2762 whispered to her, and though [she]_p2763 thought so also, [she]_p2764 was really glad for the sake of [his]_p2765 reputation that no one heard [him]_p2766 except herself. [He]_p2767 signed to [her]_p2768 to listen. The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought [their]_p2769 captain to them, but [he]_p2770 sat with [his]_p2771 head on [his]_p2772 hook in a position of profound melancholy. ""[Captain]_n1078 , is all well?"".",5,,23,
barrie_peter_pan," [they]_p2773 asked timidly, but [he]_p2774 answered with a hollow moan. ""[He]_p2775 sighs,"". said [Smee]_n1079. ""[He]_p2776 sighs again,"". said [Starkey]_n1080. ""And yet a third time [he]_p2777 sighs,"". said [Smee]_n1081. Then at last [he]_p2778 spoke passionately. ""The game's up,"". [he]_p2779 cried,.",3,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""those boys have found a mother. Affrighted though [she]_p2780 was, [Wendy]_n1082 swelled with pride. ""O evil day!"". cried [Starkey]_n1083. ""What's a mother?"". asked the ignorant [Smee]_n1084. [Wendy]_n1085 was so shocked that [she]_p2781 exclaimed. ""[He]_p2782 doesn't know!"". and always after this [she]_p2783 felt that if [you]_p2784 could have a pet pirate [Smee]_n1086 would be [her]_p2785 one. [Peter]_n1087 pulled [her]_p2786 beneath the water, for [Hook]_n1088 had started up, crying,.",7,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""What was that?. ""[I]_p2787 heard nothing,"". said [Starkey]_n1089 , raising the lantern over the waters, and as the pirates looked [they]_p2788 saw a strange sight. [It]_p2789 was the nest [I]_p2790 have told [you]_p2791 of, floating on the lagoon, and the [Never]_n1090 bird was sitting on it. ""See,"". said [Hook]_n1091 in answer to [Smee]_n1092 's question,. ""that is a mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the mother desert [her]_p2792 eggs? No. There was a break in [his]_p2793 voice, as if for a moment [he]_p2795 recalled innocent days when, but [he]_p2796 brushed away this weakness with [his]_p2794 hook. [Smee]_n1093 , much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but the more suspicious [Starkey]_n1094 said,.",6,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""If [she]_p2797 is a mother, perhaps [she]_p2798 is hanging about here to help [Peter]_n1095. [Hook]_n1096 winced. ""Ay,"". [he]_p2799 said,. ""that is the fear that haunts me. [He]_p2800 was roused from this dejection by [Smee]_n1097 's eager voice. ""[Captain]_n1098 ,"". said [Smee]_n1099 ,. ""could [we]_p2801 not kidnap these boys' mother and make [her]_p2802 [our]_p2803 mother?. ""[It]_p2804 is a princely scheme,"".",5,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," cried [Hook]_n1100 , and at once [it]_p2805 took practical shape in [his]_p2806 great brain. ""[We]_p2807 will seize the children and carry [them]_p2808 to the boat: the boys [we]_p2809 will make walk the plank, and [Wendy]_n1101 shall be [our]_p2810 mother. Again [Wendy]_n1102 forgot herself. ""[Never]_n1103 !"". [she]_p2811 cried, and bobbed. ""What was that?   But [they]_p2812 could see nothing. [They]_p2813 thought [it]_p2814 must have been a leaf in the wind. ""Do [you]_p2815 agree, [my]_p2816 bullies?"". asked [Hook]_n1104. ""There is [my]_p2817 hand on it,"".",5,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [they]_p2818 both said. ""And there is [my]_p2819 hook. [Swear]_n1105. [They]_p2820 all swore. By this time [they]_p2821 were on the rock, and suddenly [Hook]_n1106 remembered [Tiger Lily]_n1107. ""Where is the redskin?"". [he]_p2822 demanded abruptly. [He]_p2823 had a playful humour at moments, and [they]_p2824 thought this was one of the moments. ""That is all right, captain,"". [Smee]_n1108 answered complacently.",4,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[we]_p2825 let [her]_p2826 go. ""Let [her]_p2827 go!"". cried [Hook]_n1109. "" Twas [your]_p2828 own orders,"". the bo'sun faltered. ""[You]_p2829 called over the water to [us]_p2830 to let [her]_p2831 go,"". said [Starkey]_n1110. ""[Brimstone]_n1111 and gall,"". thundered [Hook]_n1112 ,. ""what cozening [cheating] is going on here!"".",4,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [His]_p2832 face had gone black with rage, but [he]_p2833 saw that [they]_p2835 believed [their]_p2836 words, and [he]_p2834 was startled. ""Lads,"". [he]_p2837 said, shaking a little,. ""[I]_p2838 gave no such order. ""[It]_p2839 is passing queer,"". [Smee]_n1113 said, and [they]_p2840 all fidgeted uncomfortably. [Hook]_n1114 raised [his]_p2841 voice, but there was a quiver in it. ""Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon [to-night]_n1115 ,"". [he]_p2842 cried,. ""dost hear me? Of course [Peter]_n1116 should have kept quiet, but of course [he]_p2843 did not.",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p2844 immediately answered in [Hook]_n1117 's voice:. ""Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, [I]_p2845 hear you. In that supreme moment [Hook]_n1118 did not blanch, even at the gills, but [Smee]_n1119 and [Starkey]_n1120 clung to each other in terror. ""Who are you, stranger? Speak!"". [Hook]_n1121 demanded. ""[I]_p2846 am [James Hook]_n1122 ,"". replied the voice,. ""captain of the JOLLY [ROGER]_n1123. ""[You]_p2847 are not [you]_p2848 are not,"". [Hook]_n1124 cried hoarsely.",8,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Brimstone]_n1125 and gall,"". the voice retorted,. ""say that again, and I'll cast anchor in you. [Hook]_n1126 tried a more ingratiating manner. ""If [you]_p2849 are [Hook]_n1127 ,"". [he]_p2850 said almost humbly,. ""come tell me, who am I?. ""A codfish,"". replied the voice,. ""only a codfish.",3,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," ""A codfish!"". [Hook]_n1128 echoed blankly, and [it]_p2851 was then, but not till then, that [his]_p2852 proud spirit broke. [He]_p2853 saw [his]_p2854 men draw back from him. ""Have [we]_p2855 been captained all this time by a codfish!"". [they]_p2856 muttered. ""[It]_p2857 is lowering to [our]_p2858 pride. [They]_p2859 were [his]_p2860 dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though [he]_p2861 had become, [he]_p2862 scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence [it]_p2863 was not [their]_p2865 belief in [him]_p2866 that [he]_p2867 needed, [it]_p2864 was [his]_p2868 own. [He]_p2869 felt [his]_p2870 ego slipping from him. ""Don't desert me, bully,"".",1,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p2871 whispered hoarsely to it. In [his]_p2872 dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the great pirates, and [it]_p2873 sometimes gave [him]_p2874 intuitions. Suddenly [he]_p2875 tried the guessing game. ""[Hook]_n1129 ,"". [he]_p2876 called,. ""have [you]_p2877 another voice? Now [Peter]_n1130 could never resist a game, and [he]_p2878 answered blithely in [his]_p2879 own voice,. ""[I]_p2880 have. ""And another name?. ""Ay, ay. ""Vegetable?"".",2,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," asked [Hook]_n1131. ""No. ""[Mineral]_n1132 ?. ""No. ""[Animal]_n1133 ?. ""Yes. ""Man?. ""No!"". This answer rang out scornfully. ""[Boy]_n1134 ?.",4,,0,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes. ""Ordinary boy?. ""No!. ""Wonderful boy? To [Wendy]_n1135 's pain the answer that rang out this time was. ""Yes. ""Are [you]_p2881 in [England]_n1136 ?. ""No. ""Are [you]_p2882 here?. ""Yes. [Hook]_n1137 was completely puzzled.",3,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[You]_p2883 ask [him]_p2884 some questions,"". [he]_p2885 said to the others, wiping [his]_p2886 damp brow. [Smee]_n1138 reflected. ""[I]_p2887 can't think of a thing,"". [he]_p2888 said regretfully. ""Can't guess, can't guess!"". crowed [Peter]_n1139. ""Do [you]_p2889 give [it]_p2890 up?   Of course in [his]_p2891 pride [he]_p2892 was carrying the game too far, and the miscreants [villains] saw [their]_p2893 chance. ""Yes, yes,"". [they]_p2894 answered eagerly.",2,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Well, then,"". [he]_p2895 cried,. ""[I]_p2896 am [Peter Pan]_n1140. [Pan]_n1141 ! In a moment [Hook]_n1142 was [himself]_p2897 again, and [Smee]_n1143 and [Starkey]_n1144 were [his]_p2898 faithful henchmen. ""Now [we]_p2899 have him,"". [Hook]_n1145 shouted. ""Into the water, [Smee]_n1146. [Starkey]_n1147 , mind the boat. Take [him]_p2900 dead or alive! [He]_p2901 leaped as [he]_p2902 spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of [Peter]_n1148. ""Are [you]_p2903 ready, boys?.",9,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay, ay,"". from various parts of the lagoon. ""Then lam into the pirates. The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was [John]_n1149 , who gallantly climbed into the boat and held [Starkey]_n1150. There was fierce struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate's grasp. [He]_p2904 wriggled overboard and [John]_n1151 leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away. Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at [their]_p2905 own side.",3,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," The corkscrew of [Smee]_n1152 got [Tootles]_n1153 in the fourth rib, but [he]_p2906 was [himself]_p2907 pinked [nicked] in turn by [Curly]_n1154. [Farther]_n1155 from the rock [Starkey]_n1156 was pressing [Slightly]_n1157 and the twins hard. Where all this time was [Peter]_n1158 ? [He]_p2908 was seeking bigger game. The others were all brave boys, and [they]_p2909 must not be blamed for backing from the pirate captain. [His]_p2910 iron claw made a circle of dead water round him, from which [they]_p2911 fled like affrighted fishes. But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter that circle. Strangely, [it]_p2912 was not in the water that [they]_p2913 met. [Hook]_n1159 rose to the rock to breathe, and at the same moment [Peter]_n1160 scaled [it]_p2914 on the opposite side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and [they]_p2915 had to crawl rather than climb. Neither knew that the other was coming.",9,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," Each feeling for a grip met the other's arm: in surprise [they]_p2916 raised [their]_p2918 heads [their]_p2919 faces were almost touching so [they]_p2917 met. Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before [they]_p2920 fell to [began combat] [they]_p2921 had a sinking [feeling in the stomach]. Had [it]_p2922 been so with [Peter]_n1161 at that moment [I]_p2924 would admit it. After all, [he]_p2925 was the only man that the [Sea-Cook]_n1162 had feared. But [Peter]_n1163 had no sinking, [he]_p2926 had one feeling only, gladness and [he]_p2927 gnashed [his]_p2928 pretty teeth with joy. [Quick]_n1164 as thought [he]_p2929 snatched a knife from [Hook]_n1165 's belt and was about to drive [it]_p2932 home, when [he]_p2930 saw that [he]_p2930 was higher up the rock than [his]_p2933 foe. [It]_p2934 would not have been fighting fair. [He]_p2935 gave the pirate a hand to help [him]_p2936 up. [It]_p2937 was then that [Hook]_n1166 bit him. Not the pain of this but [its]_p2938 unfairness was what dazed [Peter]_n1167.",7,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p2939 made [him]_p2940 quite helpless. [He]_p2941 could only stare, horrified. Every child is affected thus the first time [he]_p2942 is treated unfairly. All [he]_p2943 thinks [he]_p2944 has a right to when [he]_p2944 comes to [you]_p2946 to be [yours]_p2947 is fairness. After [you]_p2948 have been unfair to [him]_p2950 [he]_p2951 will love [you]_p2949 again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first unfairness no one except [Peter]_n1168. [He]_p2952 often met it, but [he]_p2953 always forgot it. [I]_p2954 suppose that was the real difference between [him]_p2955 and all the rest. So when [he]_p2956 met [it]_p2958 now [it]_p2959 was like the first time and [he]_p2957 could just stare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.",1,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," A few moments afterwards the other boys saw [Hook]_n1169 in the water striking wildly for the ship no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering but now [they]_p2960 were uneasy, for [they]_p2961 had lost both [Peter]_n1170 and [Wendy]_n1171 , and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling [them]_p2962 by name. [They]_p2964 found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting. ""[Peter]_n1172 , [Wendy]_n1173"". as [they]_p2965 went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids. ""[They]_p2966 must be swimming back or flying,"". the boys concluded. [They]_p2967 were not very anxious, because [they]_p2968 had such faith in [Peter]_n1174. [They]_p2969 chuckled, [boylike]_n1175 , because [they]_p2970 would be late for bed and [it]_p2971 was all mother [Wendy]_n1176 's fault! When [their]_p2972 voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a feeble cry. ""Help, help!   Two small figures were beating against the rock the girl had fainted and lay on the boy's arm.",8,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," With a last effort [Peter]_n1177 pulled [her]_p2973 up the rock and then lay down beside her. Even as [he]_p2975 also fainted [he]_p2976 saw that the water was rising. [He]_p2977 knew that [they]_p2978 would soon be drowned, but [he]_p2979 could do no more. As [they]_p2980 lay side by side a mermaid caught [Wendy]_n1178 by the feet, and began pulling [her]_p2981 softly into the water. [Peter]_n1179 , feeling [her]_p2982 slip from him, woke with a start, and was just in time to draw [her]_p2983 back. But [he]_p2984 had to tell [her]_p2985 the truth. ""[We]_p2986 are on the rock, [Wendy]_n1180 ,"". [he]_p2987 said,. ""but [it]_p2988 is growing smaller. Soon the water will be over it.",4,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p2989 did not understand even now. ""[We]_p2990 must go,"". [she]_p2991 said, almost brightly. ""Yes,"". [he]_p2992 answered faintly. ""[Shall]_n1181 [we]_p2993 swim or fly, [Peter]_n1182 ? [He]_p2994 had to tell her. ""Do [you]_p2995 think [you]_p2996 could swim or fly as far as the island, [Wendy]_n1183 , without [my]_p2997 help? [She]_p2998 had to admit that [she]_p2999 was too tired. [He]_p3000 moaned. ""What is it?"". [she]_p3001 asked, anxious about [him]_p3002 at once.",3,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p3003 can't help you, [Wendy]_n1184. [Hook]_n1185 wounded me. [I]_p3004 can neither fly nor swim. ""Do [you]_p3005 mean [we]_p3006 shall both be drowned?. ""Look how the water is rising. [They]_p3007 put [their]_p3008 hands over [their]_p3009 eyes to shut out the sight. [They]_p3010 thought [they]_p3011 would soon be no more. As [they]_p3012 sat thus something brushed against [Peter]_n1186 as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly,. ""Can [I]_p3013 be of any use? [It]_p3014 was the tail of a kite, which [Michael]_n1187 had made some days before. [It]_p3015 had torn [itself]_p3016 out of [his]_p3017 hand and floated away.",4,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Michael]_n1188 's kite,"". [Peter]_n1189 said without interest, but next moment [he]_p3018 had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him. ""[It]_p3019 lifted [Michael]_n1190 off the ground,"". [he]_p3020 cried. ""why should [it]_p3021 not carry you?. ""Both of us!. ""[It]_p3022 can't lift two [Michael]_n1191 and [Curly]_n1192 tried. ""Let [us]_p3023 draw lots,"". [Wendy]_n1193 said bravely. ""And [you]_p3024 a [lady]_n1194 never.",7,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," "". Already [he]_p3025 had tied the tail round her. [She]_p3026 clung to [him]_p3027 [she]_p3029 refused to go without [him]_p3028 but with a. ""Good-bye, [Wendy]_n1195 ,"". [he]_p3030 pushed [her]_p3031 from the rock and in a few minutes [she]_p3032 was borne out of [his]_p3033 sight. [Peter]_n1196 was alone on the lagoon. The rock was very small now soon [it]_p3034 would be submerged. Pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling to the moon. [Peter]_n1197 was not quite like other boys but [he]_p3035 was afraid at last. A tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and [Peter]_n1198 felt just the one.",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [Next]_n1199 moment [he]_p3036 was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on [his]_p3037 face and a drum beating within him. [It]_p3038 was saying,. ""To die will be an awfully big adventure. Chapter 9 THE NEVER BIRD The last sound [Peter]_n1200 heard before [he]_p3039 was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to [their]_p3040 bedchambers under the sea. [He]_p3041 was too far away to hear [their]_p3042 doors shut but every door in the coral caves where [they]_p3043 live rings a tiny bell when [it]_p3044 opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on the mainland), and [he]_p3045 heard the bells. Steadily the waters rose till [they]_p3046 were nibbling at [his]_p3048 feet and to pass the time until [they]_p3047 made [their]_p3049 final gulp, [he]_p3050 watched the only thing on the lagoon. [He]_p3051 thought [it]_p3052 was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long [it]_p3053 would take to drift [ashore]_n1201. Presently [he]_p3054 noticed as an odd thing that [it]_p3055 was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for [it]_p3056 was fighting the tide, and sometimes winning and when [it]_p3056 won, [Peter]_n1202 , always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping [it]_p3057 was such a gallant piece of paper. [It]_p3059 was not really a piece of paper [it]_p3060 was the [Never]_n1203 bird, making desperate efforts to reach [Peter]_n1204 on the nest. By working [her]_p3061 wings, in a way [she]_p3064 had learned since the nest fell into the water, [she]_p3065 was able to some extent to guide [her]_p3062 strange craft, but by the time [Peter]_n1205 recognised [her]_p3062 [she]_p3065 was very exhausted.",7,,31,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p3067 had come to save him, to give [him]_p3068 [her]_p3070 nest, though there were eggs in it. [I]_p3071 rather wonder at the bird, for though [he]_p3072 had been nice to her, [he]_p3073 had also sometimes tormented her. [I]_p3074 can suppose only that, like [Mrs Darling]_n1206 and the rest of them, [she]_p3075 was melted because [he]_p3076 had all [his]_p3077 first teeth. [She]_p3078 called out to [him]_p3079 what [she]_p3080 had come for, and [he]_p3082 called out to [her]_p3083 what [she]_p3081 was doing there but of course neither of [them]_p3084 understood the other's language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and [I]_p3085 wish for the moment [I]_p3086 could pretend that this were such a story, and say that [Peter]_n1207 replied intelligently to the [Never]_n1208 bird but truth is best, and [I]_p3086 want to tell [you]_p3088 only what really happened. Well, not only could [they]_p3089 not understand each other, but [they]_p3090 forgot [their]_p3091 manners. ""I, want, you, to, get, into, the, nest,"". the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible,. ""and, then, you, can, drift, [ashore]_n1209 , but, I, am, too, tired, to, bring, it, any, nearer, so, you, must, try to, swim, to, it. ""What are [you]_p3092 quacking about?"".",4,,25,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n1210 answered. ""Why don't [you]_p3093 let the nest drift as usual?. ""I, want, you, "". the bird said, and repeated [it]_p3094 all over. Then [Peter]_n1211 tried slow and distinct. ""What, are, you, quacking, about?"". and so on. The [Never]_n1212 bird became irritated [they]_p3095 have very short tempers. ""[You]_p3096 dunderheaded little jay!"". [she]_p3097 screamed,.",3,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Why don't [you]_p3098 do as [I]_p3100 tell you? [Peter]_n1213 felt that [she]_p3101 was calling [him]_p3102 names, and at a venture [he]_p3103 retorted hotly:. ""So are you!   Then rather curiously [they]_p3104 both snapped out the same remark:. ""Shut up!. ""Shut up!   Nevertheless the bird was determined to save [him]_p3105 if [she]_p3106 could, and by one last mighty effort [she]_p3107 propelled the nest against the rock. Then up [she]_p3108 flew deserting [her]_p3109 eggs, so as to make [her]_p3110 meaning clear. Then at last [he]_p3111 understood, and clutched the nest and waved [his]_p3112 thanks to the bird as [she]_p3113 fluttered overhead. [It]_p3114 was not to receive [his]_p3115 thanks, however, that [she]_p3116 hung there in the sky [it]_p3117 was not even to watch [him]_p3119 get into the nest [it]_p3118 was to see what [he]_p3120 did with [her]_p3121 eggs. There were two large white eggs, and [Peter]_n1214 lifted [them]_p3122 up and reflected. The bird covered [her]_p3123 face with [her]_p3124 wings, so as not to see the last of [them]_p3125 but [she]_p3126 could not help peeping between the feathers. [I]_p3127 forget whether [I]_p3128 have told [you]_p3129 that there was a stave on the rock, driven into [it]_p3130 by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure.",2,,32,
barrie_peter_pan," The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon [them]_p3131 for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them. The stave was still there, and on [it]_p3133 [Starkey]_n1215 had hung [his]_p3134 hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. [Peter]_n1216 put the eggs into this hat and set [it]_p3135 on the lagoon. [It]_p3136 floated beautifully. The [Never]_n1217 bird saw at once what [he]_p3137 was up to, and screamed [her]_p3138 admiration of [him]_p3140 and, alas, [Peter]_n1218 crowed [his]_p3141 agreement with her. Then [he]_p3142 got into the nest, reared the stave in [it]_p3143 as a mast, and hung up [his]_p3144 shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on [her]_p3145 eggs. [She]_p3146 drifted in one direction, and [he]_p3147 was borne off in another, both cheering. Of course when [Peter]_n1219 landed [he]_p3148 beached [his]_p3149 barque [small ship, actually the [Never Bird]_n1220 's nest in this particular case in point] in a place where the bird would easily find [it]_p3150 but the hat was such a great success that [she]_p3151 abandoned the nest. [It]_p3152 drifted about till [it]_p3153 went to pieces, and often [Starkey]_n1221 came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on [his]_p3154 hat.",7,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," As [we]_p3155 shall not see [her]_p3156 again, [it]_p3157 may be worth mentioning here that all [Never]_n1222 birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing. [Great]_n1223 were the rejoicings when [Peter]_n1224 reached the home under the ground almost as soon as [Wendy]_n1225 , who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that [they]_p3158 were several hours late for bed. This so inflated [them]_p3159 that [they]_p3161 did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages but [Wendy]_n1226 , though glorying in having [them]_p3160 all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried,. ""To bed, to bed,"". in a voice that had to be obeyed. [Next]_n1227 day, however, [she]_p3162 was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and [they]_p3163 played till bed-time at limping about and carrying [their]_p3164 arms in slings. Chapter 10 THE [HAPPY]_n1228 HOME [One]_n1229 important result of the brush [with the pirates] on the lagoon was that [it]_p3165 made the redskins [their]_p3166 friends. [Peter]_n1230 had saved [Tiger Lily]_n1231 from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing [she]_p3167 and [her]_p3168 braves would not do for him. All night [they]_p3169 sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed.",10,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," Even by day [they]_p3170 hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if [they]_p3171 wanted tit-bits to eat. [They]_p3172 called [Peter]_n1232 the [Great White Father]_n1233 , prostrating [themselves]_p3173 [lying down] before [him]_p3174 and [he]_p3176 liked this tremendously, so that [it]_p3177 was not really good for him. ""The great white father,"". [he]_p3178 would say to [them]_p3179 in a very lordly manner, as [they]_p3180 grovelled at [his]_p3181 feet,. ""is glad to see the [Piccaninny]_n1234 warriors protecting [his]_p3182 wigwam from the pirates. ""[Me]_p3183 [Tiger Lily]_n1235 ,"". that lovely creature would reply. ""[Peter Pan]_n1236 save me, [me]_p3184 [his]_p3186 velly nice friend. [Me]_p3187 no let pirates hurt him. [She]_p3188 was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but [Peter]_n1237 thought [it]_p3189 [his]_p3190 due, and [he]_p3191 would answer condescendingly,.",6,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[It]_p3192 is good. [Peter Pan]_n1238 has spoken. Always when [he]_p3193 said,. ""[Peter Pan]_n1239 has spoken,"". [it]_p3194 meant that [they]_p3196 must now shut up, and [they]_p3197 accepted [it]_p3195 humbly in that spirit but [they]_p3197 were by no means so respectful to the other boys, whom [they]_p3198 looked upon as just ordinary braves. [They]_p3200 said. ""[How-do]_n1240 ?"". to them, and things like that and what annoyed the boys was that [Peter]_n1241 seemed to think this all right. Secretly [Wendy]_n1242 sympathised with [them]_p3201 a little, but [she]_p3202 was far too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father. ""[Father]_n1243 knows best,"".",6,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p3203 always said, whatever [her]_p3204 private opinion must be. [Her]_p3205 private opinion was that the redskins should not call [her]_p3206 a squaw. [We]_p3207 have now reached the evening that was to be known among [them]_p3208 as the [Night]_n1244 of Nights, because of [its]_p3209 adventures and [their]_p3210 upshot. The day, as if quietly gathering [its]_p3211 forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in [their]_p3212 blankets were at [their]_p3213 posts above, while, below, the children were having [their]_p3213 evening meal all except [Peter]_n1245 , who had gone out to get the time. The way [you]_p3215 got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near [him]_p3216 till the clock struck. The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and [they]_p3217 sat around the board, guzzling in [their]_p3218 greed and really, what with [their]_p3219 chatter and recriminations, the noise, as [Wendy]_n1246 said, was positively deafening. To be sure, [she]_p3220 did not mind noise, but [she]_p3221 simply would not have [them]_p3222 grabbing things, and then excusing [themselves]_p3223 by saying that [Tootles]_n1247 had pushed [their]_p3224 elbow. There was a fixed rule that [they]_p3225 must never hit back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to [Wendy]_n1248 by raising the right arm politely and saying,. ""[I]_p3226 complain of so-and-so "". but what usually happened was that [they]_p3227 forgot to do this or did [it]_p3228 too much.",5,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Silence,"". cried [Wendy]_n1249 when for the twentieth time [she]_p3229 had told [them]_p3230 that [they]_p3231 were not all to speak at once. ""Is [your]_p3232 mug empty, [Slightly]_n1250 darling?. ""Not quite empty, [mummy]_n1251 ,"". [Slightly]_n1252 said, after looking into an imaginary mug. ""[He]_p3233 hasn't even begun to drink [his]_p3234 milk,"". [Nibs]_n1253 interposed. This was telling, and [Slightly]_n1254 seized [his]_p3235 chance. ""[I]_p3236 complain of [Nibs]_n1255 ,"". [he]_p3237 cried promptly.",7,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," [John]_n1256 , however, had held up [his]_p3238 hand first. ""Well, [John]_n1257 ?. ""May [I]_p3239 sit in [Peter]_n1258 's chair, as [he]_p3240 is not here?. ""Sit in father's chair, [John]_n1259 !"". [Wendy]_n1260 was scandalised. ""Certainly not. ""[He]_p3241 is not really [our]_p3242 father,"". [John]_n1261 answered. ""[He]_p3243 didn't even know how a father does till [I]_p3244 showed him. This was grumbling.",6,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[We]_p3245 complain of [John]_n1262 ,"". cried the twins. [Tootles]_n1263 held up [his]_p3246 hand. [He]_p3247 was so much the humblest of them, indeed [he]_p3248 was the only humble one, that [Wendy]_n1264 was specially gentle with him. ""[I]_p3249 don't suppose,"". [Tootles]_n1265 said diffidently [bashfully or timidly],. ""that [I]_p3250 could be father. ""No, [Tootles]_n1266. Once [Tootles]_n1267 began, which was not very often, [he]_p3251 had a silly way of going on. ""As [I]_p3252 can't be father,"".",6,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p3253 said heavily,. ""[I]_p3254 don't suppose, [Michael]_n1268 , [you]_p3255 would let [me]_p3256 be baby?. ""No, [I]_p3257 won't,"". [Michael]_n1269 rapped out. [He]_p3258 was already in [his]_p3259 basket. ""As [I]_p3260 can't be baby,"". [Tootles]_n1270 said, getting heavier and heavier and heavier,. ""do [you]_p3261 think [I]_p3262 could be a twin?. ""No, indeed,"". replied the twins.",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""it's awfully difficult to be a twin. ""As [I]_p3263 can't be anything important,"". said [Tootles]_n1271 ,. ""would any of [you]_p3264 like to see [me]_p3265 do a trick?. ""No,"". [they]_p3266 all replied. Then at last [he]_p3267 stopped. ""[I]_p3268 hadn't really any hope,"". [he]_p3269 said. The hateful telling broke out again.",1,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Slightly]_n1272 is coughing on the table. ""The twins began with cheese-cakes. ""[Curly]_n1273 is taking both butter and honey. ""[Nibs]_n1274 is speaking with [his]_p3270 mouth full. ""[I]_p3271 complain of the twins. ""[I]_p3272 complain of [Curly]_n1275. ""[I]_p3273 complain of [Nibs]_n1276. ""Oh dear, oh dear,"". cried [Wendy]_n1277 ,. ""I'm sure [I]_p3274 sometimes think that spinsters are to be envied.",6,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p3276 told [them]_p3277 to clear away, and sat down to [her]_p3278 work-basket, a heavy load of stockings and every knee with a hole in [it]_p3279 as usual. ""[Wendy]_n1278 ,"". remonstrated [scolded] [Michael]_n1279 ,. ""I'm too big for a cradle. ""[I]_p3280 must have somebody in a cradle,"". [she]_p3281 said almost tartly,. ""and [you]_p3282 are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a house. While [she]_p3283 sewed [they]_p3284 played around [her]_p3285 such a group of happy faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. [It]_p3286 had become a very familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but [we]_p3287 are looking on [it]_p3288 for the last time.",2,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," There was a step above, and [Wendy]_n1280 , [you]_p3289 may be sure, was the first to recognize it. ""Children, [I]_p3290 hear [your]_p3291 father's step. [He]_p3292 likes [you]_p3293 to meet [him]_p3294 at the door. Above, the redskins crouched before [Peter]_n1281. ""Watch well, braves. [I]_p3295 have spoken. And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged [him]_p3296 from [his]_p3297 tree. As so often before, but never again. [He]_p3298 had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for [Wendy]_n1282. ""[Peter]_n1283 , [you]_p3299 just spoil them, [you]_p3300 know,"".",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [Wendy]_n1284 simpered [exaggerated a smile]. ""Ah, old [lady]_n1285 ,"". said [Peter]_n1286 , hanging up [his]_p3301 gun. ""[It]_p3302 was [me]_p3303 told [him]_p3304 mothers are called old [lady]_n1287 ,"". [Michael]_n1288 whispered to [Curly]_n1289. ""[I]_p3305 complain of [Michael]_n1290 ,"". said [Curly]_n1291 instantly. The first twin came to [Peter]_n1292. ""[Father]_n1293 , [we]_p3306 want to dance. ""Dance away, [my]_p3307 little man,"".",10,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Peter]_n1294 , who was in high good humour. ""But [we]_p3308 want [you]_p3309 to dance. [Peter]_n1295 was really the best dancer among them, but [he]_p3310 pretended to be scandalised. ""Me! [My]_p3311 old bones would rattle!. ""And [mummy]_n1296 too. ""What,"". cried [Wendy]_n1297 ,. ""the mother of such an armful, dance!. ""But on a [Saturday]_n1298 night,"". [Slightly]_n1299 insinuated.",6,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p3312 was not really [Saturday]_n1300 night, at least [it]_p3313 may have been, for [they]_p3315 had long lost count of the days but always if [they]_p3316 wanted to do anything special [they]_p3316 said this was [Saturday]_n1301 night, and then [they]_p3317 did it. ""Of course [it]_p3319 is [Saturday]_n1302 night, [Peter]_n1303 ,"". [Wendy]_n1304 said, relenting. ""People of [our]_p3320 figure, [Wendy]_n1305 !. ""But [it]_p3321 is only among [our]_p3322 own progeny [children]. ""True, true. So [they]_p3323 were told [they]_p3324 could dance, but [they]_p3324 must put on [their]_p3326 nighties first. ""Ah, old [lady]_n1306 ,"". [Peter]_n1307 said aside to [Wendy]_n1308 , warming [himself]_p3327 by the fire and looking down at [her]_p3328 as [she]_p3329 sat turning a heel,. ""there is nothing more pleasant of an evening for [you]_p3330 and [me]_p3331 when the day's toil is over than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.",9,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[It]_p3332 is sweet, [Peter]_n1309 , isn't it?"". [Wendy]_n1310 said, frightfully gratified. ""[Peter]_n1311 , [I]_p3333 think [Curly]_n1312 has [your]_p3334 nose. ""[Michael]_n1313 takes after you. [She]_p3335 went to [him]_p3336 and put [her]_p3337 hand on [his]_p3338 shoulder. ""[Dear Peter]_n1314 ,"". [she]_p3339 said,. ""with such a large family, of course, [I]_p3340 have now passed [my]_p3341 best, but [you]_p3342 don't want to [ex]change me, do you?. ""No, [Wendy]_n1315. Certainly [he]_p3344 did not want a change, but [he]_p3345 looked at [her]_p3347 uncomfortably, blinking, [you]_p3348 know, like one not sure whether [he]_p3345 was awake or [asleep]_n1316.",8,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Peter]_n1317 , what is it?. ""[I]_p3349 was just thinking,"". [he]_p3350 said, a little scared. ""[It]_p3351 is only make-believe, isn't it, that [I]_p3352 am [their]_p3353 father?. ""Oh yes,"". [Wendy]_n1318 said primly [formally and properly]. ""[You]_p3354 see,"". [he]_p3355 continued apologetically,. ""[it]_p3356 would make [me]_p3357 seem so old to be [their]_p3358 real father. ""But [they]_p3359 are ours, [Peter]_n1319 , [yours]_p3360 and mine.",3,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""But not really, [Wendy]_n1320 ?"". [he]_p3361 asked anxiously. ""Not if [you]_p3362 don't wish it,"". [she]_p3363 replied and [she]_p3364 distinctly heard [his]_p3365 sigh of relief. ""[Peter]_n1321 ,"". [she]_p3366 asked, trying to speak firmly,. ""what are [your]_p3367 exact feelings to [about] me?. ""Those of a devoted son, [Wendy]_n1322. ""[I]_p3368 thought so,"". [she]_p3369 said, and went and sat by [herself]_p3370 at the extreme end of the room.",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[You]_p3371 are so queer,"". [he]_p3372 said, frankly puzzled,. ""and [Tiger Lily]_n1323 is just the same. There is something [she]_p3373 wants to be to me, but [she]_p3374 says [it]_p3375 is not [my]_p3376 mother. ""No, indeed, [it]_p3377 is not,"". [Wendy]_n1324 replied with frightful emphasis. Now [we]_p3378 know why [she]_p3379 was prejudiced against the redskins. ""Then what is it?. ""[It]_p3380 isn't for a [lady]_n1325 to tell. ""Oh, very well,"".",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n1326 said, a little nettled. ""Perhaps [Tinker Bell]_n1327 will tell me. ""Oh yes, [Tinker Bell]_n1328 will tell you,"". [Wendy]_n1329 retorted scornfully. ""[She]_p3381 is an abandoned little creature. Here [Tink]_n1330 , who was in [her]_p3382 bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something impudent. ""[She]_p3383 says [she]_p3384 glories in being abandoned,"". [Peter]_n1331 interpreted. [He]_p3385 had a sudden idea. ""Perhaps [Tink]_n1332 wants to be [my]_p3386 mother?.",7,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[You]_p3387 silly ass!"". cried [Tinker Bell]_n1333 in a passion. [She]_p3388 had said [it]_p3389 so often that [Wendy]_n1334 needed no translation. ""[I]_p3390 almost agree with her,"". [Wendy]_n1335 snapped. Fancy [Wendy]_n1336 snapping! But [she]_p3391 had been much tried, and [she]_p3392 little knew what was to happen before the night was out. If [she]_p3393 had known [she]_p3394 would not have snapped. None of [them]_p3395 knew. Perhaps [it]_p3396 was best not to know. [Their]_p3397 ignorance gave [them]_p3398 one more glad hour and as [it]_p3399 was to be [their]_p3401 last hour on the island, let [us]_p3402 rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it.",4,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p3403 sang and danced in [their]_p3404 night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song [it]_p3405 was, in which [they]_p3406 pretended to be frightened at [their]_p3408 own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom [they]_p3407 would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the dance, and how [they]_p3409 buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! [It]_p3413 was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when [it]_p3411 was finished, the pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that [they]_p3410 may never meet again. The stories [they]_p3414 told, before [it]_p3415 was time for [Wendy]_n1337 's good-night story! Even [Slightly]_n1338 tried to tell a story that night, but the beginning was so fearfully dull that [it]_p3416 appalled not only the others but himself, and [he]_p3417 said gloomily:. ""Yes, [it]_p3418 is a dull beginning. [I]_p3419 say, let [us]_p3420 pretend that [it]_p3421 is the end. And then at last [they]_p3422 all got into bed for [Wendy]_n1339 's story, the story [they]_p3423 loved best, the story [Peter]_n1340 hated. Usually when [she]_p3424 began to tell this story [he]_p3425 left the room or put [his]_p3427 hands over [his]_p3428 ears and possibly if [he]_p3426 had done either of those things this time [they]_p3429 might all still be on the island. But [to-night]_n1341 [he]_p3430 remained on [his]_p3431 stool and [we]_p3432 shall see what happened. Chapter 11 [WENDY]_n1342 'S STORY.",6,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Listen]_n1343 , then,"". said [Wendy]_n1344 , settling down to [her]_p3433 story, with [Michael]_n1345 at [her]_p3434 feet and seven boys in the bed. ""There was once a gentleman,. ""[I]_p3435 had rather [he]_p3436 had been a [lady]_n1346 ,"". [Curly]_n1347 said. ""[I]_p3437 wish [he]_p3438 had been a white rat,"". said [Nibs]_n1348.

[Peter]_n1357 called out, determined that [she]_p3450 should have fair play, however beastly a story [it]_p3451 might be in [his]_p3452 opinion. ""The gentleman's name,"". [Wendy]_n1358 continued,. ""was [Mr Darling]_n1359 , and [her]_p3453 name was [Mrs Darling]_n1360. ""[I]_p3454 knew them,"".",5,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [John]_n1361 said, to annoy the others. ""[I]_p3455 think [I]_p3456 knew them,"". said [Michael]_n1362 rather doubtfully. ""[They]_p3457 were married, [you]_p3458 know,"". explained [Wendy]_n1363 ,. ""and what do [you]_p3459 think [they]_p3460 had?. ""White rats,"". cried [Nibs]_n1364 , inspired. ""No. ""It's awfully puzzling,"".",4,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Tootles]_n1365 , who knew the story by heart. ""[Quiet]_n1366 , [Tootles]_n1367. [They]_p3461 had three descendants. ""What is descendants?.

barrie_peter_pan," ""Now these three children had a faithful nurse called [Nana]_n1372 but [Mr Darling]_n1373 was angry with [her]_p3465 and chained [her]_p3466 up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.

barrie_peter_pan," ""Oo!. ""It's awfully sad,"". the first twin said cheerfully. ""[I]_p3482 don't see how [it]_p3483 can have a happy ending,"". said the second twin. ""Do you, [Nibs]_n1384 ?. ""I'm frightfully anxious. ""If [you]_p3484 knew how great is a mother's love,"". [Wendy]_n1385 told [them]_p3485 triumphantly,. ""[you]_p3486 would have no fear.",2,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," "". [She]_p3487 had now come to the part that [Peter]_n1386 hated. ""[I]_p3488 do like a mother's love,"". said [Tootles]_n1387 , hitting [Nibs]_n1388 with a pillow. ""Do [you]_p3489 like a mother's love, [Nibs]_n1389 ?. ""[I]_p3490 do just,"". said [Nibs]_n1390 , hitting back. ""[You]_p3491 see,"". [Wendy]_n1391 said complacently,. ""[our]_p3492 heroine knew that the mother would always leave the window open for [her]_p3493 children to fly back by so [they]_p3494 stayed away for years and had a lovely time.",6,,8,

""take a peep into the future "". and [they]_p3499 all gave [themselves]_p3500 the twist that makes peeps into the future easier. ""Years have rolled by, and who is this elegant [lady]_n1393 of uncertain age alighting at [London Station]_n1394 ?. ""O [Wendy]_n1395 , who is she?"". cried [Nibs]_n1396 , every bit as excited as if [he]_p3501 didn't know. ""Can [it]_p3502 be, yes, no, [it]_p3503 is, the fair [Wendy]_n1397 !. ""Oh!.",6,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown to man's estate? Can [they]_p3504 be [John]_n1398 and [Michael]_n1399 ? [They]_p3505 are!. ""Oh!. ""See, dear brothers,' says [Wendy]_n1400 pointing upwards, there is the window still standing open. Ah, now [we]_p3506 are rewarded for [our]_p3507 sublime faith in a mother's love. ' So up [they]_p3508 flew to [their]_p3509 [mummy]_n1401 and daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which [we]_p3510 draw a veil. That was the story, and [they]_p3511 were as pleased with [it]_p3512 as the fair narrator herself. Everything just as [it]_p3513 should be, [you]_p3514 see. Off [we]_p3515 skip like the most heartless things in the world, which is what children are, but so attractive and [we]_p3516 have an entirely selfish time, and then when [we]_p3516 have need of special attention [we]_p3517 nobly return for it, confident that [we]_p3517 shall be rewarded instead of smacked. So great indeed was [their]_p3520 faith in a mother's love that [they]_p3521 felt [they]_p3522 could afford to be callous for a bit longer. But there was one there who knew better, and when [Wendy]_n1402 finished [he]_p3523 uttered a hollow groan.",5,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," ""What is it, [Peter]_n1403 ?"". [she]_p3524 cried, running to him, thinking [he]_p3525 was ill. [She]_p3526 felt [him]_p3527 solicitously, lower down than [his]_p3528 chest. ""Where is it, [Peter]_n1404 ?. ""[It]_p3529 isn't that kind of pain,"". [Peter]_n1405 replied darkly. ""Then what kind is it?. ""[Wendy]_n1406 , [you]_p3530 are wrong about mothers. [They]_p3531 all gathered round [him]_p3532 in affright, so alarming was [his]_p3533 agitation  and with a fine candour [he]_p3534 told [them]_p3536 what [he]_p3535 had hitherto concealed. ""Long ago,"".",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p3537 said,. ""[I]_p3538 thought like [you]_p3540 that [my]_p3541 mother would always keep the window open for me, so [I]_p3539 stayed away for moons and moons and moons, and then flew back but the window was barred, for mother had forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in [my]_p3542 bed. [I]_p3543 am not sure that this was true, but [Peter]_n1407 thought [it]_p3544 was true and [it]_p3545 scared them. ""Are [you]_p3546 sure mothers are like that?. ""Yes. So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!  Still [it]_p3547 is best to be careful and no one knows so quickly as a child when [he]_p3548 should give in. ""[Wendy]_n1408 , let [us]_p3549 [let's] go home,"". cried [John]_n1409 and [Michael]_n1410 together. ""Yes,"".",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p3550 said, clutching them. ""Not [to-night]_n1411 ?"". asked the lost boys bewildered. [They]_p3551 knew in what [they]_p3552 called [their]_p3553 hearts that [one]_p3554 can get on quite well without a mother, and that [it]_p3555 is only the mothers who think [you]_p3556 can't. ""At once,"". [Wendy]_n1412 replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come to her:. ""Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time. This dread made [her]_p3557 forgetful of what must be [Peter]_n1413 's feelings, and [she]_p3558 said to [him]_p3559 rather sharply,. ""[Peter]_n1414 , will [you]_p3560 make the necessary arrangements?. ""If [you]_p3561 wish it,"".",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p3562 replied, as coolly as if [she]_p3563 had asked [him]_p3564 to pass the nuts. Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If [she]_p3565 did not mind the parting, [he]_p3566 was going to show her, was [Peter]_n1415 , that neither did he. But of course [he]_p3568 cared very much and [he]_p3569 was so full of wrath against grown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as [he]_p3569 got inside [his]_p3572 tree [he]_p3570 breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate of about five to a second. [He]_p3573 did this because there is a saying in the [Neverland]_n1416 that, every time [you]_p3574 breathe, a grown-up dies and Peter was killing [them]_p3575 off vindictively as fast as possible. Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins [he]_p3576 returned to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in [his]_p3577 absence. Panic-stricken at the thought of losing [Wendy]_n1417 the lost boys had advanced upon [her]_p3578 threateningly. ""[It]_p3579 will be worse than before [she]_p3580 came,"". [they]_p3581 cried. ""[We]_p3582 shan't let [her]_p3583 go. ""Let's keep [her]_p3584 prisoner.",3,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay, chain [her]_p3585 up. In [her]_p3586 extremity an instinct told [her]_p3587 to which of [them]_p3588 to turn. ""[Tootles]_n1418 ,"". [she]_p3589 cried,. ""[I]_p3590 appeal to you. Was [it]_p3591 not strange? [She]_p3592 appealed to [Tootles]_n1419 , quite the silliest one. Grandly, however, did [Tootles]_n1420 respond. For that one moment [he]_p3593 dropped [his]_p3594 silliness and spoke with dignity. ""[I]_p3595 am just [Tootles]_n1421 ,"". [he]_p3596 said,.",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""and nobody minds me. But the first who does not behave to [Wendy]_n1422 like an [English]_n1423 gentleman [I]_p3597 will blood [him]_p3598 severely. [He]_p3599 drew back [his]_p3600 hanger and for that instant [his]_p3601 sun was at noon. The others held back uneasily. Then [Peter]_n1424 returned, and [they]_p3602 saw at once that [they]_p3603 would get no support from him. [He]_p3604 would keep no girl in the [Neverland]_n1425 against [her]_p3605 will. ""[Wendy]_n1426 ,"". [he]_p3606 said, striding up and down,. ""[I]_p3607 have asked the redskins to guide [you]_p3608 through the wood, as flying tires [you]_p3609 so. ""Thank you, [Peter]_n1427.",6,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Then,"". [he]_p3610 continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be obeyed,. ""[Tinker Bell]_n1428 will take [you]_p3611 across the sea. Wake her, [Nibs]_n1429. [Nibs]_n1430 had to knock twice before [he]_p3612 got an answer, though [Tink]_n1431 had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time. ""Who are you? How dare you? Go away,"". [she]_p3613 cried. ""[You]_p3614 are to get up, [Tink]_n1432 ,"". [Nibs]_n1433 called,. ""and take [Wendy]_n1434 on a journey.",7,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course [Tink]_n1435 had been delighted to hear that [Wendy]_n1436 was going but [she]_p3615 was jolly well determined not to be [her]_p3617 courier, and [she]_p3616 said so in still more offensive language. Then [she]_p3618 pretended to be [asleep]_n1437 again. ""[She]_p3619 says [she]_p3620 won't!"". [Nibs]_n1438 exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination, [whereupon Peter]_n1439 went sternly toward the young [lady]_n1440 's chamber. ""[Tink]_n1441 ,"". [he]_p3621 rapped out,. ""if [you]_p3622 don't get up and dress at once [I]_p3624 will open the curtains, and then [we]_p3625 shall all see [you]_p3623 in [your]_p3626 negligee [nightgown]. This made [her]_p3627 leap to the floor. ""Who said [I]_p3628 wasn't getting up?"". [she]_p3629 cried.",7,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at [Wendy]_n1442 , now equipped with [John]_n1443 and [Michael]_n1444 for the journey. By this time [they]_p3630 were dejected, not merely because [they]_p3631 were about to lose her, but also because [they]_p3631 felt that [she]_p3634 was going off to something nice to which [they]_p3632 had not been invited. [Novelty]_n1445 was beckoning to [them]_p3635 as usual. Crediting [them]_p3636 with a nobler feeling [Wendy]_n1446 melted. ""Dear ones,"". [she]_p3637 said,. ""if [you]_p3638 will all come with [me]_p3640 [I]_p3641 feel almost sure [I]_p3642 can get [my]_p3643 father and mother to adopt you. The invitation was meant specially for [Peter]_n1447 , but each of the boys was thinking exclusively of himself, and at once [they]_p3644 jumped with joy. ""But won't [they]_p3645 think [us]_p3646 rather a handful?"". [Nibs]_n1448 asked in the middle of [his]_p3647 jump.",7,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Oh no,"". said [Wendy]_n1449 , rapidly thinking [it]_p3648 out,. ""[it]_p3649 will only mean having a few beds in the drawing-room [they]_p3650 can be hidden behind the screens on first Thursdays. ""[Peter]_n1450 , can [we]_p3651 go?"". [they]_p3652 all cried imploringly. [They]_p3653 took [it]_p3654 for granted that if [they]_p3655 went [he]_p3657 would go also, but really [they]_p3656 scarcely cared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert [their]_p3658 dearest ones. ""All right,"". [Peter]_n1451 replied with a bitter smile, and immediately [they]_p3659 rushed to get [their]_p3660 things. ""And now, [Peter]_n1452 ,"".",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [Wendy]_n1453 said, thinking [she]_p3661 had put everything right,. ""[I]_p3662 am going to give [you]_p3663 [your]_p3665 medicine before [you]_p3664 go. "". [She]_p3666 loved to give [them]_p3667 medicine, and undoubtedly gave [them]_p3668 too much. Of course [it]_p3669 was only water, but [it]_p3670 was out of a bottle, and [she]_p3672 always shook the bottle and counted the drops, which gave [it]_p3670 a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion, however, [she]_p3673 did not give [Peter]_n1454 [his]_p3676 draught [portion], for just as [she]_p3674 had prepared it, [she]_p3674 saw a look on [his]_p3677 face that made [her]_p3678 heart sink. ""Get [your]_p3679 things, [Peter]_n1455 ,"". [she]_p3680 cried, shaking. ""No,"". [he]_p3681 answered, pretending indifference,.",3,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p3682 am not going with you, [Wendy]_n1456. ""Yes, [Peter]_n1457. ""No. To show that [her]_p3683 departure would leave [him]_p3684 unmoved, [he]_p3685 skipped up and down the room, playing gaily on [his]_p3686 heartless pipes. [She]_p3687 had to run about after him, though [it]_p3688 was rather undignified. ""To find [your]_p3689 mother,"". [she]_p3690 coaxed. Now, if [Peter]_n1458 had ever quite had a mother, [he]_p3691 no longer missed her. [He]_p3692 could do very well without one. [He]_p3693 had thought [them]_p3694 out, and remembered only [their]_p3695 bad points.",3,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No, no,"". [he]_p3696 told [Wendy]_n1459 decisively. ""perhaps [she]_p3697 would say [I]_p3698 was old, and [I]_p3699 just want always to be a little boy and to have fun. ""But, [Peter]_n1460 ,. ""No. And so the others had to be told. ""[Peter]_n1461 isn't coming. [Peter]_n1462 not coming! [They]_p3700 gazed blankly at him, [their]_p3701 sticks over [their]_p3702 backs, and on each stick a bundle. [Their]_p3703 first thought was that if [Peter]_n1463 was not going [he]_p3704 had probably changed [his]_p3705 mind about letting [them]_p3706 go. But [he]_p3707 was far too proud for that.",5,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""If [you]_p3708 find [your]_p3709 mothers,"". [he]_p3710 said darkly,. ""[I]_p3711 hope [you]_p3712 will like them. The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most of [them]_p3713 began to look rather doubtful. After all, [their]_p3714 faces said, were [they]_p3715 not noodles to want to go?. ""Now then,"". cried [Peter]_n1464 ,. ""no fuss, no blubbering good-bye, [Wendy]_n1465"". and [he]_p3716 held out [his]_p3718 hand cheerily, quite as if [they]_p3719 must really go now, for [he]_p3717 had something important to do. [She]_p3720 had to take [his]_p3721 hand, and there was no indication that [he]_p3722 would prefer a thimble.",2,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[You]_p3723 will remember about changing [your]_p3724 flannels, [Peter]_n1466 ?"". [she]_p3725 said, lingering over him. [She]_p3726 was always so particular about [their]_p3727 flannels. ""Yes. ""And [you]_p3728 will take [your]_p3729 medicine?. ""Yes. That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. [Peter]_n1467 , however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. ""Are [you]_p3730 ready, [Tinker Bell]_n1468 ?"". [he]_p3731 called out.",3,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay, ay. ""Then lead the way. [Tink]_n1469 darted up the nearest tree but no one followed her, for [it]_p3732 was at this moment that the pirates made [their]_p3733 dreadful attack upon the redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. [Wendy]_n1470 fell on [her]_p3734 knees, but [her]_p3735 arms were extended toward [Peter]_n1471. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly blown in [his]_p3738 direction [they]_p3739 were beseeching [him]_p3736 mutely not to desert them. As for [Peter]_n1472 , [he]_p3740 seized [his]_p3743 sword, the same [he]_p3741 thought [he]_p3741 had slain [Barbecue]_n1473 with, and the lust of battle was in [his]_p3744 eye. Chapter 12 THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the unscrupulous [Hook]_n1474 had conducted [it]_p3745 improperly, for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.",6,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare [it]_p3746 is always the redskin who attacks, and with the wiliness of [his]_p3748 race [he]_p3749 does [it]_p3747 just before the dawn, at which time [he]_p3750 knows the courage of the whites to be at [its]_p3751 lowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for [it]_p3752 is destruction to be too far from water. There [they]_p3753 await the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching [their]_p3754 revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle, [snake-like]_n1475 , among the grass without stirring a blade. The brushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived. Not a sound is to be heard, save when [they]_p3755 give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves and some of [them]_p3756 do [it]_p3757 even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through [it]_p3759 for the first time but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching. That this was the usual procedure was so well known to [Hook]_n1476 that in disregarding [it]_p3760 [he]_p3761 cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance. The Piccaninnies, on [their]_p3762 part, trusted implicitly to [his]_p3764 honour, and [their]_p3763 whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.",2,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p3766 left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of [their]_p3767 tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair of civilised peoples, [they]_p3768 knew that the pirates were on the island from the moment one of [them]_p3769 trod on a dry stick and in an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where [Hook]_n1477 had landed [his]_p3770 forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing [their]_p3771 mocassins with the heels in front. [They]_p3772 found only one hillock with a stream at [its]_p3773 base, so that [Hook]_n1478 had no choice here [he]_p3774 must establish [himself]_p3775 and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded [their]_p3776 blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children's home, awaiting the cold moment when [they]_p3777 should deal pale death. Here dreaming, though [wide-awake]_n1479 , of the exquisite tortures to which [they]_p3778 were to put [him]_p3779 at break of day, those confiding savages were found by the treacherous [Hook]_n1480. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scouts as escaped the carnage, [he]_p3780 does not seem even to have paused at the rising ground, though [it]_p3784 is certain that in that grey light [he]_p3781 must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited [his]_p3786 subtle mind [he]_p3781 would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent on [he]_p3782 pounded with no policy but to fall to [get into combat]. What could the bewildered scouts do, masters as [they]_p3787 were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot helplessly after him, exposing [themselves]_p3789 fatally to view, while [they]_p3788 gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry. Around the brave [Tiger Lily]_n1481 were a dozen of [her]_p3790 stoutest warriors, and [they]_p3791 suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. [Fell]_n1482 from [their]_p3792 eyes then the film through which [they]_p3793 had looked at victory.",6,,27,
barrie_peter_pan," No more would [they]_p3794 torture at the stake. For [them]_p3795 the happy hunting-grounds was now. [They]_p3796 knew [it]_p3797 but as [their]_p3798 father's sons [they]_p3799 acquitted themselves. Even then [they]_p3800 had time to gather in a phalanx [dense formation] that would have been hard to break had [they]_p3801 risen quickly, but this [they]_p3801 were forbidden to do by the traditions of [their]_p3803 race. [It]_p3804 is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been to them, [they]_p3805 remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving as if the foe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, [they]_p3806 seized [their]_p3807 weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry but [it]_p3808 was now too late. [It]_p3809 is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the [Piccaninny]_n1483 tribe. Not all unavenged did [they]_p3810 die, for with [Lean Wolf]_n1484 fell [Alf Mason]_n1485 , to disturb the [Spanish Main]_n1486 no more, and among others who bit the dust were [Geo]_n1487.",5,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [Scourie]_n1488 , [Chas]_n1489. [Turley]_n1490 , and the [Alsatian Foggerty]_n1491. [Turley]_n1492 fell to the tomahawk of the terrible [Panther]_n1493 , who ultimately cut a way through the pirates with [Tiger Lily]_n1494 and a small remnant of the tribe. To what extent [Hook]_n1495 is to blame for [his]_p3811 tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide. Had [he]_p3812 waited on the rising ground till the proper hour [he]_p3813 and [his]_p3814 men would probably have been butchered and in judging [him]_p3815 [it]_p3816 is only fair to take this into account. What [he]_p3817 should perhaps have done was to acquaint [his]_p3819 opponents that [he]_p3818 proposed to follow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made [his]_p3820 strategy of no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties. [[One]_n1496 ]_p3821 cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme, and the fell [deadly] genius with which [it]_p3822 was carried out. What were [his]_p3823 own feelings about [himself]_p3826 at that triumphant moment? [Fain]_n1497 [gladly] would [his]_p3824 dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping [their]_p3827 cutlasses, [they]_p3829 gathered at a discreet distance from [his]_p3824 hook, and squinted through [their]_p3828 ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in [his]_p3830 heart, but [his]_p3831 face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, [he]_p3833 stood [aloof]_n1498 from [his]_p3831 followers in spirit as in substance.",11,,23,
barrie_peter_pan," The night's work was not yet over, for [it]_p3834 was not the redskins [he]_p3835 had come out to destroy [they]_p3837 were but the bees to be smoked, so that [he]_p3836 should get at the honey. [It]_p3838 was [Pan]_n1499 [he]_p3839 wanted, [Pan]_n1500 and [Wendy]_n1501 and [their]_p3840 band, but chi[efl]_n1502 y Pan. [Peter]_n1503 was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man's hatred of him. True [he]_p3841 had flung [Hook]_n1504 's arm to the crocodile, but even this and the increased insecurity of life to which [it]_p3842 led, owing to the crocodile's pertinacity [persistance], hardly account for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about [Peter]_n1505 which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. [It]_p3843 was not [his]_p3844 courage, [it]_p3846 was not [his]_p3845 engaging appearance, [it]_p3847 was not,. There is no beating about the bush, for [we]_p3848 know quite well what [it]_p3849 was, and have got to tell. [It]_p3850 was [Peter]_n1506 's cockiness. This had got on [Hook]_n1507 's nerves [it]_p3851 made [his]_p3853 iron claw twitch, and at night [it]_p3852 disturbed [him]_p3854 like an insect. While [Peter]_n1508 lived, the tortured man felt that [he]_p3855 was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.",10,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get [his]_p3856 dogs down? [He]_p3858 ran [his]_p3857 greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones. [They]_p3859 wriggled uncomfortably, for [they]_p3860 knew [he]_p3861 would not scruple [hesitate] to ram [them]_p3862 down with poles. In the meantime, what of the boys? [We]_p3863 have seen [them]_p3864 at the first clang of the weapons, turned as [it]_p3866 were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing with outstretched arms to [Peter]_n1509 and [we]_p3867 return to [them]_p3865 as [their]_p3868 mouths close, and [their]_p3869 arms fall to [their]_p3869 sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as [it]_p3871 arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind but [they]_p3873 know that in the passing [it]_p3872 has determined [their]_p3874 fate. Which side had won? The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the question put by every boy, and alas, [they]_p3875 also heard [Peter]_n1510 's answer. ""If the redskins have won,"". [he]_p3876 said,. ""[they]_p3877 will beat the [tom-tom]_n1511 [it]_p3878 is always [their]_p3879 sign of victory. Now [Smee]_n1512 had found the [tom-tom]_n1513 , and was at that moment sitting on it. ""[You]_p3880 will never hear the [tom-tom]_n1514 again,"".",6,,25,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p3881 muttered, but inaudibly of course, for strict silence had been enjoined [urged]. To [his]_p3882 amazement [Hook]_n1515 signed [him]_p3883 to beat the [tom-tom]_n1516 , and slowly there came to [Smee]_n1517 an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. [Never]_n1518 , probably, had this simple man admired [Hook]_n1519 so much. Twice [Smee]_n1520 beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully. ""The [tom-tom]_n1521 ,"". the miscreants heard [Peter]_n1522 cry. ""an Indian victory! The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above, and almost immediately [they]_p3884 repeated [their]_p3885 good-byes to [Peter]_n1523. This puzzled the pirates, but all [their]_p3886 other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. [They]_p3887 smirked at each other and rubbed [their]_p3888 hands. Rapidly and silently [Hook]_n1524 gave [his]_p3889 orders: one man to each tree, and the others to arrange [themselves]_p3890 in a line two yards apart.",10,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," Chapter 13 DO [YOU]_p3891 BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?  The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to emerge from [his]_p3892 tree was [Curly]_n1525. [He]_p3893 rose out of [it]_p3894 into the arms of [Cecco]_n1526 , who flung [him]_p3895 to [Smee]_n1527 , who flung [him]_p3896 to [Starkey]_n1528 , who flung [him]_p3896 to [Bill Jukes]_n1529 , who flung [him]_p3897 to [Noodler]_n1530 , and so [he]_p3899 was tossed from one to another till [he]_p3900 fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys were plucked from [their]_p3901 trees in this ruthless manner and several of [them]_p3902 were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to hand. A different treatment was accorded to [Wendy]_n1531 , who came last. With ironical politeness [Hook]_n1532 raised [his]_p3903 hat to her, and, offering [her]_p3905 [his]_p3904 arm, escorted [her]_p3906 to the spot where the others were being gagged. [He]_p3908 did [it]_p3909 with such an air, [he]_p3910 was so frightfully [DISTINGUE]_n1533 [imposingly distinguished], that [she]_p3911 was too fascinated to cry out. [She]_p3912 was only a little girl. Perhaps [it]_p3913 is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment [Hook]_n1534 entranced her, and [we]_p3917 tell on [her]_p3914 only because [her]_p3915 slip led to strange results. Had [she]_p3918 haughtily unhanded [him]_p3920 (and [we]_p3921 should have loved to write [it]_p3922 of her), [she]_p3919 would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then [Hook]_n1535 would probably not have been present at the tying of the children and had [he]_p3923 not been at the tying [he]_p3924 would not have discovered [Slightly]_n1536 's secret, and without the secret [he]_p3924 could not presently have made [his]_p3926 foul attempt on [Peter]_n1537 's life.",13,,34,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p3927 were tied to prevent [their]_p3928 flying away, doubled up with [their]_p3929 knees close to [their]_p3929 ears and for the trussing of [them]_p3931 the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until [Slightly]_n1538 's turn came, when [he]_p3932 was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags [ends] with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked [him]_p3933 in [their]_p3934 rage, just as [you]_p3936 kick the parcel (though in fairness [you]_p3937 should kick the string) and strange to say [it]_p3938 was [Hook]_n1539 who told [them]_p3939 to belay [their]_p3935 violence. [His]_p3940 lip was curled with malicious triumph. While [his]_p3941 dogs were merely sweating because every time [they]_p3943 tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part [he]_p3944 bulged out in another, [Hook]_n1540 's master mind had gone far beneath [Slightly]_n1541 's surface, probing not for effects but for causes and [his]_p3942 exultation showed that [he]_p3945 had found them. [Slightly]_n1542 , white to the gills, knew that [Hook]_n1543 had surprised [discovered] [his]_p3946 secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick. [Poor]_n1544 [Slightly]_n1545 , most wretched of all the children now, for [he]_p3947 was in a panic about [Peter]_n1546 , bitterly regretted what [he]_p3948 had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when [he]_p3949 was hot, [he]_p3950 had swelled in consequence to [his]_p3952 present girth, and instead of reducing [himself]_p3955 to fit [his]_p3953 tree [he]_p3950 had, unknown to the others, whittled [his]_p3953 tree to make [it]_p3956 fit him. Sufficient of this [Hook]_n1547 guessed to persuade [him]_p3957 that [Peter]_n1548 at last lay at [his]_p3958 mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean caverns of [his]_p3959 mind crossed [his]_p3959 lips [he]_p3961 merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that [he]_p3962 would be alone. How to convey them? Hunched up in [their]_p3963 ropes [they]_p3964 might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass.",11,,38,
barrie_peter_pan," Again [Hook]_n1549 's genius surmounted difficulties. [He]_p3965 indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised [it]_p3966 on [their]_p3968 shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood. [I]_p3969 don't know whether any of the children were crying if so, the singing drowned the sound but as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from [its]_p3970 chimney as if defying [Hook]_n1550. [Hook]_n1551 saw it, and [it]_p3971 did [Peter]_n1552 a bad service. [It]_p3973 dried up any trickle of pity for [him]_p3974 that may have remained in the pirate's infuriated breast. The first thing [he]_p3975 did on finding [himself]_p3976 alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to [Slightly]_n1553 's tree, and make sure that [it]_p3977 provided [him]_p3978 with a passage. Then for long [he]_p3979 remained brooding [his]_p3980 hat of ill omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through [his]_p3981 hair. [Dark]_n1554 as were [his]_p3982 thoughts [his]_p3983 blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently [he]_p3984 listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent below as above the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void.",6,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," Was that boy [asleep]_n1555 , or did [he]_p3985 stand waiting at the foot of [Slightly]_n1556 's tree, with [his]_p3986 dagger in [his]_p3987 hand? There was no way of knowing, save by going down. [Hook]_n1557 let [his]_p3988 cloak slip softly to the ground, and then biting [his]_p3989 lips till a lewd blood stood on them, [he]_p3990 stepped into the tree. [He]_p3991 was a brave man, but for a moment [he]_p3992 had to stop there and wipe [his]_p3993 brow, which was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, [he]_p3994 let [himself]_p3995 go into the unknown. [He]_p3996 arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting at [his]_p3997 breath, which had almost left him. As [his]_p3998 eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape but the only one on which [his]_p3999 greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay [Peter]_n1558 fast [asleep]_n1559. [Unaware]_n1560 of the tragedy being enacted above, [Peter]_n1561 had continued, for a little time after the children left, to play gaily on [his]_p4000 pipes: no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to [himself]_p4001 that [he]_p4002 did not care. Then [he]_p4003 decided not to take [his]_p4004 medicine, so as to grieve [Wendy]_n1562. Then [he]_p4005 lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex [her]_p4006 still more for [she]_p4007 had always tucked [them]_p4008 inside it, because [you]_p4009 never know that [you]_p4010 may not grow chilly at the turn of the night.",8,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," Then [he]_p4011 nearly cried but [it]_p4014 struck [him]_p4016 how indignant [she]_p4017 would be if [he]_p4012 laughed instead so [he]_p4012 laughed a haughty laugh and fell [asleep]_n1563 in the middle of it. Sometimes, though not often, [he]_p4018 had dreams, and [they]_p4019 were more painful than the dreams of other boys. For hours [he]_p4020 could not be separated from these dreams, though [he]_p4021 wailed piteously in them. [They]_p4022 had to do, [I]_p4023 think, with the riddle of [his]_p4024 existence. At such times [it]_p4025 had been [Wendy]_n1564 's custom to take [him]_p4026 out of bed and sit with [him]_p4027 on [her]_p4031 lap, soothing [him]_p4027 in dear ways of [her]_p4032 own invention, and when [he]_p4033 grew calmer to put [him]_p4028 back to bed before [he]_p4034 quite woke up, so that [he]_p4034 should not know of the indignity to which [she]_p4036 had subjected him. But on this occasion [he]_p4037 had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. [One]_n1565 arm dropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of [his]_p4038 laugh was stranded on [his]_p4039 mouth, which was open, showing the little pearls. Thus defenceless [Hook]_n1566 found him. [He]_p4040 stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at [his]_p4041 enemy. Did no feeling of compassion disturb [his]_p4042 sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil [he]_p4043 loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was [himself]_p4045 no mean performer on the harpsichord) and, let [it]_p4046 be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred [him]_p4047 profoundly.",4,,34,
barrie_peter_pan," Mastered by [his]_p4048 better self [he]_p4049 would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing. What stayed [him]_p4050 was [Peter]_n1567 's impertinent appearance as [he]_p4051 slept. The open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: [they]_p4052 were such a personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to [their]_p4053 offensiveness. [They]_p4054 steeled [Hook]_n1568 's heart. If [his]_p4055 rage had broken [him]_p4056 into a hundred pieces every one of [them]_p4057 would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper. Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, [Hook]_n1569 stood in darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward [he]_p4058 discovered an obstacle, the door of [Slightly]_n1570 's tree. [It]_p4059 did not entirely fill the aperture, and [he]_p4060 had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, [he]_p4061 found to [his]_p4062 fury that [it]_p4064 was low down, beyond [his]_p4063 reach. To [his]_p4065 disordered brain [it]_p4066 seemed then that the irritating quality in [Peter]_n1571 's face and figure visibly increased, and [he]_p4068 rattled the door and flung [himself]_p4069 against it. Was [his]_p4070 enemy to escape [him]_p4072 after all? But what was that? The red in [his]_p4071 eye had caught sight of [Peter]_n1572 's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach.",6,,24,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p4073 fathomed what [it]_p4074 was straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in [his]_p4075 power. Lest [he]_p4076 should be taken alive, [Hook]_n1573 always carried about [his]_p4077 person a dreadful drug, blended by [himself]_p4079 of all the death-dealing rings that had come into [his]_p4078 possession. These [he]_p4080 had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence. Five drops of this [he]_p4081 now added to [Peter]_n1574 's cup. [His]_p4082 hand shook, but [it]_p4083 was in exultation rather than in shame. As [he]_p4084 did [it]_p4086 [he]_p4085 avoided glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve [him]_p4087 merely to avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look [he]_p4088 cast upon [his]_p4089 victim, and turning, wormed [his]_p4090 way with difficulty up the tree. As [he]_p4091 emerged at the top [he]_p4092 looked the very spirit of evil breaking from [its]_p4093 hole. Donning [his]_p4094 hat at [its]_p4097 most rakish angle, [he]_p4098 wound [his]_p4095 cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal [his]_p4095 person from the night, of which [it]_p4099 was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself, stole away through the trees. [Peter]_n1575 slept on.",3,,27,
barrie_peter_pan," The light guttered [burned to edges] and went out, leaving the tenement in darkness but still [he]_p4100 slept. [It]_p4101 must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when [he]_p4102 suddenly sat up in [his]_p4104 bed, wakened by [he]_p4103 knew not what. [It]_p4105 was a soft cautious tapping on the door of [his]_p4106 tree. Soft and cautious, but in that stillness [it]_p4107 was sinister. [Peter]_n1576 felt for [his]_p4108 dagger till [his]_p4109 hand gripped it. Then [he]_p4110 spoke. ""Who is that?   For long there was no answer: then again the knock. ""Who are you?   No answer. [He]_p4111 was thrilled, and [he]_p4112 loved being thrilled. In two strides [he]_p4113 reached the door.",1,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," Unlike [Slightly]_n1577 's door, [it]_p4114 filled the aperture [opening], so that [he]_p4116 could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him. ""[I]_p4117 won't open unless [you]_p4118 speak,"". [Peter]_n1578 cried. Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice. ""Let [me]_p4119 in, [Peter]_n1579. [It]_p4120 was [Tink]_n1580 , and quickly [he]_p4121 unbarred to her. [She]_p4122 flew in excitedly, [her]_p4123 face flushed and [her]_p4124 dress stained with mud. ""What is it?. ""Oh, [you]_p4125 could never guess!"". [she]_p4126 cried, and offered [him]_p4127 three guesses.",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Out with it!"". [he]_p4128 shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers [magicians] pull from [their]_p4129 mouths, [she]_p4130 told of the capture of [Wendy]_n1581 and the boys. [Peter]_n1582 's heart bobbed up and down as [he]_p4131 listened. [Wendy]_n1583 bound, and on the pirate ship [she]_p4132 who loved everything to be just so!. ""I'll rescue her!"". [he]_p4133 cried, leaping at [his]_p4134 weapons. As [he]_p4135 leapt [he]_p4136 thought of something [he]_p4136 could do to please her. [He]_p4138 could take [his]_p4139 medicine. [His]_p4140 hand closed on the fatal draught. ""No!"".",3,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," shrieked [Tinker Bell]_n1584 , who had heard [Hook]_n1585 mutter about [his]_p4141 deed as [he]_p4142 sped through the forest. ""Why not?. ""[It]_p4143 is poisoned. ""Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?. ""[Hook]_n1586. ""Don't be silly. How could [Hook]_n1587 have got down here? Alas, [Tinker Bell]_n1588 could not explain this, for even [she]_p4144 did not know the dark secret of Slightly's tree. Nevertheless [Hook]_n1589 's words had left no room for doubt. The cup was poisoned. ""Besides,"".",6,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Peter]_n1590 , quite believing himself,. ""[I]_p4145 never fell [asleep]_n1591. [He]_p4146 raised the cup. No time for words now time for deeds and with one of [her]_p4147 lightning movements [Tink]_n1592 got between [his]_p4148 lips and the draught, and drained [it]_p4149 to the dregs. ""Why, [Tink]_n1593 , how dare [you]_p4150 drink [my]_p4151 medicine? But [she]_p4152 did not answer. Already [she]_p4153 was reeling in the air. ""What is the matter with you?"". cried [Peter]_n1594 , suddenly afraid. ""[It]_p4154 was poisoned, [Peter]_n1595 ,"". [she]_p4155 told [him]_p4156 softly.",6,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""and now [I]_p4157 am going to be dead. ""[O Tink]_n1596 , did [you]_p4158 drink [it]_p4159 to save me?. ""Yes. ""But why, [Tink]_n1597 ? [Her]_p4160 wings would scarcely carry [her]_p4161 now, but in reply [she]_p4162 alighted on [his]_p4163 shoulder and gave [his]_p4164 nose a loving bite. [She]_p4165 whispered in [his]_p4166 ear. ""[You]_p4167 silly ass,"". and then, tottering to [her]_p4168 chamber, lay down on the bed. [His]_p4169 head almost filled the fourth wall of [her]_p4170 little room as [he]_p4172 knelt near [her]_p4171 in distress. Every moment [her]_p4173 light was growing fainter and [he]_p4174 knew that if [it]_p4175 went out [she]_p4176 would be no more. [She]_p4177 liked [his]_p4178 tears so much that [she]_p4179 put out [her]_p4180 beautiful finger and let [them]_p4181 run over it.",2,,25,
barrie_peter_pan," [Her]_p4182 voice was so low that at first [he]_p4183 could not make out what [she]_p4184 said. Then [he]_p4185 made [it]_p4186 out. [She]_p4187 was saying that [she]_p4188 thought [she]_p4189 could get well again if children believed in fairies. [Peter]_n1598 flung out [his]_p4190 arms. There were no children there, and [it]_p4191 was night time but [he]_p4192 addressed all who might be dreaming of the [Neverland]_n1599 , and who were therefore nearer to [him]_p4193 than [you]_p4194 think: boys and girls in [their]_p4195 nighties, and naked papooses in [their]_p4196 baskets hung from trees. ""Do [you]_p4197 believe?"". [he]_p4198 cried. [Tink]_n1600 sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to [her]_p4199 fate. [She]_p4200 fancied [she]_p4201 heard answers in the affirmative, and then again [she]_p4202 wasn't sure. ""What do [you]_p4203 think?"".",3,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p4204 asked [Peter]_n1601. ""If [you]_p4205 believe,"". [he]_p4206 shouted to them,. ""clap [your]_p4207 hands don't let [Tink]_n1602 die. Many clapped. Some didn't. A few beasts hissed. The clapping stopped suddenly as if countless mothers had rushed to [their]_p4208 nurseries to see what on earth was happening but already [Tink]_n1603 was saved. First [her]_p4209 voice grew strong, then [she]_p4210 popped out of bed, then [she]_p4211 was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever. [She]_p4212 never thought of thanking those who believed, but [she]_p4213 would have liked to get at the ones who had hissed.",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""And now to rescue [Wendy]_n1604 ! The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when [Peter]_n1605 rose from [his]_p4214 tree, begirt [belted] with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon [his]_p4215 perilous quest. [It]_p4216 was not such a night as [he]_p4217 would have chosen. [He]_p4218 had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape [his]_p4219 eyes but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing [his]_p4220 shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that [he]_p4221 was [astir]_n1606. [He]_p4222 regretted now that [he]_p4223 had given the birds of the island such strange names that [they]_p4224 are very wild and difficult of approach. There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which happily [he]_p4225 was an adept [expert]. But in what direction, for [he]_p4226 could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a space [Nature]_n1607 stood still in horror of the recent carnage. [He]_p4227 had taught the children something of the forest lore that [he]_p4228 had [himself]_p4229 learned from [Tiger Lily]_n1608 and [Tinker Bell]_n1609 , and knew that in [their]_p4230 dire hour [they]_p4231 were not likely to forget it. [Slightly]_n1610 , if [he]_p4232 had an opportunity, would blaze [cut a mark in] the trees, for instance, [Curly]_n1611 would drop seeds, and [Wendy]_n1612 would leave [her]_p4233 handkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and [he]_p4234 could not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.",9,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not a movement and yet [he]_p4237 knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, or stalking [him]_p4235 from behind. [He]_p4238 swore this terrible oath:. ""[Hook]_n1613 or [me]_p4239 this time. Now [he]_p4240 crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, [he]_p4241 darted across a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on [his]_p4242 lip and [his]_p4243 dagger at the ready. [He]_p4244 was frightfully happy. Chapter 14 THE [PIRATE]_n1614 SHIP [One]_n1615 green light squinting over [Kidd]_n1616 's [Creek]_n1617 , which is near the mouth of the pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY [ROGER]_n1618 , lay, low in the water a rakish-looking [speedy-looking] craft foul to the hull, every beam in [her]_p4245 detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. [She]_p4246 was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for [she]_p4247 floated immune in the horror of [her]_p4248 name. [She]_p4249 was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from [her]_p4250 could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable save the whir of the ship's sewing machine at which [Smee]_n1619 sat, ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic [Smee]_n1620. [I]_p4251 know not why [he]_p4252 was so infinitely pathetic, unless [it]_p4255 were because [he]_p4253 was so pathetically unaware of [it]_p4256 but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings [he]_p4253 had touched the fount of [Hook]_n1621 's tears and made [it]_p4256 flow.",9,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," Of this, as of almost everything else, [Smee]_n1622 was quite unconscious. A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma [putrid mist] of the night others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where even in [their]_p4258 sleep [they]_p4259 rolled skillfully to this side or that out of [Hook]_n1623 's reach, lest [he]_p4260 should claw [them]_p4261 mechanically in passing. [Hook]_n1624 trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. [It]_p4262 was [his]_p4263 hour of triumph. [Peter]_n1625 had been removed for ever from [his]_p4264 path, and all the other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. [It]_p4265 was [his]_p4266 grimmest deed since the days when [he]_p4270 had brought [Barbecue]_n1626 to heel and knowing as [we]_p4272 do how vain a tabernacle is man, could [we]_p4273 be surprised had [he]_p4271 now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of [his]_p4267 success? But there was no elation in [his]_p4267 gait, which kept pace with the action of [his]_p4268 sombre mind. [Hook]_n1627 was profoundly dejected. [He]_p4274 was often thus when communing with [himself]_p4275 on board ship in the quietude of the night. [It]_p4276 was because [he]_p4277 was so terribly alone.",6,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by [his]_p4278 dogs. [They]_p4279 were socially inferior to him. [Hook]_n1628 was not [his]_p4280 true name. To reveal who [he]_p4281 really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed, [he]_p4282 had been at a famous public school  and [its]_p4283 traditions still clung to [him]_p4284 like garments, with which indeed [they]_p4285 are largely concerned. Thus [it]_p4286 was offensive to [him]_p4287 even now to board a ship in the same dress in which [he]_p4288 grappled [attacked] her, and [he]_p4289 still adhered in [his]_p4290 walk to the school's distinguished slouch. But above all [he]_p4291 retained the passion for good form. Good form! However much [he]_p4292 may have degenerated, [he]_p4293 still knew that this is all that really matters. From far within [him]_p4294 [he]_p4295 heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through [them]_p4296 came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when [one]_p4297 cannot sleep. ""Have [you]_p4298 been good form [to-day]_n1629 ?"". was [their]_p4299 eternal question.",2,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, [it]_p4300 is mine,"". [he]_p4301 cried. ""Is [it]_p4302 quite good form to be distinguished at anything?"". the tap-tap from [his]_p4303 school replied. ""[I]_p4304 am the only man whom [Barbecue]_n1630 feared,"". [he]_p4305 urged,. ""and [Flint]_n1631 feared [Barbecue]_n1632. ""[Barbecue]_n1633 , [Flint]_n1634 , what house?"". came the cutting retort. Most disquieting reflection of all, was [it]_p4306 not bad form to think about good form?  [His]_p4307 vitals were tortured by this problem.",5,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p4308 was a claw within [him]_p4309 sharper than the iron one and as [it]_p4311 tore him, the perspiration dripped down [his]_p4312 tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked [his]_p4313 doublet. Ofttimes [he]_p4314 drew [his]_p4315 sleeve across [his]_p4316 face, but there was no damming that trickle. Ah, envy not [Hook]_n1635. There came to [him]_p4317 a presentiment of [his]_p4318 early dissolution [death]. [It]_p4319 was as if [Peter]_n1636 's terrible oath had boarded the ship. [Hook]_n1637 felt a gloomy desire to make [his]_p4320 dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for it. ""Better for [Hook]_n1638 ,"". [he]_p4321 cried,. ""if [he]_p4322 had had less ambition!"". [It]_p4323 was in [his]_p4324 darkest hours only that [he]_p4325 referred to [himself]_p4326 in the third person.",4,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No little children to love me!   Strange that [he]_p4327 should think of this, which had never troubled [him]_p4328 before perhaps the sewing machine brought [it]_p4329 to [his]_p4330 mind. For long [he]_p4331 muttered to himself, staring at [Smee]_n1639 , who was hemming placidly, under the conviction that all children feared him. Feared him! Feared [Smee]_n1640 ! There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him. [He]_p4332 had said horrid things to [them]_p4333 and hit [them]_p4334 with the palm of [his]_p4335 hand, because [he]_p4337 could not hit with [his]_p4336 fist, but [they]_p4338 had only clung to [him]_p4339 the more. [Michael]_n1641 had tried on [his]_p4340 spectacles. To tell poor [Smee]_n1642 that [they]_p4341 thought [him]_p4342 lovable! [Hook]_n1643 itched to do it, but [it]_p4343 seemed too brutal. Instead, [he]_p4345 revolved this mystery in [his]_p4347 mind: why do [they]_p4348 find [Smee]_n1644 lovable? [He]_p4349 pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that [he]_p4346 was. If [Smee]_n1645 was lovable, what was [it]_p4350 that made [him]_p4351 so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself,. ""Good form? Had the bo'sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of all? [He]_p4354 remembered that [you]_p4355 have to prove [you]_p4356 don't know [you]_p4356 have [it]_p4352 before [you]_p4357 are eligible for [Pop]_n1646 [an elite social club at [Eton]_n1647 ]. With a cry of rage [he]_p4359 raised [his]_p4361 iron hand over [Smee]_n1648 's head but [he]_p4360 did not tear.",10,,33,
barrie_peter_pan," What arrested [him]_p4362 was this reflection:. ""To claw a man because [he]_p4363 is good form, what would that be?. ""Bad form! The unhappy [Hook]_n1649 was as impotent [powerless] as [he]_p4364 was damp, and [he]_p4365 fell forward like a cut flower. [His]_p4366 dogs thinking [him]_p4367 out of the way for a time, discipline instantly relaxed and [they]_p4370 broke into a bacchanalian [drunken] dance, which brought [him]_p4368 to [his]_p4371 feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of water had passed over him. ""[Quiet]_n1650 , [you]_p4372 scugs,"". [he]_p4373 cried,. ""or I'll cast anchor in [you]_p4374 "". and at once the din was hushed. ""Are all the children chained, so that [they]_p4375 cannot fly away?. ""Ay, ay.",2,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Then hoist [them]_p4376 up. The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except [Wendy]_n1651 , and ranged in line in front of him. For a time [he]_p4377 seemed unconscious of [their]_p4378 presence. [He]_p4379 lolled at [his]_p4380 ease, humming, not unmelodiously, snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon the light from [his]_p4381 cigar gave a touch of colour to [his]_p4382 face. ""Now then, bullies,"". [he]_p4383 said briskly,. ""six of [you]_p4384 walk the plank [to-night]_n1652 , but [I]_p4385 have room for two cabin boys. Which of [you]_p4386 is [it]_p4387 to be?. ""Don't irritate [him]_p4388 unnecessarily,"".",2,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," had been [Wendy]_n1653 's instructions in the hold so [Tootles]_n1654 stepped forward politely. [Tootles]_n1655 hated the idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told [him]_p4389 that [it]_p4390 would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person and though a somewhat silly boy, [he]_p4391 knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise [them]_p4392 for it, but make constant use of it. So [Tootles]_n1656 explained prudently,. ""[You]_p4393 see, sir, [I]_p4394 don't think [my]_p4395 mother would like [me]_p4396 to be a pirate. Would [your]_p4397 mother like [you]_p4398 to be a pirate, [Slightly]_n1657 ? [He]_p4399 winked at [Slightly]_n1658 , who said mournfully,. ""[I]_p4400 don't think so,"". as if [he]_p4401 wished things had been otherwise. ""Would [your]_p4402 mother like [you]_p4403 to be a pirate, [Twin]_n1659 ?. ""[I]_p4404 don't think so,"".",7,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," said the first twin, as clever as the others. ""[Nibs]_n1660 , would,. ""Stow this gab,"". roared [Hook]_n1661 , and the spokesmen were dragged back. ""You, boy,"". [he]_p4405 said, addressing [John]_n1662 ,. ""[you]_p4406 look as if [you]_p4407 had a little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, [my]_p4409 hearty? Now [John]_n1663 had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep. and [he]_p4410 was struck by [Hook]_n1664 's picking [him]_p4411 out.",5,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p4412 once thought of calling [myself]_p4413 [Red-handed Jack]_n1665 ,"". [he]_p4414 said diffidently. ""And a good name too. We'll call [you]_p4415 that here, bully, if [you]_p4416 join. ""What do [you]_p4417 think, [Michael]_n1666 ?"". asked [John]_n1667. ""What would [you]_p4418 call [me]_p4419 if [I]_p4420 join?"". [Michael]_n1668 demanded. ""[Blackbeard Joe]_n1669. [Michael]_n1670 was naturally impressed.",6,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""What do [you]_p4421 think, [John]_n1671 ?"". [He]_p4422 wanted [John]_n1672 to decide, and [John]_n1673 wanted [him]_p4423 to decide. ""[Shall]_n1674 [we]_p4424 still be respectful subjects of the [King]_n1675 ?"". [John]_n1676 inquired. Through [Hook]_n1677 's teeth came the answer:. ""[You]_p4425 would have to swear, Down with the [King]_n1678. ' Perhaps [John]_n1679 had not behaved very well so far, but [he]_p4426 shone out now. ""Then [I]_p4427 refuse,"". [he]_p4428 cried, banging the barrel in front of [Hook]_n1680. ""And [I]_p4429 refuse,"".",10,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," cried [Michael]_n1681. ""[Rule Britannia]_n1682 !"". squeaked [Curly]_n1683. The infuriated pirates buffeted [them]_p4430 in the mouth and [Hook]_n1684 roared out,. ""That seals [your]_p4431 doom. [Bring]_n1685 up [their]_p4432 mother. Get the plank ready. [They]_p4433 were only boys, and [they]_p4434 went white as [they]_p4435 saw [Jukes]_n1686 and [Cecco]_n1687 preparing the fatal plank. But [they]_p4436 tried to look brave when [Wendy]_n1688 was brought up. No words of [mine]_p4437 can tell [you]_p4438 how [Wendy]_n1689 despised those pirates.",9,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling but all that [she]_p4439 saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which [you]_p4440 might not have written with [your]_p4441 finger. ""Dirty pig"". and [she]_p4442 had already written [it]_p4443 on several. But as the boys gathered round [her]_p4444 [she]_p4445 had no thought, of course, save for them. ""So, [my]_p4446 beauty,"". said [Hook]_n1690 , as if [he]_p4447 spoke in syrup,. ""[you]_p4448 are to see [your]_p4449 children walk the plank. Fine gentlemen though [he]_p4450 was, the intensity of [his]_p4452 communings had soiled [his]_p4453 ruff, and suddenly [he]_p4451 knew that [she]_p4454 was gazing at it. With a hasty gesture [he]_p4455 tried to hide it, but [he]_p4456 was too late.",1,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Are [they]_p4457 to die?"". asked [Wendy]_n1691 , with a look of such frightful contempt that [he]_p4458 nearly fainted. ""[They]_p4459 are,"". [he]_p4460 snarled. ""Silence all,"". [he]_p4461 called gloatingly,. ""for a mother's last words to [her]_p4462 children. At this moment [Wendy]_n1692 was grand. ""These are [my]_p4463 last words, dear boys,  [she]_p4464 said firmly. ""[I]_p4465 feel that [I]_p4466 have a message to [you]_p4467 from [your]_p4468 real mothers, and [it]_p4469 is this: [We]_p4470 hope [our]_p4471 sons will die like [English]_n1693 gentlemen.",3,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," ' Even the pirates were awed, and [Tootles]_n1694 cried out hysterically,. ""[I]_p4472 am going to do what [my]_p4473 mother hopes. What are [you]_p4474 to do, [Nibs]_n1695 ?. ""What [my]_p4475 mother hopes. What are [you]_p4476 to do, [Twin]_n1696 ?. ""What [my]_p4477 mother hopes. [John]_n1697 , what are, But [Hook]_n1698 had found [his]_p4478 voice again. ""Tie [her]_p4479 up!"". [he]_p4480 shouted. [It]_p4481 was [Smee]_n1699 who tied [her]_p4482 to the mast.",6,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," ""See here, honey,"". [he]_p4483 whispered,. ""I'll save [you]_p4484 if [you]_p4485 promise to be [my]_p4486 mother. But not even for [Smee]_n1700 would [she]_p4487 make such a promise. ""[I]_p4488 would almost rather have no children at all,"". [she]_p4489 said disdainfully [scornfully]. [It]_p4490 is sad to know that not a boy was looking at [her]_p4491 as [Smee]_n1701 tied [her]_p4492 to the mast the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk [they]_p4493 were about to take. [They]_p4494 were no longer able to hope that [they]_p4495 would walk [it]_p4497 manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from [them]_p4498 [they]_p4496 could stare and shiver only. [Hook]_n1702 smiled on [them]_p4499 with [his]_p4500 teeth closed, and took a step toward [Wendy]_n1703. [His]_p4501 intention was to turn [her]_p4502 face so that [she]_p4503 should see the boys walking the plank one by one.",4,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," But [he]_p4504 never reached her, [he]_p4505 never heard the cry of anguish [he]_p4505 hoped to wring from her. [He]_p4507 heard something else instead. [It]_p4508 was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile. [They]_p4509 all heard it, pirates, boys, [Wendy]_n1704 and immediately every head was blown in one direction not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but toward [Hook]_n1705. All knew that what was about to happen concerned [him]_p4510 alone, and that from being actors [they]_p4511 were suddenly become spectators. Very frightful was [it]_p4512 to see the change that came over him. [It]_p4513 was as if [he]_p4514 had been clipped at every joint. [He]_p4515 fell in a little heap. The sound came steadily nearer and in advance of [it]_p4516 came this ghastly thought,. ""The crocodile is about to board the ship!   Even the iron claw hung inactive as if knowing that [it]_p4517 was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted.",2,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," Left so fearfully alone, any other man would have lain with [his]_p4518 eyes shut where [he]_p4519 fell: but the gigantic brain of [Hook]_n1706 was still working, and under [its]_p4522 guidance [he]_p4520 crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as [he]_p4520 could go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and [it]_p4523 was only when [he]_p4524 brought up against the bulwarks that [he]_p4525 spoke. ""[Hide]_n1707 me!"". [he]_p4526 cried hoarsely. [They]_p4527 gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard. [They]_p4528 had no thought of fighting it. [It]_p4529 was Fate. Only when [Hook]_n1708 was hidden from [them]_p4530 did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that [they]_p4531 could rush to the ship's side to see the crocodile climbing it. Then [they]_p4532 got the strangest surprise of the [Night]_n1709 of Nights for [it]_p4533 was no crocodile that was coming to [their]_p4534 aid. [It]_p4535 was [Peter]_n1710.",5,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p4536 signed to [them]_p4537 not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion. Then [he]_p4538 went on ticking. Chapter 15. ""HOOK OR [ME]_p4539 THIS TIME [Odd]_n1711 things happen to all of [us]_p4540 on [our]_p4541 way through life without [our]_p4542 noticing for a time that [they]_p4543 have happened. Thus, to take an instance, [we]_p4544 suddenly discover that [we]_p4545 have been deaf in one ear for [we]_p4545 don't know how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come that night to [Peter]_n1712. When last [we]_p4547 saw [him]_p4548 [he]_p4549 was stealing across the island with one finger to [his]_p4550 lips and [his]_p4551 dagger at the ready. [He]_p4552 had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by and by [he]_p4555 remembered that [it]_p4553 had not been ticking. At first [he]_p4556 thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down. Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of [its]_p4557 closest companion, [Peter]_n1713 began to consider how [he]_p4558 could turn the catastrophe to [his]_p4561 own use and [he]_p4559 decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe [he]_p4559 was the crocodile and let [him]_p4562 pass unmolested.",3,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p4563 ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound, and [it]_p4564 followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what [it]_p4565 had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that [it]_p4565 was again ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a fixed idea, [it]_p4566 was a stupid beast. [Peter]_n1714 reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, [his]_p4568 legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that [they]_p4569 had entered a new element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom [I]_p4570 know. As [he]_p4571 swam [he]_p4572 had but one thought:. ""[Hook]_n1715 or [me]_p4573 this time. "". [He]_p4574 had ticked so long that [he]_p4575 now went on ticking without knowing that [he]_p4576 was doing it. Had [he]_p4577 known [he]_p4578 would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him. On the contrary, [he]_p4579 thought [he]_p4580 had scaled [her]_p4583 side as noiseless as a mouse and [he]_p4580 was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with [Hook]_n1716 in [their]_p4584 midst as abject as if [he]_p4581 had heard the crocodile.",3,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," The crocodile! No sooner did [Peter]_n1717 remember [it]_p4585 than [he]_p4586 heard the ticking. At first [he]_p4587 thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and [he]_p4588 looked behind [him]_p4589 swiftly. Then [he]_p4590 realised that [he]_p4591 was doing [it]_p4593 himself, and in a flash [he]_p4591 understood the situation. ""How clever of me!  [he]_p4594 thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause. [It]_p4595 was at this moment that [Ed Teynte]_n1718 the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by [your]_p4596 watch. [Peter]_n1719 struck true and deep. [John]_n1720 clapped [his]_p4597 hands on the ill-fated pirate's mouth to stifle the dying groan. [He]_p4598 fell forward. Four boys caught [him]_p4599 to prevent the thud.",4,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n1721 gave the signal, and the carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How long has [it]_p4600 taken?. ""[One]_n1722 !"". ([Slightly]_n1723 had begun to count. ) None too soon, [Peter]_n1724 , every inch of [him]_p4601 on tiptoe, vanished into the cabin for more than one pirate was screwing up [his]_p4602 courage to look round. [They]_p4603 could hear each other's distressed breathing now, which showed [them]_p4604 that the more terrible sound had passed. ""It's gone, captain,"". [Smee]_n1725 said, wiping off [his]_p4605 spectacles. ""All's still again.",5,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," Slowly [Hook]_n1726 let [his]_p4606 head emerge from [his]_p4607 ruff, and listened so intently that [he]_p4608 could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound, and [he]_p4609 drew [himself]_p4610 up firmly to [his]_p4611 full height. ""Then here's to [Johnny Plank]_n1727 !"". [he]_p4612 cried brazenly, hating the boys more than ever because [they]_p4613 had seen [him]_p4614 unbend. [He]_p4615 broke into the villainous ditty:. ""Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank, [You]_p4616 walks along [it]_p4617 so, Till [it]_p4618 goes down and [you]_p4619 goes down To [Davy Jones]_n1728 below! To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of dignity, [he]_p4620 danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at [them]_p4624 as [he]_p4621 sang and when [he]_p4621 finished [he]_p4622 cried,. ""Do [you]_p4625 want a touch of the cat [o' nine tails] before [you]_p4626 walk the plank?   At that [they]_p4627 fell on [their]_p4628 knees. ""No, no!"". [they]_p4629 cried so piteously that every pirate smiled. ""Fetch the cat, [Jukes]_n1729 ,"".",4,,24,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Hook]_n1730. ""it's in the cabin. The cabin! [Peter]_n1731 was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other. ""Ay, ay,"". said [Jukes]_n1732 blithely, and [he]_p4630 strode into the cabin. [They]_p4631 followed [him]_p4632 with [their]_p4634 eyes [they]_p4635 scarce knew that [Hook]_n1733 had resumed [his]_p4636 song, [his]_p4637 dogs joining in with him:. ""Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat, [Its]_p4638 tails are nine, [you]_p4639 know, And when they're writ upon [your]_p4640 back,   What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. [It]_p4641 wailed through the ship, and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech. ""What was that?"".",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," cried [Hook]_n1734. ""Two,"". said [Slightly]_n1735 solemnly. The [Italian Cecco]_n1736 hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin. [He]_p4642 tottered out, haggard. ""What's the matter with [Bill Jukes]_n1737 , [you]_p4643 dog?"". hissed [Hook]_n1738 , towering over him. ""The matter wi' [him]_p4644 is he's dead, stabbed,"". replied [Cecco]_n1739 in a hollow voice. ""[Bill Jukes]_n1740 dead!"".",7,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," cried the startled pirates. ""The cabin's as black as a pit,"". [Cecco]_n1741 said, almost gibbering,. ""but there is something terrible in there: the thing [you]_p4645 heard crowing. The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were seen by [Hook]_n1742. ""[Cecco]_n1743 ,"". [he]_p4646 said in [his]_p4647 most steely voice,. ""go back and fetch [me]_p4648 out that doodle-doo. [Cecco]_n1744 , bravest of the brave, cowered before [his]_p4649 captain, crying. ""No, no"".",4,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," but [Hook]_n1745 was purring to [his]_p4650 claw. ""Did [you]_p4651 say [you]_p4652 would go, [Cecco]_n1746 ?"". [he]_p4653 said musingly. [Cecco]_n1747 went, first flinging [his]_p4654 arms despairingly. There was no more singing, all listened now and again came a death-screech and again a crow. No one spoke except [Slightly]_n1748. ""Three,"". [he]_p4655 said. [Hook]_n1749 rallied [his]_p4656 dogs with a gesture. "" S'death and odds fish,"".",5,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p4657 thundered,. ""who is to bring [me]_p4658 that doodle-doo?. ""Wait till [Cecco]_n1750 comes out,"". growled [Starkey]_n1751 , and the others took up the cry. ""[I]_p4659 think [I]_p4660 heard [you]_p4661 volunteer, [Starkey]_n1752 ,"". said [Hook]_n1753 , purring again. ""No, by thunder!"". [Starkey]_n1754 cried. ""[My]_p4662 hook thinks [you]_p4663 did,"". said [Hook]_n1755 , crossing to him.",6,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p4664 wonder if [it]_p4665 would not be advisable, [Starkey]_n1756 , to humour the hook?. ""I'll swing before [I]_p4666 go in there,"". replied [Starkey]_n1757 doggedly, and again [he]_p4668 had the support of the crew. ""Is this mutiny?"". asked [Hook]_n1758 more pleasantly than ever. ""[Starkey]_n1759 's ringleader!. ""[Captain]_n1760 , mercy!"". [Starkey]_n1761 whimpered, all of a tremble now. ""[Shake]_n1762 hands, [Starkey]_n1763 ,"". said [Hook]_n1764 , proffering [his]_p4669 claw.",9,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," [Starkey]_n1765 looked round for help, but all deserted him. As [he]_p4670 backed up [Hook]_n1766 advanced, and now the red spark was in [his]_p4671 eye. With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon [Long Tom]_n1767 and precipitated [himself]_p4672 into the sea. ""Four,"". said [Slightly]_n1768. ""And now,"". [Hook]_n1769 said courteously,. ""did any other gentlemen say mutiny?  Seizing a lantern and raising [his]_p4673 claw with a menacing gesture,. ""I'll bring out that doodle-doo myself,"". [he]_p4674 said, and sped into the cabin.",5,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Five. "". How [Slightly]_n1770 longed to say it. [He]_p4675 wetted [his]_p4676 lips to be ready, but [Hook]_n1771 came staggering out, without [his]_p4677 lantern. ""Something blew out the light,"". [he]_p4678 said a little unsteadily. ""Something!"". echoed [Mullins]_n1772. ""What of [Cecco]_n1773 ?"". demanded [Noodler]_n1774.",5,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""He's as dead as [Jukes]_n1775 ,"". said [Hook]_n1776 shortly. [His]_p4679 reluctance to return to the cabin impressed [them]_p4680 all unfavourably, and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are superstitious, and [Cookson]_n1777 cried,. ""[They]_p4681 do say the surest sign a ship's accurst is when there's one on board more than can be accounted for. ""I've heard,"". muttered [Mullins]_n1778 ,. ""[he]_p4682 always boards the pirate craft last. Had [he]_p4683 a tail, captain?. ""[They]_p4684 say,"".",4,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," said another, looking viciously at [Hook]_n1779 ,. ""that when [he]_p4685 comes it's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard. ""Had [he]_p4686 a hook, captain?"". asked [Cookson]_n1780 insolently and one after another took up the cry,. ""The ship's doomed!"". At this the children could not resist raising a cheer. [Hook]_n1781 had well-nigh forgotten [his]_p4687 prisoners, but as [he]_p4689 swung round on [them]_p4690 now [his]_p4688 face lit up again. ""Lads,"". [he]_p4691 cried to [his]_p4692 crew,. ""now here's a notion.",3,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," Open the cabin door and drive [them]_p4693 in. Let [them]_p4694 fight the doodle-doo for [their]_p4695 lives. If [they]_p4696 kill him, we're so much the better if [he]_p4697 kills them, we're none the worse. For the last time [his]_p4698 dogs admired [Hook]_n1782 , and devotedly [they]_p4700 did [his]_p4699 bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them. ""Now, listen!"". cried [Hook]_n1783 , and all listened. But not one dared to face the door. Yes, one, [Wendy]_n1784 , who all this time had been bound to the mast. [It]_p4701 was for neither a scream nor a crow that [she]_p4702 was watching, [it]_p4703 was for the reappearance of [Peter]_n1785.",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p4704 had not long to wait. In the cabin [he]_p4705 had found the thing for which [he]_p4706 had gone in search: the key that would free the children of [their]_p4707 manacles, and now [they]_p4708 all stole forth, armed with such weapons as [they]_p4709 could find. First signing [them]_p4710 to hide, [Peter]_n1786 cut [Wendy]_n1787 's bonds, and then nothing could have been easier than for [them]_p4711 all to fly off together but one thing barred the way, an oath,. ""[Hook]_n1788 or [me]_p4712 this time. So when [he]_p4713 had freed [Wendy]_n1789 , [he]_p4714 whispered for [her]_p4716 to conceal [herself]_p4720 with the others, and [himself]_p4721 took [her]_p4717 place by the mast, [her]_p4717 cloak around [him]_p4722 so that [he]_p4714 should pass for her. Then [he]_p4723 took a great breath and crowed. To the pirates [it]_p4724 was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin and [they]_p4725 were panic-stricken. [Hook]_n1790 tried to hearten [them]_p4726 but like the dogs [he]_p4729 had made [them]_p4727 [they]_p4732 showed [him]_p4734 [their]_p4736 fangs, and [he]_p4730 knew that if [he]_p4730 took [his]_p4737 eyes off [them]_p4727 now [they]_p4733 would leap at him. ""Lads,"". [he]_p4738 said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never quailing for an instant,.",5,,33,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I've thought [it]_p4739 out. There's a [Jonah]_n1791 aboard. ""Ay,"". [they]_p4740 snarled,. ""a man wi' a hook. ""No, lads, no, it's the girl. [Never]_n1792 was luck on a pirate ship wi' a woman on board. We'll right the ship when she's gone. Some of [them]_p4741 remembered that this had been a saying of [Flint]_n1793 's. ""It's worth trying,"".",3,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," [they]_p4742 said doubtfully. ""Fling the girl overboard,"". cried [Hook]_n1794 and [they]_p4743 made a rush at the figure in the cloak. ""There's none can save [you]_p4744 now, missy,"". [Mullins]_n1795 hissed jeeringly. ""There's one,"". replied the figure. ""Who's that?. ""[Peter Pan]_n1796 the avenger!"". came the terrible answer and as [he]_p4745 spoke [Peter]_n1797 flung off [his]_p4746 cloak.",4,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," Then [they]_p4747 all knew who twas that had been undoing [them]_p4748 in the cabin, and twice [Hook]_n1798 essayed to speak and twice [he]_p4749 failed. In that frightful moment [I]_p4750 think [his]_p4751 fierce heart broke. At last [he]_p4752 cried,. ""Cleave [him]_p4753 to the brisket!"". but without conviction. ""Down, boys, and at them!"". [Peter]_n1799 's voice rang out and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the pirates kept together [it]_p4754 is certain that [they]_p4755 would have won but the onset came when [they]_p4756 were still unstrung, and [they]_p4756 ran hither and thither, striking wildly, each thinking [himself]_p4758 the last survivor of the crew. Man to man [they]_p4759 were the stronger but [they]_p4760 fought on the defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose [their]_p4761 quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea others hid in dark recesses, where [they]_p4762 were found by [Slightly]_n1800 , who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which [he]_p4764 flashed in [their]_p4765 faces, so that [they]_p4763 were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys.",3,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and [Slightly]_n1801 monotonously counting, five, six, seven eight, nine, ten, eleven. [I]_p4766 think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded [Hook]_n1802 , who seemed to have a charmed life, as [he]_p4767 kept [them]_p4768 at bay in that circle of fire. [They]_p4769 had done for [his]_p4770 dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for [them]_p4771 all. Again and again [they]_p4772 closed upon him, and again and again [he]_p4773 hewed a clear space. [He]_p4774 had lifted up one boy with [his]_p4775 hook, and was using [him]_p4777 as a buckler [shield], when another, who had just passed [his]_p4776 sword through [Mullins]_n1803 , sprang into the fray. ""Put up [your]_p4778 swords, boys,"". cried the newcomer,. ""this man is mine. Thus suddenly [Hook]_n1804 found [himself]_p4779 face to face with [Peter]_n1805. The others drew back and formed a ring around them.",5,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," For long the two enemies looked at one another, [Hook]_n1806 shuddering slightly, and [Peter]_n1807 with the strange smile upon [his]_p4780 face. ""So, [Pan]_n1808 ,"". said [Hook]_n1809 at last,. ""this is all [your]_p4781 doing. ""Ay, [James Hook]_n1810 ,"". came the stern answer,. ""[it]_p4782 is all [my]_p4783 doing. ""[Proud]_n1811 and insolent youth,"". said [Hook]_n1812 ,. ""prepare to meet thy doom.",7,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Dark]_n1813 and sinister man,"". [Peter]_n1814 answered,. ""have at thee. Without more words [they]_p4784 fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to either blade. [Peter]_n1815 was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity ever and anon [he]_p4785 followed up a feint with a lunge that got past [his]_p4787 foe's defence, but [his]_p4788 shorter reach stood [him]_p4789 in ill stead, and [he]_p4786 could not drive the steel home. [Hook]_n1816 , scarcely [his]_p4790 inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced [him]_p4793 back by the weight of [his]_p4791 onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught [him]_p4794 long ago by [Barbecue]_n1817 at [Rio]_n1818 but to [his]_p4791 astonishment [he]_p4795 found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then [he]_p4796 sought to close and give the quietus with [his]_p4797 iron hook, which all this time had been pawing the air but [Peter]_n1819 doubled under [it]_p4798 and, lunging fiercely, pierced [him]_p4799 in the ribs. At the sight of [his]_p4800 own blood, whose peculiar colour, [you]_p4801 remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from [Hook]_n1820 's hand, and [he]_p4802 was at [Peter]_n1821 's mercy. ""Now!"". cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture [Peter]_n1822 invited [his]_p4803 opponent to pick up [his]_p4804 sword.",10,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," [Hook]_n1823 did so instantly, but with a tragic feeling that [Peter]_n1824 was showing good form. Hitherto [he]_p4805 had thought [it]_p4806 was some fiend fighting him, but darker suspicions assailed [him]_p4807 now. ""[Pan]_n1825 , who and what art thou?"". [he]_p4809 cried huskily. ""I'm youth, I'm joy,"". [Peter]_n1826 answered at a venture,. ""I'm a little bird that has broken out of the egg. This, of course, was nonsense but [it]_p4810 was proof to the unhappy [Hook]_n1827 that [Peter]_n1828 did not know in the least who or what [he]_p4811 was, which is the very pinnacle of good form. ""[To't]_n1829 again,"". [he]_p4812 cried despairingly.",7,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p4813 fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed [it]_p4814 but [Peter]_n1830 fluttered round [him]_p4816 as if the very wind [it]_p4815 made blew [him]_p4817 out of the danger zone. And again and again [he]_p4818 darted in and pricked. [Hook]_n1831 was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer asked for life but for one boon [it]_p4819 craved: to see [Peter]_n1832 show bad form before [it]_p4820 was cold forever. Abandoning the fight [he]_p4821 rushed into the powder magazine and fired it. ""In two minutes,"". [he]_p4822 cried,. ""the ship will be blown to pieces. Now, now, [he]_p4823 thought, true form will show. But [Peter]_n1833 issued from the powder magazine with the shell in [his]_p4824 hands, and calmly flung [it]_p4825 overboard.",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," What sort of form was [Hook]_n1834 [himself]_p4826 showing? Misguided man though [he]_p4827 was, [we]_p4829 may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end [he]_p4828 was true to the traditions of [his]_p4830 race. The other boys were flying around [him]_p4831 now, flouting, scornful and [he]_p4832 staggered about the deck striking up at [them]_p4833 impotently, [his]_p4835 mind was no longer with [them]_p4834 [it]_p4836 was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up [to the headmaster] for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And [his]_p4837 shoes were right, and [his]_p4838 waistcoat was right, and [his]_p4838 tie was right, and [his]_p4839 socks were right. [James Hook]_n1835 , thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell. For [we]_p4841 have come to [his]_p4842 last moment. Seeing [Peter]_n1836 slowly advancing upon [him]_p4843 through the air with dagger poised, [he]_p4844 sprang upon the bulwarks to cast [himself]_p4845 into the sea. [He]_p4846 did not know that the crocodile was waiting for [him]_p4847 for [we]_p4849 purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from [us]_p4850 at the end. [He]_p4851 had one last triumph, which [I]_p4852 think [we]_p4853 need not grudge him. As [he]_p4854 stood on the bulwark looking over [his]_p4856 shoulder at [Peter]_n1837 gliding through the air, [he]_p4855 invited [him]_p4858 with a gesture to use [his]_p4857 foot. [It]_p4859 made [Peter]_n1838 kick instead of stab.",5,,33,
barrie_peter_pan," At last [Hook]_n1839 had got the boon for which [he]_p4860 craved. ""Bad form,"". [he]_p4861 cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile. Thus perished [James Hook]_n1840. ""Seventeen,"". [Slightly]_n1841 sang out but [he]_p4862 was not quite correct in [his]_p4863 figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for [their]_p4864 crimes that night but two reached the shore: [Starkey]_n1842 to be captured by the redskins, who made [him]_p4866 nurse for all [their]_p4865 papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate and [Smee]_n1843 , who henceforth wandered about the world in [his]_p4867 spectacles, making a precarious living by saying [he]_p4868 was the only man that [Jas]_n1844. [Hook]_n1845 had feared. [Wendy]_n1846 , of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watching [Peter]_n1847 with glistening eyes but now that all was over [she]_p4869 became prominent again. [She]_p4870 praised [them]_p4871 equally, and shuddered delightfully when [Michael]_n1848 showed [her]_p4873 the place where [he]_p4874 had killed one and then [she]_p4875 took [them]_p4872 into [Hook]_n1849 's cabin and pointed to [his]_p4876 watch which was hanging on a nail.",11,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p4877 said. ""half-past one!   The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. [She]_p4878 got [them]_p4879 to bed in the pirates' bunks pretty quickly, [you]_p4880 may be sure all but [Peter]_n1850 , who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last [he]_p4881 fell [asleep]_n1851 by the side of [Long Tom]_n1852. [He]_p4882 had one of [his]_p4883 dreams that night, and cried in [his]_p4884 sleep for a long time, and [Wendy]_n1853 held [him]_p4885 tightly. Chapter 16 THE [RETURN HOME]_n1854 By three bells that morning [they]_p4886 were all stirring [their]_p4887 stumps [legs] for there was a big sea running and [Tootles]_n1855 , the bo'sun, was among them, with a rope's end in [his]_p4888 hand and chewing tobacco. [They]_p4889 all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with the true nautical roll and hitching [their]_p4890 trousers. [It]_p4891 need not be said who was the captain. [Nibs]_n1856 and [John]_n1857 were first and second mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars [sailors] before the mast, and lived in the fo'c'sle.",8,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n1858 had already lashed [himself]_p4892 to the wheel but [he]_p4893 piped all hands and delivered a short address to [them]_p4897 said [he]_p4894 hoped [they]_p4899 would do [their]_p4902 duty like gallant hearties, but that [he]_p4894 knew [they]_p4900 were the scum of [Rio]_n1859 and the [Gold Coast]_n1860 , and if [they]_p4900 snapped at [him]_p4903 [he]_p4895 would tear them. The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and [they]_p4904 cheered [him]_p4905 lustily. Then a few sharp orders were given, and [they]_p4906 turned the ship round, and nosed [her]_p4907 for the mainland. [Captain Pan]_n1861 calculated, after consulting the ship's chart, that if this weather lasted [they]_p4908 should strike the Azores about the 21st of [June]_n1862 , after which [it]_p4909 would save time to fly. Some of [them]_p4910 wanted [it]_p4912 to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping [it]_p4913 a pirate but the captain treated [them]_p4911 as dogs, and [they]_p4914 dared not express [their]_p4916 wishes to [him]_p4917 even in a round robin [one person after another, as [they]_p4915 had to Cpt. [Hook]_n1863 ]. Instant obedience was the only safe thing. [Slightly]_n1864 got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings. The general feeling was that [Peter]_n1865 was honest just now to lull [Wendy]_n1866 's suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against [her]_p4918 will, [she]_p4919 was making for [him]_p4920 out of some of [Hook]_n1867 's wickedest garments. [It]_p4921 was afterwards whispered among [them]_p4922 that on the first night [he]_p4923 wore this suit [he]_p4924 sat long in the cabin with [Hook]_n1868 's cigar-holder in [his]_p4926 mouth and one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which [he]_p4924 bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.",11,,34,
barrie_peter_pan," Instead of watching the ship, however, [we]_p4927 must now return to that desolate home from which three of [our]_p4928 characters had taken heartless flight so long ago. [It]_p4929 seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time and yet [we]_p4930 may be sure that [Mrs Darling]_n1869 does not blame us. If [we]_p4931 had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, [she]_p4932 would probably have cried,. ""Don't be silly what do [I]_p4933 matter? Do go back and keep an eye on the children. "". So long as mothers are like this [their]_p4934 children will take advantage of [them]_p4935 and [they]_p4936 may lay to [bet on] that. Even now [we]_p4937 venture into that familiar nursery only because [its]_p4939 lawful occupants are on [their]_p4940 way home [we]_p4938 are merely hurrying on in advance of [them]_p4942 to see that [their]_p4941 beds are properly aired and that Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n1870 do not go out for the evening. [We]_p4943 are no more than servants. Why on earth should [their]_p4944 beds be properly aired, seeing that [they]_p4946 left [them]_p4949 in such a thankless hurry? Would [it]_p4952 not serve [them]_p4950 jolly well right if [they]_p4947 came back and found that [their]_p4945 parents were spending the week-end in the country? [It]_p4953 would be the moral lesson [they]_p4947 have been in need of ever since [we]_p4954 met [them]_p4950 but if [we]_p4955 contrived things in this way [Mrs Darling]_n1871 would never forgive us.",3,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," [One]_n1872 thing [I]_p4956 should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed [they]_p4957 will be here on [Thursday]_n1873 week. This would spoil so completely the surprise to which [Wendy]_n1874 and [John]_n1875 and [Michael]_n1876 are looking forward. [They]_p4958 have been planning [it]_p4959 out on the ship: mother's rapture, father's shout of joy, [Nana]_n1877 's leap through the air to embrace [them]_p4960 first, when what [they]_p4961 ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil [it]_p4962 all by breaking the news in advance so that when [they]_p4963 enter grandly [Mrs Darling]_n1878 may not even offer [Wendy]_n1879 [her]_p4964 mouth, and [Mr Darling]_n1880 may exclaim pettishly,. ""Dash [it]_p4965 all, here are those boys again. "". However, [we]_p4966 should get no thanks even for this. [We]_p4967 are beginning to know [Mrs Darling]_n1881 by this time, and may be sure that [she]_p4968 would upbraid [us]_p4969 for depriving the children of [their]_p4970 little pleasure. ""But, [my]_p4971 dear madam, [it]_p4972 is ten days till [Thursday]_n1882 week so that by telling [you]_p4973 what's what, [we]_p4975 can save [you]_p4974 ten days of unhappiness. ""Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of delight.",11,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Oh, if [you]_p4976 look at [it]_p4977 in that way!. ""What other way is there in which to look at it?   [You]_p4978 see, the woman had no proper spirit. [I]_p4979 had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about [her]_p4982 but [I]_p4980 despise her, and not one of [them]_p4984 will [I]_p4980 say now. [She]_p4985 does not really need to be told to have things ready, for [they]_p4986 are ready. All the beds are aired, and [she]_p4987 never leaves the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use [we]_p4988 are to her, [we]_p4989 might well go back to the ship. However, as [we]_p4990 are here [we]_p4991 may as well stay and look on. That is all [we]_p4992 are, lookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let [us]_p4993 watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that some of [them]_p4994 will hurt.",0,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, [Mr Darling]_n1883 felt in [his]_p4995 bones that all the blame was [his]_p4996 for having chained [Nana]_n1884 up, and that from first to last [she]_p4997 had been wiser than he. Of course, as [we]_p4998 have seen, [he]_p4999 was quite a simple man indeed [he]_p5000 might have passed for a boy again if [he]_p5000 had been able to take [his]_p5004 baldness off  but [he]_p5001 had also a noble sense of justice and a lion's courage to do what seemed right to [him]_p5005 and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, [he]_p5001 went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel. To all [Mrs Darling]_n1885 's dear invitations to [him]_p5006 to come out [he]_p5007 replied sadly but firmly:. ""No, [my]_p5008 own one, this is the place for me. In the bitterness of [his]_p5009 remorse [he]_p5011 swore that [he]_p5012 would never leave the kennel until [his]_p5010 children came back. Of course this was a pity but whatever [Mr Darling]_n1886 did [he]_p5013 had to do in excess, otherwise [he]_p5014 soon gave up doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud [George Darling]_n1887 , as [he]_p5015 sat in the kennel of an evening talking with [his]_p5016 wife of [their]_p5017 children and all [their]_p5018 pretty ways. Very touching was [his]_p5019 deference to [Nana]_n1888. [He]_p5020 would not let [her]_p5021 come into the kennel, but on all other matters [he]_p5023 followed [her]_p5022 wishes implicitly.",6,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," Every morning the kennel was carried with [Mr Darling]_n1889 in [it]_p5024 to a cab, which conveyed [him]_p5025 to [his]_p5026 office, and [he]_p5027 returned home in the same way at six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if [we]_p5028 remember how sensitive [he]_p5029 was to the opinion of neighbours: this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly [he]_p5030 must have suffered torture but [he]_p5031 preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised [his]_p5033 little home, and [he]_p5031 always lifted [his]_p5034 hat courteously to any [lady]_n1890 who looked inside. [It]_p5035 may have been Quixotic, but [it]_p5036 was magnificent. Soon the inward meaning of [it]_p5037 leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched. Crowds followed the cab, cheering [it]_p5038 lustily charming girls scaled [it]_p5039 to get [his]_p5040 autograph interviews appeared in the better class of papers, and society invited [him]_p5041 to dinner and added,. ""Do come in the kennel. On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting [George]_n1891 's return home a very sad-eyed woman. Now that [we]_p5042 look at [her]_p5043 closely and remember the gaiety of [her]_p5044 in the old days, all gone now just because [she]_p5047 has lost [her]_p5044 babes, [I]_p5048 find [I]_p5049 won't be able to say nasty things about [her]_p5045 after all. If [she]_p5050 was too fond of [her]_p5052 rubbishy children, [she]_p5051 couldn't help it.",3,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," Look at [her]_p5053 in [her]_p5054 chair, where [she]_p5055 has fallen [asleep]_n1892. The corner of [her]_p5056 mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up. [Her]_p5057 hand moves restlessly on [her]_p5058 breast as if [she]_p5059 had a pain there. Some like [Peter]_n1893 best, and some like [Wendy]_n1894 best, but [I]_p5060 like [her]_p5061 best. Suppose, to make [her]_p5062 happy, [we]_p5065 whisper to [her]_p5063 in [her]_p5063 sleep that the brats are coming back. [They]_p5066 are really within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all [we]_p5067 need whisper is that [they]_p5068 are on the way. Let's. [It]_p5069 is a pity [we]_p5070 did it, for [she]_p5071 has started up, calling [their]_p5072 names and there is no one in the room but [Nana]_n1895. ""[O Nana]_n1896 , [I]_p5073 dreamt [my]_p5074 dear ones had come back. [Nana]_n1897 had filmy eyes, but all [she]_p5075 could do was put [her]_p5076 paw gently on [her]_p5077 mistress's lap and [they]_p5078 were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back.",6,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," As [Mr Darling]_n1898 puts [his]_p5079 head out to kiss [his]_p5080 wife, [we]_p5082 see that [his]_p5080 face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression. [He]_p5083 gave [his]_p5084 hat to [Liza]_n1899 , who took [it]_p5085 scornfully for [she]_p5086 had no imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering, and [he]_p5087 was naturally not unmoved. ""[Listen]_n1900 to them,"". [he]_p5088 said. ""[it]_p5089 is very gratifying. ""Lots of little boys,"". sneered [Liza]_n1901. ""There were several adults [to-day]_n1902 ,"". [he]_p5090 assured [her]_p5092 with a faint flush  but when [she]_p5095 tossed [her]_p5093 head [he]_p5091 had not a word of reproof for her.",5,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," Social success had not spoilt [him]_p5096 [it]_p5098 had made [him]_p5097 sweeter. For some time [he]_p5099 sat with [his]_p5100 head out of the kennel, talking with [Mrs Darling]_n1903 of this success, and pressing [her]_p5102 hand reassuringly when [she]_p5103 said [she]_p5104 hoped [his]_p5101 head would not be turned by it. ""But if [I]_p5105 had been a weak man,"". [he]_p5106 said. ""Good heavens, if [I]_p5107 had been a weak man!. ""And, [George]_n1904 ,"". [she]_p5108 said timidly,. ""[you]_p5109 are as full of remorse as ever, aren't you?. ""Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See [my]_p5111 punishment: living in a kennel. ""But [it]_p5112 is punishment, isn't it, [George]_n1905 ? [You]_p5115 are sure [you]_p5116 are not enjoying it?.",3,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[My]_p5117 love!   [You]_p5118 may be sure [she]_p5119 begged [his]_p5120 pardon and then, feeling drowsy, [he]_p5121 curled round in the kennel. ""Won't [you]_p5122 play [me]_p5123 to sleep,"". [he]_p5124 asked,. ""on the nursery piano?"". and as [she]_p5125 was crossing to the day-nursery [he]_p5126 added thoughtlessly,. ""And shut that window. [I]_p5127 feel a draught. ""[O George]_n1906 , never ask [me]_p5128 to do that. The window must always be left open for them, always, always. Now [it]_p5129 was [his]_p5130 turn to beg [her]_p5131 pardon and [she]_p5132 went into the day-nursery and played, and soon [he]_p5133 was [asleep]_n1907 and while [he]_p5134 slept, [Wendy]_n1908 and [John]_n1909 and [Michael]_n1910 flew into the room.",5,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," Oh no. [We]_p5135 have written [it]_p5136 so, because that was the charming arrangement planned by [them]_p5139 before [we]_p5140 left the ship but something must have happened since then, for [it]_p5137 is not [they]_p5141 who have flown in, [it]_p5137 is Peter and [Tinker Bell]_n1911. [Peter]_n1912 's first words tell all. ""[Quick Tink]_n1913 ,"". [he]_p5142 whispered,. ""close the window bar it! That's right. Now [you]_p5143 and [I]_p5144 must get away by the door and when [Wendy]_n1914 comes [she]_p5145 will think [her]_p5147 mother has barred [her]_p5148 out and [she]_p5146 will have to go back with me. Now [I]_p5149 understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when [Peter]_n1915 had exterminated the pirates [he]_p5150 did not return to the island and leave [Tink]_n1916 to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in [his]_p5151 head all the time. Instead of feeling that [he]_p5152 was behaving badly [he]_p5153 danced with glee then [he]_p5153 peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing.",6,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p5155 whispered to [Tink]_n1917 ,. ""It's [Wendy]_n1918 's mother! [She]_p5156 is a pretty [lady]_n1919 , but not so pretty as [my]_p5157 mother. [Her]_p5158 mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as [my]_p5159 mother's was. Of course [he]_p5160 knew nothing whatever about [his]_p5162 mother but [he]_p5161 sometimes bragged about her. [He]_p5163 did not know the tune, which was. ""[Home]_n1920 , [Sweet]_n1921 [Home]_n1922 ,"". but [he]_p5164 knew [it]_p5165 was saying,. ""Come back, [Wendy]_n1923 , [Wendy][_n , ]_n Wendy"". and [he]_p5166 cried exultantly,. ""[You]_p5167 will never see [Wendy]_n1924 again, [lady]_n1925 , for the window is barred! [He]_p5168 peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now [he]_p5169 saw that [Mrs Darling]_n1926 had laid [her]_p5170 head on the box, and that two tears were sitting on [her]_p5171 eyes.",11,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[She]_p5172 wants [me]_p5173 to unbar the window,"". thought [Peter]_n1927 ,. ""but [I]_p5174 won't, not I!   [He]_p5176 peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had taken [their]_p5177 place. ""She's awfully fond of [Wendy]_n1928 ,"". [he]_p5178 said to himself. [He]_p5179 was angry with [her]_p5180 now for not seeing why [she]_p5181 could not have [Wendy]_n1929. The reason was so simple:. ""I'm fond of [her]_p5182 too. [We]_p5183 can't both have her, [lady]_n1930. But the [lady]_n1931 would not make the best of it, and [he]_p5184 was unhappy.",5,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p5185 ceased to look at her, but even then [she]_p5186 would not let go of him. [He]_p5187 skipped about and made funny faces, but when [he]_p5188 stopped [it]_p5189 was just as if [she]_p5190 were inside him, knocking. ""Oh, all right,"". [he]_p5191 said at last, and gulped. Then [he]_p5192 unbarred the window. ""Come on, [Tink]_n1932 ,"". [he]_p5193 cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature. ""[we]_p5194 don't want any silly mothers "". and [he]_p5195 flew away. Thus [Wendy]_n1933 and [John]_n1934 and [Michael]_n1935 found the window open for [them]_p5196 after all, which of course was more than [they]_p5197 deserved.",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p5198 alighted on the floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already forgotten [his]_p5199 home. ""[John]_n1936 ,"". [he]_p5200 said, looking around [him]_p5201 doubtfully,. ""[I]_p5202 think [I]_p5203 have been here before. ""Of course [you]_p5204 have, [you]_p5205 silly. There is [your]_p5206 old bed. ""So [it]_p5207 is,"". [Michael]_n1937 said, but not with much conviction. ""[I]_p5208 say,"". cried [John]_n1938 ,.",3,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," ""the kennel!"". and [he]_p5209 dashed across to look into it. ""Perhaps [Nana]_n1939 is inside it,"". [Wendy]_n1940 said. But [John]_n1941 whistled. ""[Hullo]_n1942 ,"". [he]_p5210 said,. ""there's a man inside it. ""It's father!"". exclaimed [Wendy]_n1943.",5,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Let [me]_p5211 see father,"". [Michael]_n1944 begged eagerly, and [he]_p5212 took a good look. ""[He]_p5213 is not so big as the pirate [I]_p5214 killed,"". [he]_p5215 said with such frank disappointment that [I]_p5217 am glad [Mr Darling]_n1945 was [asleep]_n1946 [it]_p5218 would have been sad if those had been the first words [he]_p5216 heard [his]_p5219 little [Michael]_n1947 say. [Wendy]_n1948 and [John]_n1949 had been taken aback somewhat at finding [their]_p5220 father in the kennel. ""Surely,"". said [John]_n1950 , like one who had lost faith in [his]_p5221 memory,. ""[he]_p5222 used not to sleep in the kennel?. ""[John]_n1951 ,"". [Wendy]_n1952 said falteringly,.",9,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""perhaps [we]_p5223 don't remember the old life as well as [we]_p5224 thought [we]_p5224 did. A chill fell upon [them]_p5226 and serve [them]_p5227 right. ""[It]_p5228 is very careless of mother,"". said that young scoundrel [John]_n1953 ,. ""not to be here when [we]_p5229 come back. [It]_p5230 was then that [Mrs Darling]_n1954 began playing again. ""It's mother!"". cried [Wendy]_n1955 , peeping. ""So [it]_p5231 is!"". said [John]_n1956.",4,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Then are [you]_p5232 not really [our]_p5233 mother, [Wendy]_n1957 ?"". asked [Michael]_n1958 , who was surely sleepy. ""Oh dear!"". exclaimed [Wendy]_n1959 , with [her]_p5234 first real twinge of remorse [for having gone],. ""[it]_p5235 was quite time [we]_p5236 came back. ""Let [us]_p5237 creep in,"". [John]_n1960 suggested,. ""and put [our]_p5238 hands over [her]_p5239 eyes. But [Wendy]_n1961 , who saw that [they]_p5240 must break the joyous news more gently, had a better plan. ""Let [us]_p5241 all slip into [our]_p5242 beds, and be there when [she]_p5243 comes in, just as if [we]_p5244 had never been away.",5,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," And so when [Mrs Darling]_n1962 went back to the night-nursery to see if [her]_p5245 husband was [asleep]_n1963 , all the beds were occupied. The children waited for [her]_p5246 cry of joy, but [it]_p5247 did not come. [She]_p5248 saw them, but [she]_p5249 did not believe [they]_p5250 were there. [You]_p5251 see, [she]_p5252 saw [them]_p5254 in [their]_p5255 beds so often in [her]_p5256 dreams that [she]_p5253 thought this was just the dream hanging around [her]_p5257 still. [She]_p5258 sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days [she]_p5259 had nursed them. [They]_p5260 could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them. ""[Mother]_n1964 !"". [Wendy]_n1965 cried. ""That's [Wendy]_n1966 ,"". [she]_p5261 said, but still [she]_p5262 was sure [it]_p5263 was the dream.",5,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Mother]_n1967 !. ""That's [John]_n1968 ,"". [she]_p5264 said. ""[Mother]_n1969 !"". cried [Michael]_n1970. [He]_p5265 knew [her]_p5266 now. ""That's [Michael]_n1971 ,"". [she]_p5267 said, and [she]_p5268 stretched out [her]_p5269 arms for the three little selfish children [they]_p5270 would never envelop again. Yes, [they]_p5271 did, [they]_p5272 went round [Wendy]_n1972 and [John]_n1973 and [Michael]_n1974 , who had slipped out of bed and run to her. ""[George]_n1975 , [George]_n1976 !"".",10,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p5273 cried when [she]_p5274 could speak and [Mr Darling]_n1977 woke to share [her]_p5275 bliss, and [Nana]_n1978 came rushing in. There could not have been a lovelier sight but there was none to see [it]_p5276 except a little boy who was staring in at the window. [He]_p5277 had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know but [he]_p5278 was looking through the window at the one joy from which [he]_p5279 must be for ever barred. Chapter 17 WHEN [WENDY GREW]_n1979 UP [I]_p5280 hope [you]_p5281 want to know what became of the other boys. [They]_p5282 were waiting below to give [Wendy]_n1980 time to explain about [them]_p5283 and when [they]_p5284 had counted five hundred [they]_p5285 went up. [They]_p5286 went up by the stair, because [they]_p5287 thought this would make a better impression. [They]_p5288 stood in a row in front of [Mrs Darling]_n1981 , with [their]_p5289 hats off, and wishing [they]_p5291 were not wearing [their]_p5290 pirate clothes. [They]_p5292 said nothing, but [their]_p5293 eyes asked [her]_p5294 to have them. [They]_p5295 ought to have looked at [Mr Darling]_n1982 also, but [they]_p5296 forgot about him. Of course [Mrs Darling]_n1983 said at once that [she]_p5297 would have [them]_p5298 but [Mr Darling]_n1984 was curiously depressed, and [they]_p5299 saw that [he]_p5300 considered six a rather large number.",8,,28,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p5301 must say,"". [he]_p5302 said to [Wendy]_n1985 ,. ""that [you]_p5303 don't do things by halves,"". a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them. The first twin was the proud one, and [he]_p5304 asked, flushing,. ""Do [you]_p5305 think [we]_p5306 should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, [we]_p5307 can go away. ""[Father]_n1986 !"". [Wendy]_n1987 cried, shocked but still the cloud was on him. [He]_p5308 knew [he]_p5309 was behaving unworthily, but [he]_p5310 could not help it. ""[We]_p5311 could lie doubled up,"".",3,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Nibs]_n1988. ""[I]_p5312 always cut [their]_p5313 hair myself,"". said [Wendy]_n1989. ""[George]_n1990 !"". [Mrs Darling]_n1991 exclaimed, pained to see [her]_p5314 dear one showing [himself]_p5315 in such an unfavourable light. Then [he]_p5316 burst into tears, and the truth came out. [He]_p5317 was as glad to have [them]_p5318 as [she]_p5319 was, [he]_p5320 said, but [he]_p5321 thought [they]_p5322 should have asked [his]_p5323 consent as well as hers, instead of treating [him]_p5325 as a cypher [zero] in [his]_p5324 own house. ""[I]_p5326 don't think [he]_p5327 is a cypher,"". [Tootles]_n1992 cried instantly. ""Do [you]_p5328 think [he]_p5329 is a cypher, [Curly]_n1993 ?.",6,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No, [I]_p5330 don't. Do [you]_p5331 think [he]_p5332 is a cypher, [Slightly]_n1994 ?. ""Rather not. [Twin]_n1995 , what do [you]_p5333 think? [It]_p5334 turned out that not one of [them]_p5335 thought [him]_p5337 a cypher and [he]_p5338 was absurdly gratified, and said [he]_p5339 would find space for [them]_p5336 all in the drawing-room if [they]_p5340 fitted in. ""We'll fit in, sir,"". [they]_p5341 assured him. ""Then follow the leader,"". [he]_p5342 cried gaily. ""Mind you, [I]_p5343 am not sure that [we]_p5344 have a drawing-room, but [we]_p5345 pretend [we]_p5345 have, and it's all the same. Hoop la!   [He]_p5347 went off dancing through the house, and [they]_p5348 all cried.",2,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Hoop la!"". and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room and [I]_p5349 forget whether [they]_p5350 found it, but at any rate [they]_p5351 found corners, and [they]_p5351 all fitted in. As for [Peter]_n1996 , [he]_p5353 saw [Wendy]_n1997 once again before [he]_p5354 flew away. [He]_p5355 did not exactly come to the window, but [he]_p5356 brushed against [it]_p5357 in passing so that [she]_p5359 could open [it]_p5358 if [she]_p5360 liked and call to him. That is what [she]_p5361 did. ""[Hullo]_n1998 , [Wendy]_n1999 , good-bye,"". [he]_p5362 said. ""Oh dear, are [you]_p5363 going away?. ""Yes. ""[You]_p5364 don't feel, [Peter]_n2000 ,"".",5,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p5365 said falteringly,. ""that [you]_p5366 would like to say anything to [my]_p5367 parents about a very sweet subject?. ""No. ""About me, [Peter]_n2001 ?. ""No. [Mrs Darling]_n2002 came to the window, for at present [she]_p5368 was keeping a sharp eye on [Wendy]_n2003. [She]_p5369 told [Peter]_n2004 that [she]_p5370 had adopted all the other boys, and would like to adopt [him]_p5371 also. ""Would [you]_p5372 send [me]_p5373 to school?"". [he]_p5374 inquired craftily. ""Yes.",4,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""And then to an office?. ""[I]_p5375 suppose so. ""Soon [I]_p5376 would be a man?. ""Very soon. ""[I]_p5377 don't want to go to school and learn solemn things,"". [he]_p5378 told [her]_p5379 passionately. ""[I]_p5380 don't want to be a man. O [Wendy]_n2005 's mother, if [I]_p5381 was to wake up and feel there was a beard!. ""[Peter]_n2006 ,"". said [Wendy]_n2007 the comforter,.",3,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[I]_p5382 should love [you]_p5383 in a beard "". and [Mrs Darling]_n2008 stretched out [her]_p5384 arms to him, but [he]_p5386 repulsed her. ""Keep back, [lady]_n2009 , no one is going to catch [me]_p5387 and make [me]_p5388 a man. ""But where are [you]_p5389 going to live?. ""With [Tink]_n2010 in the house [we]_p5390 built for [Wendy]_n2011. The fairies are to put [it]_p5391 high up among the tree tops where [they]_p5392 sleep at nights. ""How lovely,"". cried [Wendy]_n2012 so longingly that [Mrs Darling]_n2013 tightened [her]_p5393 grip. ""[I]_p5394 thought all the fairies were dead,"". [Mrs Darling]_n2014 said.",7,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""There are always a lot of young ones,"". explained [Wendy]_n2015 , who was now quite an authority,. ""because [you]_p5395 see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies. [They]_p5396 live in nests on the tops of trees and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what [they]_p5397 are. ""[I]_p5398 shall have such fun,"". said [Peter]_n2016 , with eye on [Wendy]_n2017. ""[It]_p5399 will be rather lonely in the evening,"". [she]_p5400 said,. ""sitting by the fire. ""[I]_p5401 shall have [Tink]_n2018.",4,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Tink]_n2019 can't go a twentieth part of the way round,"". [she]_p5402 reminded [him]_p5403 a little tartly. ""Sneaky tell-tale!"". [Tink]_n2020 called out from somewhere round the corner. ""[It]_p5404 doesn't matter,"". [Peter]_n2021 said. ""[O Peter]_n2022 , [you]_p5405 know [it]_p5406 matters. ""Well, then, come with [me]_p5407 to the little house. ""May I, [mummy]_n2023 ?. ""Certainly not.",5,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [I]_p5408 have got [you]_p5410 home again, and [I]_p5409 mean to keep you. ""But [he]_p5412 does so need a mother. ""So do you, [my]_p5413 love. ""Oh, all right,"". [Peter]_n2024 said, as if [he]_p5414 had asked [her]_p5415 from politeness merely but [Mrs Darling]_n2025 saw [his]_p5416 mouth twitch, and [she]_p5418 made this handsome offer: to let [Wendy]_n2026 go to [him]_p5419 for a week every year to do [his]_p5417 spring cleaning. [Wendy]_n2027 would have preferred a more permanent arrangement and [it]_p5420 seemed to [her]_p5421 that spring would be long in coming but this promise sent [Peter]_n2028 away quite gay again. [He]_p5422 had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all [I]_p5423 have told [you]_p5424 about [him]_p5425 is only a halfpenny-worth of them. [I]_p5426 suppose [it]_p5427 was because [Wendy]_n2029 knew this that [her]_p5428 last words to [him]_p5429 were these rather plaintive ones:. ""[You]_p5430 won't forget me, [Peter]_n2030 , will you, before spring cleaning time comes? Of course [Peter]_n2031 promised and then [he]_p5431 flew away. [He]_p5432 took [Mrs Darling]_n2032 's kiss with him.",9,,24,
barrie_peter_pan," The kiss that had been for no one else, [Peter]_n2033 took quite easily. [Funny]_n2034. But [she]_p5433 seemed satisfied. Of course all the boys went to school and most of [them]_p5434 got into [Class III]_n2035 , but [Slightly]_n2036 was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. [Class]_n2037 [I]_p5435 is the top class. Before [they]_p5436 had attended school a week [they]_p5437 saw what goats [they]_p5437 had been not to remain on the island but [it]_p5440 was too late now, and soon [they]_p5438 settled down to being as ordinary as [you]_p5441 or [me]_p5442 or [Jenkins]_n2038 minor [the younger [Jenkins]_n2039 ]. [It]_p5443 is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them. At first [Nana]_n2040 tied [their]_p5444 feet to the bed-posts so that [they]_p5447 should not fly away in the night and one of [their]_p5445 diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses [the [English]_n2041 double-deckers] but by and by [they]_p5448 ceased to tug at [their]_p5445 bonds in bed, and found that [they]_p5448 hurt [themselves]_p5451 when [they]_p5449 let go of the bus. In time [they]_p5452 could not even fly after [their]_p5453 hats. Want of practice, [they]_p5454 called [it]_p5456 but what [it]_p5457 really meant was that [they]_p5455 no longer believed.",9,,25,
barrie_peter_pan," [Michael]_n2042 believed longer than the other boys, though [they]_p5458 jeered at [him]_p5459 so [he]_p5460 was with [Wendy]_n2043 when [Peter]_n2044 came for [her]_p5461 at the end of the first year. [She]_p5462 flew away with Peter in the frock [she]_p5463 had woven from leaves and berries in the [Neverland]_n2045 , and [her]_p5464 one fear was that [he]_p5465 might notice how short [it]_p5468 had become but [he]_p5466 never noticed, [he]_p5466 had so much to say about himself. [She]_p5469 had looked forward to thrilling talks with [him]_p5470 about old times, but new adventures had crowded the old ones from [his]_p5471 mind. ""Who is [Captain Hook]_n2046 ?"". [he]_p5472 asked with interest when [she]_p5473 spoke of the arch enemy. ""Don't [you]_p5474 remember,"". [she]_p5475 asked, amazed,. ""how [you]_p5476 killed [him]_p5477 and saved all [our]_p5478 lives?. ""[I]_p5479 forget [them]_p5481 after [I]_p5480 kill them,"". [he]_p5483 replied carelessly.",5,,25,
barrie_peter_pan," When [she]_p5484 expressed a doubtful hope that [Tinker Bell]_n2047 would be glad to see [her]_p5485 [he]_p5486 said,. ""Who is [Tinker Bell]_n2048 ?. ""[O Peter]_n2049 ,"". [she]_p5487 said, shocked but even when [she]_p5488 explained [he]_p5489 could not remember. ""There are such a lot of them,"". [he]_p5490 said. ""[I]_p5491 expect [she]_p5492 is no more. [I]_p5493 expect [he]_p5494 was right, for fairies don't live long, but [they]_p5495 are so little that a short time seems a good while to them. [Wendy]_n2050 was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to [Peter]_n2051 [it]_p5496 had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But [he]_p5497 was exactly as fascinating as ever, and [they]_p5498 had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.",5,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [Next]_n2052 year [he]_p5499 did not come for her. [She]_p5500 waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but [he]_p5501 never came. ""Perhaps [he]_p5502 is ill,"". [Michael]_n2053 said. ""[You]_p5503 know [he]_p5504 is never ill. [Michael]_n2054 came close to [her]_p5505 and whispered, with a shiver,. ""Perhaps there is no such person, [Wendy]_n2055 !"". and then [Wendy]_n2056 would have cried if [Michael]_n2057 had not been crying. [Peter]_n2058 came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that [he]_p5506 never knew [he]_p5507 had missed a year. That was the last time the girl [Wendy]_n2059 ever saw him.",8,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," For a little longer [she]_p5508 tried for [his]_p5512 sake not to have growing pains and [she]_p5509 felt [she]_p5509 was untrue to [him]_p5513 when [she]_p5510 got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and when [they]_p5514 met again [Wendy]_n2060 was a married woman, and [Peter]_n2061 was no more to [her]_p5515 than a little dust in the box in which [she]_p5517 had kept [her]_p5516 toys. [Wendy]_n2062 was grown up. [You]_p5518 need not be sorry for her. [She]_p5519 was one of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end [she]_p5520 grew up of [her]_p5521 own free will a day quicker than other girls. All the boys were grown up and done for by this time so [it]_p5522 is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them. [You]_p5523 may see the twins and [Nibs]_n2063 and [Curly]_n2064 any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella. [Michael]_n2065 is an engine-driver [train engineer]. [Slightly]_n2066 married a [lady]_n2067 of title, and so [he]_p5524 became a lord.",8,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [You]_p5525 see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be [Tootles]_n2068. The bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell [his]_p5526 children was once [John]_n2069. [Wendy]_n2070 was married in white with a pink sash. [It]_p5527 is strange to think that [Peter]_n2071 did not alight in the church and forbid the banns [formal announcement of a marriage]. Years rolled on again, and [Wendy]_n2072 had a daughter. This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash. [She]_p5528 was called [Jane]_n2073 , and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from the moment [she]_p5529 arrived on the mainland [she]_p5530 wanted to ask questions. When [she]_p5531 was old enough to ask [them]_p5532 [they]_p5533 were mostly about [Peter Pan]_n2074. [She]_p5534 loved to hear of [Peter]_n2075 , and [Wendy]_n2076 told [her]_p5535 all [she]_p5536 could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. [It]_p5537 was [Jane]_n2077 's nursery now, for [her]_p5538 father had bought [it]_p5539 at the three per cents [mortgage rate] from [Wendy]_n2078 's father, who was no longer fond of stairs.",11,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mrs Darling]_n2079 was now dead and forgotten. There were only two beds in the nursery now, [Jane]_n2080 's and [her]_p5540 nurse's and there was no kennel, for [Nana]_n2081 also had passed away. [She]_p5541 died of old age, and at the end [she]_p5542 had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself. Once a week [Jane]_n2082 's nurse had [her]_p5543 evening off and then [it]_p5544 was [Wendy]_n2083 's part to put [Jane]_n2084 to bed. That was the time for stories. [It]_p5545 was [Jane]_n2085 's invention to raise the sheet over [her]_p5546 mother's head and [her]_p5547 own, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:. ""What do [we]_p5548 see now?. ""[I]_p5549 don't think [I]_p5550 see anything [to-night]_n2086 ,"". says [Wendy]_n2087 , with a feeling that if [Nana]_n2088 were here [she]_p5551 would object to further conversation. ""Yes, [you]_p5552 do,"".",10,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," says [Jane]_n2089 ,. ""[you]_p5553 see when [you]_p5554 were a little girl. ""That is a long time ago, sweetheart,"". says [Wendy]_n2090. ""Ah me, how time flies!. ""Does [it]_p5555 fly,"". asks the artful child,. ""the way [you]_p5556 flew when [you]_p5557 were a little girl?. ""The way [I]_p5558 flew? Do [you]_p5561 know, [Jane]_n2091 , [I]_p5559 sometimes wonder whether [I]_p5559 ever did really fly. ""Yes, [you]_p5562 did.",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""The dear old days when [I]_p5563 could fly!. ""Why can't [you]_p5564 fly now, mother?. ""Because [I]_p5565 am grown up, dearest. When people grow up [they]_p5566 forget the way. ""Why do [they]_p5567 forget the way?. ""Because [they]_p5568 are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. [It]_p5569 is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly. ""What is gay and innocent and heartless? [I]_p5570 do wish [I]_p5571 were gay and innocent and heartless. Or perhaps [Wendy]_n2092 admits [she]_p5572 does see something. ""[I]_p5573 do believe,"".",1,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p5574 says,. ""that [it]_p5575 is this nursery. ""[I]_p5576 do believe [it]_p5577 is,"". says [Jane]_n2093. ""Go on. [They]_p5578 are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when [Peter]_n2094 flew in looking for [his]_p5579 shadow. ""The foolish fellow,"". says [Wendy]_n2095 ,. ""tried to stick [it]_p5580 on with soap, and when [he]_p5582 could not [he]_p5583 cried, and that woke me, and [I]_p5584 sewed [it]_p5581 on for him. ""[You]_p5585 have missed a bit,"".",3,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," interrupts [Jane]_n2096 , who now knows the story better than [her]_p5586 mother. ""When [you]_p5587 saw [him]_p5589 sitting on the floor crying, what did [you]_p5588 say?. ""[I]_p5590 sat up in bed and [I]_p5591 said, [Boy]_n2097 , why are [you]_p5592 crying?'. ""Yes, that was it,"". says [Jane]_n2098 , with a big breath. ""And then [he]_p5593 flew [us]_p5594 all away to the [Neverland]_n2099 and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaids' lagoon, and the home under the ground, and the little house. ""Yes! which did [you]_p5595 like best of all?. ""[I]_p5596 think [I]_p5597 liked the home under the ground best of all. ""Yes, so do I. What was the last thing [Peter]_n2100 ever said to you?.",5,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""The last thing [he]_p5598 ever said to [me]_p5599 was, Just always be waiting for me, and then some night [you]_p5602 will hear [me]_p5600 crowing. '. ""Yes. ""But, alas, [he]_p5603 forgot all about me,"". [Wendy]_n2101 said [it]_p5604 with a smile. [She]_p5605 was as grown up as that. ""What did [his]_p5606 crow sound like?"". [Jane]_n2102 asked one evening. ""[It]_p5607 was like this,"". [Wendy]_n2103 said, trying to imitate [Peter]_n2104 's crow.",4,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No, [it]_p5608 wasn't,"". [Jane]_n2105 said gravely,. ""[it]_p5609 was like this "". and [she]_p5610 did [it]_p5611 ever so much better than [her]_p5612 mother. [Wendy]_n2106 was a little startled. ""[My]_p5613 darling, how can [you]_p5614 know?. ""[I]_p5615 often hear [it]_p5617 when [I]_p5616 am sleeping,"". [Jane]_n2107 said. ""Ah yes, many girls hear [it]_p5618 when [they]_p5620 are sleeping, but [I]_p5621 was the only one who heard [it]_p5619 awake. ""Lucky you,"".",3,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Jane]_n2108. And then one night came the tragedy. [It]_p5622 was the spring of the year, and the story had been told for the night, and [Jane]_n2109 was now [asleep]_n2110 in [her]_p5623 bed. [Wendy]_n2111 was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery and while [she]_p5624 sat darning [she]_p5625 heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and [Peter]_n2112 dropped in on the floor. [He]_p5626 was exactly the same as ever, and [Wendy]_n2113 saw at once that [he]_p5627 still had all [his]_p5628 first teeth. [He]_p5629 was a little boy, and [she]_p5630 was grown up. [She]_p5631 huddled by the fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman. ""[Hullo]_n2114 , [Wendy]_n2115 ,"". [he]_p5632 said, not noticing any difference, for [he]_p5633 was thinking chiefly of [himself]_p5635 and in the dim light [her]_p5636 white dress might have been the nightgown in which [he]_p5633 had seen [her]_p5637 first.",8,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Hullo]_n2116 , [Peter]_n2117 ,"". [she]_p5638 replied faintly, squeezing [herself]_p5639 as small as possible. Something inside [her]_p5640 was crying. ""[Woman]_n2118 , [Woman]_n2119 , let go of me. ""[Hullo]_n2120 , where is [John]_n2121 ?"". [he]_p5641 asked, suddenly missing the third bed. ""[John]_n2122 is not here now,"". [she]_p5642 gasped. ""Is [Michael]_n2123 [asleep]_n2124 ?"". [he]_p5643 asked, with a careless glance at [Jane]_n2125.",10,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes,"". [she]_p5644 answered and now [she]_p5645 felt that [she]_p5645 was untrue to [Jane]_n2126 as well as to [Peter]_n2127. ""That is not [Michael]_n2128 ,"". [she]_p5647 said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on her. [Peter]_n2129 looked. ""[Hullo]_n2130 , is [it]_p5648 a new one?. ""Yes. ""[Boy]_n2131 or girl?. ""Girl. Now surely [he]_p5649 would understand but not a bit of it.",6,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Peter]_n2132 ,"". [she]_p5650 said, faltering,. ""are [you]_p5651 expecting [me]_p5653 to fly away with you?. ""Of course that is why [I]_p5654 have come. "". [He]_p5655 added a little sternly,. ""Have [you]_p5656 forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?   [She]_p5657 knew [it]_p5658 was useless to say that [he]_p5659 had let many spring cleaning times pass. ""[I]_p5660 can't come,"". [she]_p5661 said apologetically,. ""[I]_p5662 have forgotten how to fly.",1,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I'll soon teach [you]_p5663 again. ""[O Peter]_n2133 , don't waste the fairy dust on me. [She]_p5664 had risen and now at last a fear assailed him. ""What is it?"". [he]_p5665 cried, shrinking. ""[I]_p5666 will turn up the light,"". [she]_p5667 said,. ""and then [you]_p5668 can see for yourself. For almost the only time in [his]_p5669 life that [I]_p5670 know of, [Peter]_n2134 was afraid. ""Don't turn up the light,"".",2,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p5671 cried. [She]_p5672 let [her]_p5673 hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. [She]_p5674 was not a little girl heart-broken about [him]_p5675 [she]_p5676 was a grown woman smiling at [it]_p5677 all, but [they]_p5678 were wet-eyed smiles. Then [she]_p5679 turned up the light, and [Peter]_n2135 saw. [He]_p5680 gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift [him]_p5681 in [her]_p5682 arms [he]_p5683 drew back sharply. ""What is it?"". [he]_p5684 cried again. [She]_p5685 had to tell him. ""[I]_p5686 am old, [Peter]_n2136. [I]_p5687 am ever so much more than twenty.",2,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [I]_p5688 grew up long ago. ""[You]_p5689 promised not to!. ""[I]_p5690 couldn't help it. [I]_p5691 am a married woman, [Peter]_n2137. ""No, you're not. ""Yes, and the little girl in the bed is [my]_p5692 baby. ""No, she's not. But [he]_p5693 supposed [she]_p5695 was and [he]_p5694 took a step towards the sleeping child with [his]_p5696 dagger upraised. Of course [he]_p5697 did not strike. [He]_p5698 sat down on the floor instead and sobbed and [Wendy]_n2138 did not know how to comfort him, though [she]_p5699 could have done [it]_p5700 so easily once.",2,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p5701 was only a woman now, and [she]_p5702 ran out of the room to try to think. [Peter]_n2139 continued to cry, and soon [his]_p5703 sobs woke [Jane]_n2140. [She]_p5704 sat up in bed, and was interested at once. ""[Boy]_n2141 ,"". [she]_p5705 said,. ""why are [you]_p5706 crying? [Peter]_n2142 rose and bowed to her, and [she]_p5707 bowed to [him]_p5708 from the bed. ""[Hullo]_n2143 ,"". [he]_p5709 said. ""[Hullo]_n2144 ,"". said [Jane]_n2145.",7,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[My]_p5710 name is [Peter Pan]_n2146 ,"". [he]_p5711 told her. ""Yes, [I]_p5712 know. ""[I]_p5713 came back for [my]_p5714 mother,"". [he]_p5715 explained,. ""to take [her]_p5716 to the [Neverland]_n2147. ""Yes, [I]_p5717 know,"". [Jane]_n2148 said,. ""[I]_p5718 have been waiting for you. When [Wendy]_n2149 returned diffidently [she]_p5719 found [Peter]_n2150 sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously, while [Jane]_n2151 in [her]_p5720 nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy.",6,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[She]_p5721 is [my]_p5722 mother,"". [Peter]_n2152 explained and [Jane]_n2153 descended and stood by [his]_p5723 side, with the look in [her]_p5724 face that [he]_p5725 liked to see on ladies when [they]_p5726 gazed at him. ""[He]_p5727 does so need a mother,"". [Jane]_n2154 said. ""Yes, [I]_p5728 know,"". [Wendy]_n2155 admitted rather forlornly. ""no one knows [it]_p5729 so well as I. ""Good-bye,"". said [Peter]_n2156 to [Wendy]_n2157 and [he]_p5730 rose in the air, and the shameless [Jane]_n2158 rose with [him]_p5731 [it]_p5732 was already [her]_p5733 easiest way of moving about. [Wendy]_n2159 rushed to the window.",8,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No, no,"". [she]_p5734 cried. ""[It]_p5735 is just for spring cleaning time,"". [Jane]_n2160 said,. ""[he]_p5736 wants [me]_p5737 always to do [his]_p5738 spring cleaning. ""If only [I]_p5739 could go with you,"". [Wendy]_n2161 sighed. ""[You]_p5740 see [you]_p5741 can't fly,"". said [Jane]_n2162. Of course in the end [Wendy]_n2163 let [them]_p5742 fly away together.",4,,9,

As [you]_p5748 look at [Wendy]_n2164 , [you]_p5749 may see [her]_p5750 hair becoming white, and [her]_p5751 figure little again, for all this happened long ago. [Jane]_n2165 is now a common grown-up, with a daughter called [Margaret]_n2166 and every spring cleaning time, except when [he]_p5752 forgets, Peter comes for [Margaret]_n2167 and takes [her]_p5754 to the [Neverland]_n2168 , where [she]_p5755 tells [him]_p5756 stories about himself, to which [he]_p5753 listens eagerly. When [Margaret]_n2169 grows up [she]_p5757 will have a daughter, who is to be [Peter]_n2170 's mother in turn and thus [it]_p5758 will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.",7,,16,
