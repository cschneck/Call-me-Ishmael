barrie_peter_pan,"Chapter 1 [PETER]_n0 BREAKS THROUGH All children, except one, grow up. [They]_p0 soon know that [they]_p1 will grow up, and the way [Wendy]_n1 knew was this. [One]_n2 day when [she]_p2 was two years old [she]_p3 was playing in a garden, and [she]_p3 plucked another flower and ran with [it]_p5 to [her]_p6 mother. [I]_p7 suppose [she]_p8 must have looked rather delightful, for [Mrs Darling]_n3 put [her]_p9 hand to [her]_p10 heart and cried,. ""Oh, why can't [you]_p11 remain like this for ever!"". This was all that passed between [them]_p12 on the subject, but henceforth [Wendy]_n4 knew that [she]_p13 must grow up. [You]_p14 always know after [you]_p15 are two. Two is the beginning of the end. Of course [they]_p16 lived at 14 [their house number on [their]_p17 street], and until [Wendy]_n5 came [her]_p19 mother was the chief one. [She]_p20 was a lovely [lady]_n6 , with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.",7,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," [Her]_p21 romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling [East]_n7 , however many [you]_p22 discover there is always one more and [her]_p23 sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on [it]_p24 that [Wendy]_n8 could never get, though there [it]_p25 was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner. The way [Mr Darling]_n9 won [her]_p26 was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when [she]_p31 was a girl discovered simultaneously that [they]_p32 loved her, and [they]_p33 all ran to [her]_p27 house to propose to [her]_p27 except [Mr Darling]_n10 , who took a cab and nipped in first, and so [he]_p34 got her. [He]_p35 got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. [He]_p36 never knew about the box, and in time [he]_p37 gave up trying for the kiss. [Wendy]_n11 thought [Napoleon]_n12 could have got it, but [I]_p38 can picture [him]_p39 trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door. [Mr Darling]_n13 used to boast to [Wendy]_n14 that [her]_p40 mother not only loved [him]_p41 but respected him. [He]_p43 was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but [he]_p44 quite seemed to know, and [he]_p45 often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him. [Mrs Darling]_n15 was married in white, and at first [she]_p46 kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if [it]_p47 were a game, not so much as a [Brussels]_n16 sprout was missing but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of [them]_p48 there were pictures of babies without faces. [She]_p49 drew [them]_p50 when [she]_p51 should have been totting up.",10,,28,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p52 were [Mrs Darling]_n17 's guesses. [Wendy]_n18 came first, then [John]_n19 , then [Michael]_n20. For a week or two after [Wendy]_n21 came [it]_p53 was doubtful whether [they]_p54 would be able to keep her, as [she]_p55 was another mouth to feed. [Mr Darling]_n22 was frightfully proud of her, but [he]_p58 was very honourable, and [he]_p59 sat on the edge of [Mrs Darling]_n23 's bed, holding [her]_p56 hand and calculating expenses, while [she]_p60 looked at [him]_p61 imploringly. [She]_p62 wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not [his]_p63 way [his]_p64 way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if [she]_p65 confused [him]_p66 with suggestions [he]_p67 had to begin at the beginning again. ""Now don't interrupt,"". [he]_p68 would beg of her. ""I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office [I]_p69 can cut off [my]_p73 coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with [your]_p76 eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in [my]_p74 cheque-book makes eight nine seven, who is that moving?, eight nine seven, dot and carry seven, don't speak, [my]_p74 own, and the pound [you]_p77 lent to that man who came to the door, quiet, child, dot and carry child, there, you've done it!, did [I]_p70 say nine nine seven? yes, [I]_p70 said nine nine seven the question is, can [we]_p81 try [it]_p79 for a year on nine nine seven?. ""Of course [we]_p82 can, [George]_n24 ,"". [she]_p83 cried.",8,,28,
barrie_peter_pan," But [she]_p84 was prejudiced in [Wendy]_n25 's favour, and [he]_p85 was really the grander character of the two. ""Remember mumps,"". [he]_p86 warned [her]_p88 almost threateningly, and off [he]_p87 went again. ""Mumps one pound, that is what [I]_p89 have put down, but [I]_p90 daresay [it]_p91 will be more like thirty shillings, don't speak, measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six, don't waggle [your]_p94 finger, whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings , and so on [it]_p92 went, and [it]_p92 added up differently each time but at last [Wendy]_n26 just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one. There was the same excitement over [John]_n27 , and [Michael]_n28 had even a narrower squeak but both were kept, and soon, [you]_p95 might have seen the three of [them]_p96 going in a row to [Miss Fulsom]_n29 's [Kindergarten]_n30 school, accompanied by [their]_p97 nurse. [Mrs Darling]_n31 loved to have everything just so, and [Mr Darling]_n32 had a passion for being exactly like [his]_p98 neighbours so, of course, [they]_p99 had a nurse. As [they]_p100 were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim [Newfoundland]_n33 dog, called [Nana]_n34 , who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. [She]_p101 had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with [her]_p102 in [Kensington Gardens]_n35 , where [she]_p104 spent most of [her]_p103 spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom [she]_p105 followed to [their]_p106 homes and complained of to [their]_p107 mistresses. [She]_p108 proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough [she]_p109 was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of [her]_p110 charges made the slightest cry.",11,,27,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course [her]_p111 kennel was in the nursery. [She]_p112 had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when [it]_p113 needs stocking around [your]_p114 throat. [She]_p115 believed to [her]_p116 last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. [It]_p117 was a lesson in propriety to see [her]_p118 escorting the children to school, walking sedately by [their]_p119 side when [they]_p120 were well behaved, and butting [them]_p122 back into line if [they]_p121 strayed. On [John]_n36 's footer [in [England]_n37 soccer was called football,. ""footer"". for short] days [she]_p123 never once forgot [his]_p125 sweater, and [she]_p124 usually carried an umbrella in [her]_p126 mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of [Miss Fulsom]_n38 's school where the nurses wait. [They]_p127 sat on forms, while [Nana]_n39 lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. [They]_p128 affected to ignore [her]_p129 as of an inferior social status to themselves, and [she]_p130 despised [their]_p131 light talk.",4,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p132 resented visits to the nursery from [Mrs Darling]_n40 's friends, but if [they]_p133 did come [she]_p134 first whipped off [Michael]_n41 's pinafore and put [him]_p135 into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out [Wendy]_n42 and made a dash at [John]_n43 's hair. No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and [Mr Darling]_n44 knew it, yet [he]_p136 sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked. [He]_p137 had [his]_p138 position in the city to consider. [Nana]_n45 also troubled [him]_p139 in another way. [He]_p140 had sometimes a feeling that [she]_p141 did not admire him. ""I know [she]_p142 admires [you]_p144 tremendously, [George]_n46 , Mrs Darling would assure him, and then [she]_p143 would sign to the children to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, [Liza]_n47 , was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget [she]_p145 looked in [her]_p148 long skirt and maid's cap, though [she]_p146 had sworn, when engaged, that [she]_p146 would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was [Mrs Darling]_n48 , who would pirouette so wildly that all [you]_p149 could see of [her]_p152 was the kiss, and then if [you]_p150 had dashed at [her]_p153 [you]_p150 might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of [Peter Pan]_n49.",10,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mrs Darling]_n50 first heard of [Peter]_n51 when [she]_p154 was tidying up [her]_p155 children's minds. [It]_p156 is the nightly custom of every good mother after [her]_p157 children are [asleep]_n52 to rummage in [their]_p158 minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into [their]_p159 proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. If [you]_p160 could keep awake (but of course [you]_p161 can't) [you]_p161 would see [your]_p164 own mother doing this, and [you]_p162 would find [it]_p165 very interesting to watch her. [It]_p166 is quite like tidying up drawers. [You]_p167 would see [her]_p168 on [her]_p169 knees, [I]_p171 expect, lingering humorously over some of [your]_p172 contents, wondering where on earth [you]_p173 had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to [her]_p169 cheek as if [it]_p174 were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When [you]_p175 wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which [you]_p176 went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of [your]_p178 mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out [your]_p179 prettier thoughts, ready for [you]_p176 to put on. [I]_p180 don't know whether [you]_p181 have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and [your]_p182 own map can become intensely interesting, but catch [them]_p183 trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like [your]_p184 temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the [Neverland]_n53 is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old [lady]_n54 with a hooked nose. [It]_p185 would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out [your]_p186 tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or [they]_p187 are another map showing through, and [it]_p188 is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.",5,,35,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. [John]_n55 's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over [it]_p189 at which [John]_n56 was shooting, while [Michael]_n57 , who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. [John]_n58 lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, [Michael]_n59 in a wigwam, [Wendy]_n60 in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, [Michael]_n61 had friends at night, [Wendy]_n62 had a pet wolf forsaken by [its]_p191 parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if [they]_p192 stood still in a row [you]_p194 could say of [them]_p195 that [they]_p193 have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching [their]_p196 coracles [simple boat]. [We]_p197 too have been there [we]_p198 can still hear the sound of the surf, though [we]_p199 shall land no more. Of all delectable islands the [Neverland]_n63 is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, [you]_p200 know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When [you]_p201 play at [it]_p203 by day with the chairs and table-cloth, [it]_p204 is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before [you]_p202 go to sleep [it]_p204 becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in [her]_p206 travels through [her]_p207 children's minds [Mrs Darling]_n64 found things [she]_p208 could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word [Peter]_n65.",11,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p209 knew of no [Peter]_n66 , and yet [he]_p210 was here and there in [John]_n67 and [Michael]_n68 's minds, while [Wendy]_n69 's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as [Mrs Darling]_n70 gazed [she]_p211 felt that [it]_p212 had an oddly cocky appearance. ""Yes, [he]_p213 is rather cocky,"". [Wendy]_n71 admitted with regret. [Her]_p214 mother had been questioning her. ""But who is he, [my]_p215 pet?. ""He is [Peter Pan]_n72 , [you]_p216 know, mother. At first [Mrs Darling]_n73 did not know, but after thinking back into [her]_p217 childhood [she]_p218 just remembered a [Peter Pan]_n74 who was said to live with the fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died [he]_p219 went part of the way with them, so that [they]_p220 should not be frightened. [She]_p221 had believed in [him]_p222 at the time, but now that [she]_p223 was married and full of sense [she]_p224 quite doubted whether there was any such person.",9,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Besides,"". [she]_p225 said to [Wendy]_n75 ,. ""he would be grown up by this time. ""Oh no, [he]_p226 isn't grown up,"". [Wendy]_n76 assured [her]_p227 confidently,. ""and [he]_p228 is just [my]_p229 size. "". [She]_p230 meant that [he]_p231 was [her]_p232 size in both mind and body [she]_p233 didn't know how [she]_p234 knew, [she]_p234 just knew it. [Mrs Darling]_n77 consulted [Mr Darling]_n78 , but [he]_p236 smiled pooh-pooh. ""Mark [my]_p237 words,"".",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p238 said,. ""it is some nonsense [Nana]_n79 has been putting into [their]_p239 heads just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave [it]_p240 alone, and [it]_p241 will blow over. But [it]_p242 would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave [Mrs Darling]_n80 quite a shock. Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For instance, [they]_p243 may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when [they]_p244 were in the wood [they]_p244 had met [their]_p246 dead father and had a game with him. [It]_p247 was in this casual way that [Wendy]_n81 one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and [Mrs Darling]_n82 was puzzling over [them]_p248 when [Wendy]_n83 said with a tolerant smile:. ""I do believe [it]_p249 is that [Peter]_n84 again!. ""Whatever do [you]_p250 mean, [Wendy]_n85 ?.",7,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""It is so naughty of [him]_p251 not to wipe [his]_p252 feet,"". [Wendy]_n86 said, sighing. [She]_p253 was a tidy child. [She]_p254 explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that [she]_p255 thought [Peter]_n87 sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of [her]_p256 bed and played on [his]_p258 pipes to her. Unfortunately [she]_p259 never woke, so [she]_p260 didn't know how [she]_p260 knew, [she]_p261 just knew. ""What nonsense [you]_p263 talk, precious. No one can get into the house without knocking. ""I think [he]_p264 comes in by the window,"". [she]_p265 said. ""My love, [it]_p266 is three floors up.",2,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?   [It]_p267 was quite true the leaves had been found very near the window. [Mrs Darling]_n88 did not know what to think, for [it]_p268 all seemed so natural to [Wendy]_n89 that [you]_p270 could not dismiss [it]_p269 by saying [she]_p271 had been dreaming. ""My child,"". the mother cried,. ""why did [you]_p272 not tell [me]_p273 of this before?. ""I forgot,"". said [Wendy]_n90 lightly. [She]_p274 was in a hurry to get [her]_p275 breakfast. Oh, surely [she]_p276 must have been dreaming. But, on the other hand, there were the leaves.",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mrs Darling]_n91 examined [them]_p277 very carefully [they]_p278 were skeleton leaves, but [she]_p280 was sure [they]_p279 did not come from any tree that grew in [England]_n92. [She]_p281 crawled about the floor, peering at [it]_p282 with a candle for marks of a strange foot. [She]_p283 rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. [She]_p284 let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and [it]_p285 was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by. Certainly [Wendy]_n93 had been dreaming. But [Wendy]_n94 had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun. On the night [we]_p286 speak of all the children were once more in bed. [It]_p287 happened to be [Nana]_n95 's evening off, and [Mrs Darling]_n96 had bathed [them]_p288 and sung to [them]_p289 till one by one [they]_p290 had let go [her]_p291 hand and slid away into the land of sleep. All were looking so safe and cosy that [she]_p292 smiled at [her]_p293 fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew. [It]_p294 was something for [Michael]_n97 , who on [his]_p295 birthday was getting into shirts.",7,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on [Mrs Darling]_n98 's lap. Then [her]_p296 head nodded, oh, so gracefully. [She]_p297 was [asleep]_n99. Look at the four of them, [Wendy]_n100 and [Michael]_n101 over there, [John]_n102 here, and [Mrs Darling]_n103 by the fire. There should have been a fourth night-light. While [she]_p298 slept [she]_p299 had a dream. [She]_p300 dreamt that the [Neverland]_n104 had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. [He]_p301 did not alarm her, for [she]_p302 thought [she]_p303 had seen [him]_p304 before in the faces of many women who have no children. Perhaps [he]_p305 is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. But in [her]_p306 dream [he]_p307 had rent the film that obscures the [Neverland]_n105 , and [she]_p308 saw [Wendy]_n106 and [John]_n107 and [Michael]_n108 peeping through the gap.",11,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," The dream by [itself]_p309 would have been a trifle, but while [she]_p310 was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. [He]_p311 was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than [your]_p312 fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and [I]_p313 think [it]_p314 must have been this light that wakened [Mrs Darling]_n109. [She]_p315 started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow [she]_p316 knew at once that [he]_p317 was [Peter Pan]_n110. If [you]_p318 or [I]_p319 or [Wendy]_n111 had been there [we]_p320 should have seen that [he]_p321 was very like [Mrs Darling]_n112 's kiss. [He]_p322 was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about [him]_p323 was that [he]_p324 had all [his]_p325 first teeth. When [he]_p326 saw [she]_p328 was a grown-up, [he]_p327 gnashed the little pearls at her. Chapter 2 THE SHADOW [Mrs Darling]_n113 screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and [Nana]_n114 entered, returned from [her]_p329 evening out. [She]_p330 growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again [Mrs Darling]_n115 screamed, this time in distress for him, for [she]_p331 thought [he]_p336 was killed, and [she]_p332 ran down into the street to look for [his]_p337 little body, but [it]_p338 was not there and [she]_p332 looked up, and in the black night [she]_p333 could see nothing but what [she]_p333 thought was a shooting star. [She]_p339 returned to the nursery, and found [Nana]_n116 with something in [her]_p340 mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow.",8,,32,
barrie_peter_pan," As [he]_p341 leapt at the window [Nana]_n117 had closed [it]_p342 quickly, too late to catch him, but [his]_p344 shadow had not had time to get out slam went the window and snapped [it]_p343 off. [You]_p345 may be sure [Mrs Darling]_n118 examined the shadow carefully, but [it]_p346 was quite the ordinary kind. [Nana]_n119 had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. [She]_p347 hung [it]_p348 out at the window, meaning. ""He is sure to come back for [it]_p349 let [us]_p352 put [it]_p350 where [he]_p353 can get [it]_p350 easily without disturbing the children. But unfortunately [Mrs Darling]_n120 could not leave [it]_p354 hanging out at the window, [it]_p355 looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. [She]_p356 thought of showing [it]_p357 to [Mr Darling]_n121 , but [he]_p359 was totting up winter great-coats for [John]_n122 and [Michael]_n123 , with a wet towel around [his]_p361 head to keep [his]_p362 brain clear, and [it]_p358 seemed a shame to trouble [him]_p363 besides, [she]_p364 knew exactly what [he]_p360 would say:. ""It all comes of having a dog for a nurse. [She]_p365 decided to roll the shadow up and put [it]_p366 away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling [her]_p367 husband. Ah me! The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten [Friday]_n124.",8,,27,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course [it]_p368 was a [Friday]_n125. ""I ought to have been specially careful on a [Friday]_n126 ,"". [she]_p369 used to say afterwards to [her]_p370 husband, while perhaps [Nana]_n127 was on the other side of her, holding [her]_p371 hand. ""No, no,"". [Mr Darling]_n128 always said,. ""I am responsible for [it]_p373 all. I, [George Darling]_n129 , did it. [MEA CULPA]_n130 , [MEA CULPA]_n131. "". [He]_p374 had had a classical education.",7,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p375 sat thus night after night recalling that fatal [Friday]_n132 , till every detail of [it]_p376 was stamped on [their]_p377 brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage. ""If only [I]_p378 had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,"". [Mrs Darling]_n133 said. ""If only [I]_p379 had not poured [my]_p380 medicine into [Nana]_n134 's bowl,"". said [Mr Darling]_n135. ""If only [I]_p381 had pretended to like the medicine,"". was what [Nana]_n136 's wet eyes said. ""My liking for parties, [George]_n137. ""My fatal gift of humour, dearest. ""My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.",6,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," Then one or more of [them]_p382 would break down altogether [Nana]_n138 at the thought,. ""It's true, it's true, [they]_p383 ought not to have had a dog for a nurse. "". Many a time [it]_p384 was [Mr Darling]_n139 who put the handkerchief to [Nana]_n140 's eyes. ""That fiend!"". [Mr Darling]_n141 would cry, and [Nana]_n142 's bark was the echo of it, but [Mrs Darling]_n143 never upbraided [Peter]_n144 there was something in the right-hand corner of [her]_p385 mouth that wanted [her]_p386 not to call [Peter]_n145 names. [They]_p387 would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. [It]_p388 had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with [Nana]_n146 putting on the water for [Michael]_n147 's bath and carrying [him]_p389 to [it]_p390 on [her]_p391 back. ""I won't go to bed,"". [he]_p392 had shouted, like one who still believed that [he]_p393 had the last word on the subject,.",10,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I won't, [I]_p394 won't. [Nana]_n148 , [it]_p396 isn't six o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, [I]_p397 shan't love [you]_p398 any more, [Nana]_n149. [I]_p399 tell [you]_p403 [I]_p400 won't be bathed, [I]_p400 won't, [I]_p401 won't! Then [Mrs Darling]_n150 had come in, wearing [her]_p404 white evening-gown. [She]_p405 had dressed early because [Wendy]_n151 so loved to see [her]_p406 in [her]_p407 evening-gown, with the necklace [George]_n152 had given her. [She]_p409 was wearing [Wendy]_n153 's bracelet on [her]_p410 arm [she]_p411 had asked for the loan of it. [Wendy]_n154 loved to lend [her]_p412 bracelet to [her]_p413 mother. [She]_p414 had found [her]_p415 two older children playing at being [herself]_p416 and father on the occasion of [Wendy]_n155 's birth, and [John]_n156 was saying:. ""I am happy to inform you, [Mrs Darling]_n157 , that [you]_p417 are now a mother, in just such a tone as [Mr Darling]_n158 [himself]_p419 may have used on the real occasion. [Wendy]_n159 had danced with joy, just as the real [Mrs Darling]_n160 must have done.",13,,23,
barrie_peter_pan," Then [John]_n161 was born, with the extra pomp that [he]_p420 conceived due to the birth of a male, and [Michael]_n162 came from [his]_p421 bath to ask to be born also, but [John]_n163 said brutally that [they]_p422 did not want any more. [Michael]_n164 had nearly cried. ""Nobody wants me,"". [he]_p423 said, and of course the [lady]_n165 in the evening-dress could not stand that. ""I do,"". [she]_p424 said,. ""I so want a third child. ""[Boy]_n166 or girl?"". asked [Michael]_n167 , not too hopefully. ""[Boy]_n168.",8,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," Then [he]_p425 had leapt into [her]_p426 arms. Such a little thing for Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n169 and [Nana]_n170 to recall now, but not so little if that was to be [Michael]_n171 's last night in the nursery. [They]_p427 go on with [their]_p428 recollections. ""It was then that [I]_p429 rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it?"". [Mr Darling]_n172 would say, scorning [himself]_p430 and indeed [he]_p431 had been like a tornado. Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for the party, and all had gone well with [him]_p432 until [he]_p433 came to [his]_p434 tie. [It]_p435 is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though [he]_p436 knew about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of [his]_p437 tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to [him]_p438 without a contest, but there were occasions when [it]_p439 would have been better for the house if [he]_p440 had swallowed [his]_p441 pride and used a made-up tie. This was such an occasion.",4,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p442 came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in [his]_p443 hand. ""Why, what is the matter, father dear?. ""Matter!"". [he]_p444 yelled [he]_p445 really yelled. ""This tie, [it]_p446 will not tie. "". [He]_p447 became dangerously sarcastic. ""Not round [my]_p448 neck! Round the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have [I]_p450 made [it]_p451 up round the bed-post, but round [my]_p449 neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused! [He]_p452 thought [Mrs Darling]_n173 was not sufficiently impressed, and [he]_p453 went on sternly,. ""I warn [you]_p459 of this, mother, that unless this tie is round [my]_p461 neck [we]_p462 don't go out to dinner [to-night]_n174 , and if [I]_p454 don't go out to dinner [to-night]_n175 , [I]_p455 never go to the office again, and if [I]_p455 don't go to the office again, [you]_p460 and [I]_p456 starve, and [our]_p463 children will be flung into the streets. Even then [Mrs Darling]_n176 was placid.",4,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Let [me]_p464 try, dear,"". [she]_p465 said, and indeed that was what [he]_p467 had come to ask [her]_p468 to do, and with [her]_p469 nice cool hands [she]_p466 tied [his]_p470 tie for him, while the children stood around to see [their]_p471 fate decided. Some men would have resented [her]_p472 being able to do [it]_p474 so easily, but [Mr Darling]_n177 had far too fine a nature for that [he]_p475 thanked [her]_p473 carelessly, at once forgot [his]_p476 rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with [Michael]_n178 on [his]_p477 back. ""How wildly [we]_p478 romped!"". says [Mrs Darling]_n179 now, recalling it. ""Our last romp!"". [Mr Darling]_n180 groaned. ""[O George]_n181 , do [you]_p479 remember [Michael]_n182 suddenly said to me, How did [you]_p480 get to know me, mother?'. ""I remember!. ""They were rather sweet, don't [you]_p481 think, [George]_n183 ?.",7,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," ""And [they]_p482 were ours, ours! and now [they]_p483 are gone. The romp had ended with the appearance of [Nana]_n184 , and most unluckily [Mr Darling]_n185 collided against her, covering [his]_p484 trousers with hairs. [They]_p485 were not only new trousers, but [they]_p486 were the first [he]_p487 had ever had with braid on them, and [he]_p488 had had to bite [his]_p489 lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course [Mrs Darling]_n186 brushed him, but [he]_p490 began to talk again about [its]_p491 being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse. ""[George]_n187 , [Nana]_n188 is a treasure. ""No doubt, but [I]_p492 have an uneasy feeling at times that [she]_p493 looks upon the children as puppies. ""Oh no, dear one, [I]_p494 feel sure [she]_p495 knows [they]_p496 have souls. ""I wonder,"". [Mr Darling]_n189 said thoughtfully,. ""I wonder.",6,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," "". [It]_p497 was an opportunity, [his]_p498 wife felt, for telling [him]_p499 about the boy. At first [he]_p500 pooh-poohed the story, but [he]_p501 became thoughtful when [she]_p502 showed [him]_p503 the shadow. ""It is nobody [I]_p504 know,"". [he]_p505 said, examining [it]_p506 carefully,. ""but [it]_p507 does look a scoundrel. ""We were still discussing it, [you]_p508 remember,"". says [Mr Darling]_n190 ,. ""when [Nana]_n191 came in with [Michael]_n192 's medicine. [You]_p509 will never carry the bottle in [your]_p510 mouth again, [Nana]_n193 , and [it]_p511 is all [my]_p512 fault.",4,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," Strong man though [he]_p513 was, there is no doubt that [he]_p514 had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine. If [he]_p515 had a weakness, [it]_p518 was for thinking that all [his]_p519 life [he]_p516 had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when [Michael]_n194 dodged the spoon in [Nana]_n195 's mouth, [he]_p516 had said reprovingly,. ""Be a man, [Michael]_n196. ""Won't won't!"". [Michael]_n197 cried naughtily. [Mrs Darling]_n198 left the room to get a chocolate for him, and [Mr Darling]_n199 thought this showed want of firmness. ""[Mother]_n200 , don't pamper him,"". [he]_p520 called after her. ""[Michael]_n201 , when [I]_p521 was [your]_p523 age [I]_p522 took medicine without a murmur. [I]_p524 said, Thank you, kind parents, for giving [me]_p525 bottles to make [me]_p526 well.",8,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ' [He]_p527 really thought this was true, and [Wendy]_n202 , who was now in [her]_p528 night-gown, believed [it]_p529 also, and [she]_p530 said, to encourage [Michael]_n203 ,. ""That medicine [you]_p531 sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't it?. ""Ever so much nastier,"". [Mr Darling]_n204 said bravely,. ""and [I]_p532 would take [it]_p534 now as an example to you, [Michael]_n205 , if [I]_p533 hadn't lost the bottle. [He]_p535 had not exactly lost [it]_p536 [he]_p538 had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden [it]_p537 there. What [he]_p539 did not know was that the faithful [Liza]_n206 had found it, and put [it]_p540 back on [his]_p542 wash-stand. ""I know where [it]_p543 is, father,"". [Wendy]_n207 cried, always glad to be of service. ""I'll bring it,"".",6,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," and [she]_p544 was off before [he]_p545 could stop her. Immediately [his]_p546 spirits sank in the strangest way. ""[John]_n208 ,"". [he]_p547 said, shuddering,. ""it's most beastly stuff. It's that nasty, sticky, sweet kind. ""It will soon be over, father,"". [John]_n209 said cheerily, and then in rushed [Wendy]_n210 with the medicine in a glass. ""I have been as quick as [I]_p548 could,"". [she]_p550 panted.",3,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""You have been wonderfully quick,"". [her]_p551 father retorted, with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. ""[Michael]_n211 first,"". [he]_p553 said doggedly. ""[Father]_n212 first,"". said [Michael]_n213 , who was of a suspicious nature. ""I shall be sick, [you]_p554 know,"". [Mr Darling]_n214 said threateningly. ""Come on, father,"". said [John]_n215.",5,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Hold [your]_p555 tongue, [John]_n216 ,"". [his]_p556 father rapped out. [Wendy]_n217 was quite puzzled. ""I thought [you]_p557 took [it]_p558 quite easily, father. ""That is not the point,"". [he]_p559 retorted. ""The point is, that there is more in [my]_p560 glass than in [Michael]_n218 's spoon. "". [His]_p561 proud heart was nearly bursting. ""And [it]_p562 isn't fair: [I]_p566 would say [it]_p563 though [it]_p563 were with [my]_p567 last breath [it]_p564 isn't fair.",3,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Father]_n219 , [I]_p568 am waiting,"". said [Michael]_n220 coldly. ""It's all very well to say [you]_p569 are waiting so am [I]_p570 waiting. ""[Father]_n221 's a cowardly custard. ""So are [you]_p571 a cowardly custard. ""I'm not frightened. ""Neither am [I]_p572 frightened. ""Well, then, take it. ""Well, then, [you]_p573 take it. [Wendy]_n222 had a splendid idea.",4,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Why not both take [it]_p574 at the same time?. ""Certainly,"". said [Mr Darling]_n223. ""Are [you]_p575 ready, [Michael]_n224 ? [Wendy]_n225 gave the words, one, two, three, and [Michael]_n226 took [his]_p576 medicine, but [Mr Darling]_n227 slipped [his]_p577 behind [his]_p577 back. There was a yell of rage from [Michael]_n228 , and. ""O father!"". [Wendy]_n229 exclaimed. ""What do [you]_p579 mean by O father'?"". [Mr Darling]_n230 demanded. ""Stop that row, [Michael]_n231.",9,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [I]_p580 meant to take mine, but I, [I]_p581 missed it. [It]_p583 was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if [they]_p584 did not admire him. ""Look here, all of you,"". [he]_p585 said entreatingly, as soon as [Nana]_n232 had gone into the bathroom. ""I have just thought of a splendid joke. [I]_p586 shall pour [my]_p587 medicine into [Nana]_n233 's bowl, and [she]_p588 will drink it, thinking [it]_p589 is milk! [It]_p591 was the colour of milk but the children did not have [their]_p592 father's sense of humour, and [they]_p593 looked at [him]_p594 reproachfully as [he]_p595 poured the medicine into [Nana]_n234 's bowl. ""What fun!"". [he]_p596 said doubtfully, and [they]_p597 did not dare expose [him]_p598 when [Mrs Darling]_n235 and [Nana]_n236 returned. ""[Nana]_n237 , good dog,"". [he]_p599 said, patting her,.",6,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I have put a little milk into [your]_p600 bowl, [Nana]_n238. [Nana]_n239 wagged [her]_p601 tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then [she]_p602 gave [Mr Darling]_n240 such a look, not an angry look: [she]_p603 showed [him]_p604 the great red tear that makes [us]_p605 so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into [her]_p606 kennel. [Mr Darling]_n241 was frightfully ashamed of himself, but [he]_p607 would not give in. In a horrid silence [Mrs Darling]_n242 smelt the bowl. ""[O George]_n243 ,"". [she]_p608 said,. ""it's [your]_p609 medicine!. ""It was only a joke,"". [he]_p610 roared, while [she]_p611 comforted [her]_p612 boys, and [Wendy]_n244 hugged [Nana]_n245.",8,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Much good,"". [he]_p613 said bitterly,. ""my wearing [myself]_p614 to the bone trying to be funny in this house. And still [Wendy]_n246 hugged [Nana]_n247. ""That's right,"". [he]_p615 shouted. ""Coddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! [I]_p616 am only the breadwinner, why should [I]_p617 be coddled, why, why, why!. ""[George]_n248 ,"". [Mrs Darling]_n249 entreated him,.",4,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""not so loud the servants will hear you. "". Somehow [they]_p618 had got into the way of calling [Liza]_n250 the servants. ""Let them!"". [he]_p619 answered recklessly. ""[Bring]_n251 in the whole world. But [I]_p620 refuse to allow that dog to lord [it]_p621 in [my]_p622 nursery for an hour longer. The children wept, and [Nana]_n252 ran to [him]_p623 beseechingly, but [he]_p624 waved [her]_p625 back. [He]_p626 felt [he]_p627 was a strong man again. ""In vain, in vain,"".",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p628 cried. ""the proper place for [you]_p629 is the yard, and there [you]_p630 go to be tied up this instant. ""[George]_n253 , [George]_n254 ,"". [Mrs Darling]_n255 whispered,. ""remember what [I]_p631 told [you]_p632 about that boy. Alas, [he]_p633 would not listen. [He]_p634 was determined to show who was master in that house, and when commands would not draw [Nana]_n256 from the kennel, [he]_p635 lured [her]_p636 out of [it]_p639 with honeyed words, and seizing [her]_p637 roughly, dragged [her]_p637 from the nursery. [He]_p640 was ashamed of himself, and yet [he]_p641 did it. [It]_p642 was all owing to [his]_p643 too affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When [he]_p644 had tied [her]_p645 up in the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with [his]_p646 knuckles to [his]_p647 eyes.",4,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," In the meantime [Mrs Darling]_n257 had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit [their]_p648 night-lights. [They]_p649 could hear [Nana]_n258 barking, and [John]_n259 whimpered,. ""It is because [he]_p650 is chaining [her]_p651 up in the yard,"". but [Wendy]_n260 was wiser. ""That is not [Nana]_n261 's unhappy bark,"". [she]_p652 said, little guessing what was about to happen. ""that is [her]_p653 bark when [she]_p654 smells danger. Danger!. ""Are [you]_p655 sure, [Wendy]_n262 ?. ""Oh, yes.",6,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mrs Darling]_n263 quivered and went to the window. [It]_p656 was securely fastened. [She]_p657 looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. [They]_p658 were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but [she]_p659 did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at [her]_p660 heart and made [her]_p661 cry,. ""Oh, how [I]_p662 wish that [I]_p663 wasn't going to a party [to-night]_n264 ! Even [Michael]_n265 , already half [asleep]_n266 , knew that [she]_p664 was perturbed, and [he]_p665 asked,. ""Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?. ""Nothing, precious,"". [she]_p666 said. ""they are the eyes a mother leaves behind [her]_p667 to guard [her]_p668 children.",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p669 went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little [Michael]_n267 flung [his]_p670 arms round her. ""[Mother]_n268 ,"". [he]_p671 cried,. ""I'm glad of you. [They]_p672 were the last words [she]_p673 was to hear from [him]_p674 for a long time. No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow, and [Father]_n269 and [Mother Darling]_n270 picked [their]_p675 way over [it]_p677 deftly not to soil [their]_p676 shoes. [They]_p678 were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but [they]_p679 may not take an active part in anything, [they]_p680 must just look on for ever. [It]_p681 is a punishment put on [them]_p682 for something [they]_p683 did so long ago that no star now knows what [it]_p684 was.",4,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little ones still wonder. [They]_p685 are not really friendly to [Peter]_n271 , who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind [them]_p686 and trying to blow [them]_p687 out but [they]_p688 are so fond of fun that [they]_p689 were on [his]_p690 side [to-night]_n272 , and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n273 there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the [Milky Way]_n274 screamed out:. ""Now, [Peter]_n275 ! Chapter 3 [COME]_n276 AWAY, [COME]_n277 AWAY! For a moment after Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n278 left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. [They]_p691 were awfully nice little night-lights, and [one]_p692 cannot help wishing that [they]_p693 could have kept awake to see [Peter]_n279 but [Wendy]_n280 's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before [they]_p694 could close [their]_p695 mouths all the three went out. There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time [we]_p696 have taken to say this, [it]_p697 had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for [Peter]_n281 's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. [It]_p698 was not really a light [it]_p699 made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when [it]_p700 came to rest for a second [you]_p702 saw [it]_p700 was a fairy, no longer than [your]_p703 hand, but still growing. [It]_p704 was a girl called [Tinker Bell]_n282 exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which [her]_p705 figure could be seen to the best advantage. [She]_p706 was slightly inclined to [EMBONPOINT]_n283. [plump hourglass figure] A moment after the fairy's entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars, and [Peter]_n284 dropped in.",14,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p707 had carried [Tinker Bell]_n285 part of the way, and [his]_p708 hand was still messy with the fairy dust. ""[Tinker Bell]_n286 ,"". [he]_p709 called softly, after making sure that the children were [asleep]_n287 ,. ""[Tink]_n288 , where are you?"". [She]_p710 was in a jug for the moment, and liking [it]_p711 extremely [she]_p712 had never been in a jug before. ""Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do [you]_p713 know where [they]_p714 put [my]_p715 shadow?   The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. [It]_p716 is the fairy language. [You]_p717 ordinary children can never hear it, but if [you]_p721 were to hear [it]_p718 [you]_p722 would know that [you]_p722 had heard [it]_p719 once before. [Tink]_n289 said that the shadow was in the big box. [She]_p724 meant the chest of drawers, and [Peter]_n290 jumped at the drawers, scattering [their]_p725 contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha'pence to the crowd.",6,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," In a moment [he]_p726 had recovered [his]_p729 shadow, and in [his]_p730 delight [he]_p727 forgot that [he]_p727 had shut [Tinker Bell]_n291 up in the drawer. If [he]_p731 thought at all, but [I]_p735 don't believe [he]_p732 ever thought, [it]_p736 was that [he]_p732 and [his]_p737 shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water, and when [they]_p738 did not [he]_p733 was appalled. [He]_p739 tried to stick [it]_p740 on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through [Peter]_n292 , and [he]_p741 sat on the floor and cried. [His]_p742 sobs woke [Wendy]_n293 , and [she]_p743 sat up in bed. [She]_p744 was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor [she]_p745 was only pleasantly interested. ""[Boy]_n294 ,"". [she]_p746 said courteously,. ""why are [you]_p747 crying? [Peter]_n295 could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies, and [he]_p748 rose and bowed to [her]_p749 beautifully. [She]_p750 was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to [him]_p751 from the bed.",5,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," ""What's [your]_p752 name?"". [he]_p753 asked. ""[Wendy Moira Angela Darling]_n296 ,"". [she]_p754 replied with some satisfaction. ""What is [your]_p755 name?. ""[Peter Pan]_n297. [She]_p756 was already sure that [he]_p757 must be [Peter]_n298 , but [it]_p758 did seem a comparatively short name. ""Is that all?. ""Yes,"". [he]_p759 said rather sharply.",3,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p760 felt for the first time that [it]_p761 was a shortish name. ""I'm so sorry,"". said [Wendy Moira Angela]_n299. ""It doesn't matter,"". [Peter]_n300 gulped. [She]_p762 asked where [he]_p763 lived. ""Second to the right,"". said [Peter]_n301 ,. ""and then straight on till morning. ""What a funny address! [Peter]_n302 had a sinking.",4,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," For the first time [he]_p764 felt that perhaps [it]_p765 was a funny address. ""No, [it]_p766 isn't,"". [he]_p767 said. ""I mean,"". [Wendy]_n303 said nicely, remembering that [she]_p768 was hostess,. ""is that what [they]_p769 put on the letters?   [He]_p770 wished [she]_p771 had not mentioned letters. ""Don't get any letters,"". [he]_p772 said contemptuously. ""But [your]_p773 mother gets letters?. ""Don't have a mother,"".",1,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p774 said. Not only had [he]_p775 no mother, but [he]_p776 had not the slightest desire to have one. [He]_p777 thought [them]_p778 very over-rated persons. [Wendy]_n304 , however, felt at once that [she]_p779 was in the presence of a tragedy. ""[O Peter]_n305 , no wonder [you]_p780 were crying,"". [she]_p781 said, and got out of bed and ran to him. ""I wasn't crying about mothers,"". [he]_p782 said rather indignantly. ""I was crying because [I]_p783 can't get [my]_p785 shadow to stick on. Besides, [I]_p786 wasn't crying.",2,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""It has come off?. ""Yes. Then [Wendy]_n306 saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and [she]_p787 was frightfully sorry for [Peter]_n307. ""How awful!"". [she]_p788 said, but [she]_p789 could not help smiling when [she]_p789 saw that [he]_p791 had been trying to stick [it]_p792 on with soap. How exactly like a boy!  Fortunately [she]_p793 knew at once what to do. ""It must be sewn on,"". [she]_p794 said, just a little patronisingly. ""What's sewn?"". [he]_p795 asked.",2,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""You're dreadfully ignorant. ""No, I'm not. But [she]_p796 was exulting in [his]_p797 ignorance. ""I shall sew [it]_p798 on for you, [my]_p799 little man,"". [she]_p800 said, though [he]_p802 was tall as herself, and [she]_p801 got out [her]_p803 housewife [sewing bag], and sewed the shadow on to [Peter]_n308 's foot. ""I daresay [it]_p804 will hurt a little,"". [she]_p805 warned him. ""Oh, [I]_p806 shan't cry,"". said [Peter]_n309 , who was already of the opinion that [he]_p807 had never cried in [his]_p808 life. And [he]_p809 clenched [his]_p810 teeth and did not cry, and soon [his]_p811 shadow was behaving properly, though still a little creased.",2,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Perhaps [I]_p812 should have ironed it,"". [Wendy]_n310 said thoughtfully, but [Peter]_n311 , [boylike]_n312 , was indifferent to appearances, and [he]_p813 was now jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, [he]_p814 had already forgotten that [he]_p815 owed [his]_p816 bliss to [Wendy]_n313. [He]_p817 thought [he]_p818 had attached the shadow himself. ""How clever [I]_p819 am!"". [he]_p820 crowed rapturously,. ""oh, the cleverness of me! [It]_p821 is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of [Peter]_n314 was one of [his]_p822 most fascinating qualities. To put [it]_p823 with brutal frankness, there never was a cockier boy. But for the moment [Wendy]_n315 was shocked. ""You conceit [braggart],"".",6,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p824 exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm. ""of course [I]_p825 did nothing!. ""You did a little,"". [Peter]_n316 said carelessly, and continued to dance. ""A little!"". [she]_p826 replied with hauteur [pride]. ""if [I]_p827 am no use [I]_p828 can at least withdraw,"". and [she]_p829 sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered [her]_p830 face with the blankets. To induce [her]_p831 to look up [he]_p833 pretended to be going away, and when this failed [he]_p834 sat on the end of the bed and tapped [her]_p832 gently with [his]_p835 foot. ""[Wendy]_n317 ,"".",2,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p836 said,. ""don't withdraw. [I]_p837 can't help crowing, [Wendy]_n318 , when I'm pleased with myself. "". Still [she]_p839 would not look up, though [she]_p840 was listening eagerly. ""[Wendy]_n319 ,"". [he]_p841 continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist,. ""[Wendy]_n320 , one girl is more use than twenty boys. Now [Wendy]_n321 was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, and [she]_p842 peeped out of the bed-clothes. ""Do [you]_p843 really think so, [Peter]_n322 ?.",5,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes, [I]_p844 do. ""I think it's perfectly sweet of you,"". [she]_p845 declared,. ""and I'll get up again,"". and [she]_p846 sat with [him]_p847 on the side of the bed. [She]_p848 also said [she]_p849 would give [him]_p851 a kiss if [he]_p852 liked, but [Peter]_n323 did not know what [she]_p850 meant, and [he]_p853 held out [his]_p854 hand expectantly. ""Surely [you]_p855 know what a kiss is?"". [she]_p856 asked, aghast. ""I shall know when [you]_p857 give [it]_p858 to me,"". [he]_p859 replied stiffly, and not to hurt [his]_p860 feeling [she]_p861 gave [him]_p862 a thimble.",1,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Now,"". said he,. ""shall [I]_p863 give [you]_p864 a kiss?"". and [she]_p865 replied with a slight primness,. ""If [you]_p866 please. "". [She]_p867 made [herself]_p868 rather cheap by inclining [her]_p869 face toward him, but [he]_p873 merely dropped an acorn button into [her]_p870 hand, so [she]_p874 slowly returned [her]_p870 face to where [it]_p876 had been before, and said nicely that [she]_p875 would wear [his]_p877 kiss on the chain around [her]_p871 neck. [It]_p878 was lucky that [she]_p879 did put [it]_p880 on that chain, for [it]_p881 was afterwards to save [her]_p882 life. When people in [our]_p883 set are introduced, [it]_p884 is customary for [them]_p885 to ask each other's age, and so [Wendy]_n324 , who always liked to do the correct thing, asked [Peter]_n325 how old [he]_p886 was. [It]_p887 was not really a happy question to ask [him]_p888 [it]_p889 was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what [you]_p890 want to be asked is Kings of [England]_n326.",3,,28,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I don't know,"". [he]_p891 replied uneasily,. ""but [I]_p892 am quite young. "". [He]_p893 really knew nothing about it, [he]_p894 had merely suspicions, but [he]_p895 said at a venture,. ""[Wendy]_n327 , [I]_p896 ran away the day [I]_p897 was born. [Wendy]_n328 was quite surprised, but interested and [she]_p898 indicated in the charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on [her]_p899 night-gown, that [he]_p901 could sit nearer her. ""It was because [I]_p902 heard father and mother,"". [he]_p903 explained in a low voice,. ""talking about what [I]_p904 was to be when [I]_p905 became a man.",2,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," "". [He]_p906 was extraordinarily agitated now. ""I don't want ever to be a man,"". [he]_p907 said with passion. ""I want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So [I]_p908 ran away to [Kensington Gardens]_n329 and lived a long long time among the fairies. [She]_p909 gave [him]_p910 a look of the most intense admiration, and [he]_p911 thought [it]_p914 was because [he]_p912 had run away, but [it]_p915 was really because [he]_p912 knew fairies. [Wendy]_n330 had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck [her]_p916 as quite delightful. [She]_p917 poured out questions about them, to [his]_p920 surprise, for [they]_p922 were rather a nuisance to him, getting in [his]_p921 way and so on, and indeed [he]_p923 sometimes had to give [them]_p918 a hiding [spanking]. Still, [he]_p924 liked [them]_p926 on the whole, and [he]_p925 told [her]_p927 about the beginning of fairies.",2,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," ""You see, [Wendy]_n331 , when the first baby laughed for the first time, [its]_p928 laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and [they]_p929 all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies. Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home [she]_p930 liked it. ""And so,"". [he]_p931 went on good-naturedly,. ""there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl. ""Ought to be? Isn't there?. ""No. [You]_p932 see children know such a lot now, [they]_p933 soon don't believe in fairies, and every time a child says, [I]_p934 don't believe in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead. Really, [he]_p935 thought [they]_p936 had now talked enough about fairies, and [it]_p937 struck [him]_p938 that [Tinker Bell]_n332 was keeping very quiet. ""I can't think where [she]_p939 has gone to,"".",2,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p940 said, rising, and [he]_p941 called [Tink]_n333 by name. [Wendy]_n334 's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill. ""[Peter]_n335 ,"". [she]_p942 cried, clutching him,. ""you don't mean to tell [me]_p943 that there is a fairy in this room!. ""She was here just now,"". [he]_p944 said a little impatiently. ""You don't hear her, do you?"". and [they]_p945 both listened. ""The only sound [I]_p946 hear,"".",3,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Wendy]_n336 ,. ""is like a tinkle of bells. ""Well, that's [Tink]_n337 , that's the fairy language. [I]_p947 think [I]_p948 hear [her]_p949 too. The sound came from the chest of drawers, and [Peter]_n338 made a merry face. No one could ever look quite so merry as [Peter]_n339 , and the loveliest of gurgles was [his]_p950 laugh. [He]_p951 had [his]_p952 first laugh still. ""[Wendy]_n340 ,"". [he]_p953 whispered gleefully,. ""I do believe [I]_p954 shut [her]_p956 up in the drawer!

barrie_peter_pan," ""You shouldn't say such things,"". [Peter]_n342 retorted. ""Of course I'm very sorry, but how could [I]_p959 know [you]_p961 were in the drawer? [Wendy]_n343 was not listening to him. ""[O Peter]_n344 ,"". [she]_p962 cried,. ""if [she]_p963 would only stand still and let [me]_p964 see her!. ""They hardly ever stand still,"". [he]_p965 said, but for one moment [Wendy]_n345 saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. ""O the lovely!

barrie_peter_pan," and disappeared into the bathroom. ""She is quite a common fairy,"". [Peter]_n356 explained apologetically,.

barrie_peter_pan," This seemed to [Wendy]_n367 rather forward for a first meeting, and [she]_p999 told [him]_p1000 with spirit that [he]_p1001 was not captain in [her]_p1002 house. However, [John]_n368 continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that [she]_p1003 allowed [him]_p1004 to remain there. ""And [I]_p1005 know [you]_p1006 meant to be kind,"". [she]_p1007 said, relenting,. ""so [you]_p1008 may give [me]_p1009 a kiss. For the moment [she]_p1010 had forgotten [his]_p1011 ignorance about kisses.

barrie_peter_pan," "". [Peter]_n380 could not understand why, but [Wendy]_n381 understood, and [she]_p1031 was just slightly disappointed when [he]_p1032 admitted that [he]_p1033 came to the nursery window not to see [her]_p1034 but to listen to stories. ""You see, [I]_p1035 don't know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any stories. ""How perfectly awful,"". [Wendy]_n382 said. ""Do [you]_p1036 know,"". [Peter]_n383 asked.

""To tell the other boys. ""Don't go [Peter]_n390 ,"".",6,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p1046 entreated,. ""I know such lots of stories. Those were [her]_p1047 precise words, so there can be no denying that [it]_p1048 was [she]_p1049 who first tempted him.

barrie_peter_pan," But [he]_p1077 had no pity for her. ""[Wendy]_n399 ,"". [he]_p1078 said, the sly one,. ""you could tuck [us]_p1079 in at night. ""Oo!.

barrie_peter_pan," [Nana]_n410 , who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. [It]_p1100 was [her]_p1101 silence [they]_p1102 had heard. ""Out with the light! [Hide]_n411 ! [Quick]_n412 !"". cried [John]_n413 , taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when [Liza]_n414 entered, holding [Nana]_n415 , the nursery seemed quite [its]_p1103 old self, very dark, and [you]_p1105 would have sworn [you]_p1106 heard [its]_p1104 three wicked inmates breathing angelically as [they]_p1107 slept. [They]_p1108 were really doing [it]_p1109 artfully from behind the window curtains. [Liza]_n416 was in a bad temper, for [she]_p1110 was mixing the [Christmas]_n417 puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on [her]_p1111 cheek, by [Nana]_n418 's absurd suspicions. [She]_p1112 thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take [Nana]_n419 to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course. ""There, [you]_p1113 suspicious brute,"". [she]_p1114 said, not sorry that [Nana]_n420 was in disgrace.",11,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," ""They are perfectly safe, aren't they? Every one of the little angels sound [asleep]_n421 in bed. [Listen]_n422 to [their]_p1115 gentle breathing. Here [Michael]_n423 , encouraged by [his]_p1116 success, breathed so loudly that [they]_p1117 were nearly detected. [Nana]_n424 knew that kind of breathing, and [she]_p1118 tried to drag [herself]_p1119 out of [Liza]_n425 's clutches. But [Liza]_n426 was dense. ""No more of it, [Nana]_n427 ,"". [she]_p1120 said sternly, pulling [her]_p1121 out of the room. ""I warn [you]_p1124 if [you]_p1125 bark again [I]_p1122 shall go straight for master and missus and bring [them]_p1127 home from the party, and then, oh, won't master whip you, just. [She]_p1128 tied the unhappy dog up again, but do [you]_p1129 think [Nana]_n428 ceased to bark? [Bring]_n429 master and missus home from the party! Why, that was just what [she]_p1130 wanted. Do [you]_p1131 think [she]_p1132 cared whether [she]_p1133 was whipped so long as [her]_p1135 charges were safe? Unfortunately [Liza]_n430 returned to [her]_p1136 puddings, and [Nana]_n431 , seeing that no help would come from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last [she]_p1133 broke it.",11,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," In another moment [she]_p1138 had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up [her]_p1139 paws to heaven, [her]_p1140 most expressive way of making a communication. Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n432 knew at once that something terrible was happening in [their]_p1141 nursery, and without a good-bye to [their]_p1142 hostess [they]_p1143 rushed into the street. But [it]_p1144 was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains, and [Peter Pan]_n433 can do a great deal in ten minutes. [We]_p1145 now return to the nursery. ""It's all right,"". [John]_n434 announced, emerging from [his]_p1146 hiding-place. ""I say, [Peter]_n435 , can [you]_p1147 really fly? Instead of troubling to answer [him]_p1148 [Peter]_n436 flew around the room, taking the mantelpiece on the way. ""How topping!"". said [John]_n437 and [Michael]_n438. ""How sweet!"".",7,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," cried [Wendy]_n439. ""Yes, I'm sweet, oh, [I]_p1149 am sweet!"". said [Peter]_n440 , forgetting [his]_p1151 manners again. [It]_p1152 looked delightfully easy, and [they]_p1153 tried [it]_p1155 first from the floor and then from the beds, but [they]_p1154 always went down instead of up. ""I say, how do [you]_p1156 do it?"". asked [John]_n441 , rubbing [his]_p1157 knee. [He]_p1158 was quite a practical boy. ""You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,"". [Peter]_n442 explained,.

Not one of [them]_p1169 could fly an inch, though even [Michael]_n447 was in words of two syllables, and [Peter]_n448 did not know A from Z. Of course [Peter]_n449 had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as [we]_p1170 have mentioned, one of [his]_p1171 hands was messy with it, and [he]_p1172 blew some on each of them, with the most superb results. ""Now just wiggle [your]_p1173 shoulders this way,"".",7,,13,

[Peter]_n454 gave [Wendy]_n455 a hand at first, but had to desist, [Tink]_n456 was so indignant. Up and down [they]_p1184 went, and round and round. Heavenly was [Wendy]_n457 's word. ""I say,"". cried [John]_n458 ,. ""why shouldn't [we]_p1185 all go out? Of course [it]_p1186 was to this that [Peter]_n459 had been luring them. [Michael]_n460 was ready: [he]_p1187 wanted to see how long [it]_p1188 took [him]_p1189 to do a billion miles. But [Wendy]_n461 hesitated.",9,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Mermaids!"". said [Peter]_n462 again. ""Oo!. ""And there are pirates. ""Pirates,"". cried [John]_n463 , seizing [his]_p1190 [Sunday]_n464 hat,. ""let [us]_p1191 go at once. [It]_p1192 was just at this moment that Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n465 hurried with [Nana]_n466 out of 27. [They]_p1193 ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window and, yes, [it]_p1194 was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, [they]_p1195 could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the floor but in the air. Not three figures, four!  In a tremble [they]_p1196 opened the street door.",5,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mr Darling]_n467 would have rushed upstairs, but [Mrs Darling]_n468 signed [him]_p1197 to go softly. [She]_p1198 even tried to make [her]_p1199 heart go softly. Will [they]_p1200 reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and [we]_p1201 shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On the other hand, if [they]_p1202 are not in time, [I]_p1203 solemnly promise that [it]_p1204 will all come right in the end. [They]_p1205 would have reached the nursery in time had [it]_p1206 not been that the little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window open, and that smallest star of all called out:. ""[Cave]_n469 , [Peter]_n470 ! Then [Peter]_n471 knew that there was not a moment to lose. ""Come,"". [he]_p1207 cried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by [John]_n472 and [Michael]_n473 and [Wendy]_n474. Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n475 and [Nana]_n476 rushed into the nursery too late.",10,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," The birds were flown. Chapter 4 THE FLIGHT. ""Second to the right, and straight on till morning. That, Peter had told [Wendy]_n477 , was the way to the [Neverland]_n478 but even birds, carrying maps and consulting [them]_p1208 at windy corners, could not have sighted [it]_p1209 with these instructions. [Peter]_n479 , [you]_p1210 see, just said anything that came into [his]_p1211 head. At first [his]_p1212 companions trusted [him]_p1213 implicitly, and so great were the delights of flying that [they]_p1214 wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took [their]_p1215 fancy. [John]_n480 and [Michael]_n481 raced, [Michael]_n482 getting a start. [They]_p1216 recalled with contempt that not so long ago [they]_p1217 had thought [themselves]_p1218 fine fellows for being able to fly round a room. Not long ago. But how long ago? [They]_p1219 were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb [Wendy]_n483 seriously.",7,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [John]_n484 thought [it]_p1220 was [their]_p1221 second sea and [their]_p1222 third night. Sometimes [it]_p1223 was dark and sometimes light, and now [they]_p1224 were very cold and again too warm. Did [they]_p1225 really feel hungry at times, or were [they]_p1226 merely pretending, because [Peter]_n485 had such a jolly new way of feeding them? [His]_p1230 way was to pursue birds who had food in [their]_p1231 mouths suitable for humans and snatch [it]_p1232 from [them]_p1228 then the birds would follow and snatch [it]_p1233 back and [they]_p1226 would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But [Wendy]_n486 noticed with gentle concern that [Peter]_n487 did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting [your]_p1234 bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways. Certainly [they]_p1235 did not pretend to be sleepy, [they]_p1236 were sleepy and that was a danger, for the moment [they]_p1236 popped off, down [they]_p1237 fell. The awful thing was that [Peter]_n488 thought this funny. ""There [he]_p1239 goes again!"". [he]_p1240 would cry gleefully, as [Michael]_n489 suddenly dropped like a stone. ""Save him, save him!"". cried [Wendy]_n490 , looking with horror at the cruel sea far below.",7,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," Eventually [Peter]_n491 would dive through the air, and catch [Michael]_n492 just before [he]_p1241 could strike the sea, and [it]_p1244 was lovely the way [he]_p1242 did [it]_p1245 but [he]_p1242 always waited till the last moment, and [you]_p1247 felt [it]_p1245 was [his]_p1248 cleverness that interested [him]_p1249 and not the saving of human life. Also [he]_p1250 was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed [him]_p1252 one moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility that the next time [you]_p1254 fell [he]_p1251 would let [you]_p1255 go. [He]_p1256 could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on [his]_p1257 back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because [he]_p1258 was so light that if [you]_p1260 got behind [him]_p1261 and blew [he]_p1259 went faster. ""Do be more polite to him,"". [Wendy]_n493 whispered to [John]_n494 , when [they]_p1262 were playing. ""Follow [my]_p1263 [Leader]_n495. ""Then tell [him]_p1264 to stop showing off,"". said [John]_n496. When playing Follow [my]_p1265 [Leader]_n497 , [Peter]_n498 would fly close to the water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street [you]_p1266 may run [your]_p1267 finger along an iron railing. [They]_p1268 could not follow [him]_p1269 in this with much success, so perhaps [it]_p1270 was rather like showing off, especially as [he]_p1271 kept looking behind to see how many tails [they]_p1272 missed.",8,,31,
barrie_peter_pan," ""You must be nice to him,"". [Wendy]_n499 impressed on [her]_p1273 brothers. ""What could [we]_p1274 do if [he]_p1275 were to leave us!. ""We could go back,"". [Michael]_n500 said. ""How could [we]_p1276 ever find [our]_p1277 way back without him?. ""Well, then, [we]_p1278 could go on,"". said [John]_n501. ""That is the awful thing, [John]_n502. [We]_p1279 should have to go on, for [we]_p1280 don't know how to stop.",4,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," This was true, [Peter]_n503 had forgotten to show [them]_p1281 how to stop. [John]_n504 said that if the worst came to the worst, all [they]_p1282 had to do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time [they]_p1283 must come back to [their]_p1284 own window. ""And who is to get food for us, [John]_n505 ?. ""I nipped a bit out of that eagle's mouth pretty neatly, [Wendy]_n506. ""After the twentieth try,"". [Wendy]_n507 reminded him. ""And even though [we]_p1285 became good at picking up food, see how [we]_p1286 bump against clouds and things if [he]_p1287 is not near to give [us]_p1288 a hand. Indeed [they]_p1289 were constantly bumping. [They]_p1290 could now fly strongly, though [they]_p1291 still kicked far too much but if [they]_p1292 saw a cloud in front of them, the more [they]_p1292 tried to avoid it, the more certainly did [they]_p1293 bump into it. If [Nana]_n508 had been with them, [she]_p1295 would have had a bandage round [Michael]_n509 's forehead by this time.",7,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n510 was not with [them]_p1296 for the moment, and [they]_p1297 felt rather lonely up there by themselves. [He]_p1298 could go so much faster than [they]_p1299 that [he]_p1301 would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which [they]_p1300 had no share. [He]_p1302 would come down laughing over something fearfully funny [he]_p1303 had been saying to a star, but [he]_p1304 had already forgotten what [it]_p1306 was, or [he]_p1304 would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening. [It]_p1307 was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid. ""And if [he]_p1308 forgets [them]_p1309 so quickly,"". [Wendy]_n511 argued,. ""how can [we]_p1310 expect that [he]_p1311 will go on remembering us?   Indeed, sometimes when [he]_p1312 returned [he]_p1312 did not remember them, at least not well. [Wendy]_n512 was sure of it. [She]_p1314 saw recognition come into [his]_p1315 eyes as [he]_p1316 was about to pass [them]_p1317 the time of day and go on once even [she]_p1318 had to call [him]_p1319 by name. ""I'm [Wendy]_n513 ,"".",4,,24,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p1320 said agitatedly. [He]_p1321 was very sorry. ""I say, [Wendy]_n514 ,"". [he]_p1322 whispered to her,. ""always if [you]_p1323 see [me]_p1325 forgetting you, just keep on saying I'm [Wendy]_n515 ,' and then I'll remember. Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends [he]_p1326 showed [them]_p1327 how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going [their]_p1328 way, and this was such a pleasant change that [they]_p1329 tried [it]_p1331 several times and found that [they]_p1330 could sleep thus with security. Indeed [they]_p1332 would have slept longer, but [Peter]_n516 tired quickly of sleeping, and soon [he]_p1333 would cry in [his]_p1334 captain voice,. ""We get off here. "".",3,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, [they]_p1335 drew near the [Neverland]_n517 for after many moons [they]_p1336 did reach it, and, what is more, [they]_p1336 had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or [Tink]_n518 as because the island was looking for them. [It]_p1338 is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores. ""There [it]_p1339 is,"". said [Peter]_n519 calmly. ""Where, where?. ""Where all the arrows are pointing. Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing [it]_p1340 out to the children, all directed by [their]_p1341 friend the sun, who wanted [them]_p1343 to be sure of [their]_p1342 way before leaving [them]_p1344 for the night. [Wendy]_n520 and [John]_n521 and [Michael]_n522 stood on tip-toe in the air to get [their]_p1345 first sight of the island. Strange to say, [they]_p1346 all recognized [it]_p1349 at once, and until fear fell upon [them]_p1351 [they]_p1347 hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom [they]_p1347 were returning home for the holidays. ""[John]_n523 , there's the lagoon.",7,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Wendy]_n524 , look at the turtles burying [their]_p1352 eggs in the sand. ""I say, [John]_n525 , [I]_p1353 see [your]_p1355 flamingo with the broken leg!. ""Look, [Michael]_n526 , there's [your]_p1356 cave!. ""[John]_n527 , what's that in the brushwood?. ""It's a wolf with [her]_p1357 whelps. [Wendy]_n528 , [I]_p1358 do believe that's [your]_p1359 little whelp!. ""There's [my]_p1360 boat, [John]_n529 , with [her]_p1361 sides stove in!. ""No, [it]_p1362 isn't. Why, [we]_p1363 burned [your]_p1364 boat. ""That's her, at any rate.",6,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [I]_p1365 say, [John]_n530 , [I]_p1366 see the smoke of the redskin camp!. ""Where? Show me, and I'll tell [you]_p1367 by the way smoke curls whether [they]_p1368 are on the war-path. ""There, just across the [Mysterious River]_n531. ""I see now. Yes, [they]_p1369 are on the war-path right enough. [Peter]_n532 was a little annoyed with [them]_p1370 for knowing so much, but if [he]_p1373 wanted to lord [it]_p1374 over [them]_p1371 [his]_p1375 triumph was at hand, for have [I]_p1376 not told [you]_p1377 that anon fear fell upon them? [It]_p1378 came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom. In the old days at home the [Neverland]_n533 had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in [it]_p1379 and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, [you]_p1380 lost the certainty that [you]_p1381 would win. [You]_p1382 were quite glad that the night-lights were on. [You]_p1383 even liked [Nana]_n534 to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the [Neverland]_n535 was all make-believe.",6,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course the [Neverland]_n536 had been make-believe in those days, but [it]_p1384 was real now, and there were no night-lights, and [it]_p1385 was getting darker every moment, and where was [Nana]_n537 ? [They]_p1386 had been flying apart, but [they]_p1387 huddled close to Peter now. [His]_p1388 careless manner had gone at last, [his]_p1389 eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through [them]_p1391 every time [they]_p1392 touched [his]_p1390 body. [They]_p1393 were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed [their]_p1394 feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet [their]_p1395 progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if [they]_p1397 were pushing [their]_p1396 way through hostile forces. Sometimes [they]_p1398 hung in the air until [Peter]_n538 had beaten on [it]_p1399 with [his]_p1400 fists. ""They don't want [us]_p1401 to land,"". [he]_p1402 explained. ""Who are they?"". [Wendy]_n539 whispered, shuddering. But [he]_p1403 could not or would not say.",4,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," [Tinker Bell]_n540 had been [asleep]_n541 on [his]_p1404 shoulder, but now [he]_p1405 wakened [her]_p1406 and sent [her]_p1407 on in front. Sometimes [he]_p1408 poised [himself]_p1410 in the air, listening intently, with [his]_p1411 hand to [his]_p1412 ear, and again [he]_p1409 would stare down with eyes so bright that [they]_p1413 seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, [he]_p1414 went on again. [His]_p1415 courage was almost appalling. ""Would [you]_p1416 like an adventure now,"". [he]_p1417 said casually to [John]_n542 ,. ""or would [you]_p1418 like to have [your]_p1419 tea first? [Wendy]_n543 said. ""tea first"". quickly, and [Michael]_n544 pressed [her]_p1420 hand in gratitude, but the braver [John]_n545 hesitated. ""What kind of adventure?"".",6,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p1421 asked cautiously. ""There's a pirate [asleep]_n546 in the pampas just beneath us,"". [Peter]_n547 told him. ""If [you]_p1422 like, we'll go down and kill him. ""I don't see him,"". [John]_n548 said after a long pause. ""I do. ""Suppose,"". [John]_n549 said, a little huskily,. ""he were to wake up.",4,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n550 spoke indignantly. ""You don't think [I]_p1423 would kill [him]_p1425 while [he]_p1428 was sleeping! [I]_p1424 would wake [him]_p1426 first, and then kill him. That's the way [I]_p1429 always do. ""I say! Do [you]_p1430 kill many?. ""Tons. [John]_n551 said. ""How ripping,"". but decided to have tea first. [He]_p1431 asked if there were many pirates on the island just now, and [Peter]_n552 said [he]_p1432 had never known so many. ""Who is captain now?.",3,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Hook]_n553 ,"". answered [Peter]_n554 , and [his]_p1433 face became very stern as [he]_p1434 said that hated word. ""[Jas]_n555. [Hook]_n556 ?. ""Ay. Then indeed [Michael]_n557 began to cry, and even [John]_n558 could speak in gulps only, for [they]_p1435 knew [Hook]_n559 's reputation. ""He was [Blackbeard]_n560 's bo'sun,"". [John]_n561 whispered huskily. ""He is the worst of [them]_p1436 all. [He]_p1437 is the only man of whom [Barbecue]_n562 was afraid.",10,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""That's him,"". said [Peter]_n563. ""What is [he]_p1438 like? Is [he]_p1439 big?. ""He is not so big as [he]_p1440 was. ""How do [you]_p1441 mean?. ""I cut off a bit of him. ""You!. ""Yes, me,"". said [Peter]_n564 sharply. ""I wasn't meaning to be disrespectful.",2,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Oh, all right. ""But, [I]_p1442 say, what bit?. ""His right hand. ""Then [he]_p1443 can't fight now?. ""Oh, can't [he]_p1444 just!. ""Left-hander?. ""He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and [he]_p1445 claws with it. ""Claws!. ""I say, [John]_n565 ,"". said [Peter]_n566.",2,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes. ""Say, Ay, ay, sir. '. ""Ay, ay, sir. ""There is one thing,"". [Peter]_n567 continued,. ""that every boy who serves under [me]_p1446 has to promise, and so must you. [John]_n568 paled. ""It is this, if [we]_p1447 meet [Hook]_n569 in open fight, [you]_p1448 must leave [him]_p1449 to me. ""I promise,"".",3,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," [John]_n570 said loyally. For the moment [they]_p1450 were feeling less eerie, because [Tink]_n571 was flying with them, and in [her]_p1452 light [they]_p1451 could distinguish each other. Unfortunately [she]_p1453 could not fly so slowly as they, and so [she]_p1454 had to go round and round [them]_p1457 in a circle in which [they]_p1455 moved as in a halo. [Wendy]_n572 quite liked it, until [Peter]_n573 pointed out the drawbacks. ""She tells me,"". [he]_p1458 said,. ""that the pirates sighted [us]_p1459 before the darkness came, and got [Long Tom]_n574 out. ""The big gun?. ""Yes. And of course [they]_p1460 must see [her]_p1463 light, and if [they]_p1461 guess [we]_p1464 are near [it]_p1465 [they]_p1461 are sure to let fly.",5,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Wendy]_n575 !. ""[John]_n576 !. ""[Michael]_n577 !. ""Tell [her]_p1466 to go away at once, [Peter]_n578 ,"". the three cried simultaneously, but [he]_p1467 refused. ""She thinks [we]_p1468 have lost the way,"". [he]_p1469 replied stiffly,. ""and [she]_p1470 is rather frightened. [You]_p1471 don't think [I]_p1472 would send [her]_p1473 away all by [herself]_p1474 when [she]_p1475 is frightened! For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave [Peter]_n579 a loving little pinch. ""Then tell her,"".",5,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [Wendy]_n580 begged,. ""to put out [her]_p1476 light. ""She can't put [it]_p1477 out. That is about the only thing fairies can't do. [It]_p1478 just goes out of [itself]_p1479 when [she]_p1480 falls [asleep]_n581 , same as the stars. ""Then tell [her]_p1481 to sleep at once,"". [John]_n582 almost ordered. ""She can't sleep except when she's sleepy. [It]_p1482 is the only other thing fairies can't do. ""Seems to me,"".",3,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," growled [John]_n583 ,. ""these are the only two things worth doing. Here [he]_p1483 got a pinch, but not a loving one. ""If only one of [us]_p1484 had a pocket,"". [Peter]_n584 said,. ""we could carry [her]_p1485 in it. "". However, [they]_p1486 had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them. [He]_p1487 had a happy idea. [John]_n585 's hat! [Tink]_n586 agreed to travel by hat if [it]_p1488 was carried in the hand.",4,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [John]_n587 carried it, though [she]_p1489 had hoped to be carried by [Peter]_n588. Presently [Wendy]_n589 took the hat, because [John]_n590 said [it]_p1490 struck against [his]_p1491 knee as [he]_p1492 flew and this, as [we]_p1493 shall see, led to mischief, for [Tinker Bell]_n591 hated to be under an obligation to [Wendy]_n592. In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and [they]_p1494 flew on in silence. [It]_p1495 was the stillest silence [they]_p1496 had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which [Peter]_n593 explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but [he]_p1497 said [it]_p1498 was the redskins sharpening [their]_p1499 knives. Even these noises ceased. To [Michael]_n594 the loneliness was dreadful. ""If only something would make a sound!"". [he]_p1500 cried. As if in answer to [his]_p1501 request, the air was rent by the most tremendous crash [he]_p1502 had ever heard. The pirates had fired [Long Tom]_n595 at them.",9,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," The roar of [it]_p1503 echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to cry savagely,. ""Where are they, where are they, where are they?   Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true. When at last the heavens were steady again, [John]_n596 and [Michael]_n597 found [themselves]_p1504 alone in the darkness. [John]_n598 was treading the air mechanically, and [Michael]_n599 without knowing how to float was floating. ""Are [you]_p1505 shot?"". [John]_n600 whispered tremulously. ""I haven't tried [myself out] yet,"". [Michael]_n601 whispered back. [We]_p1506 know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while [Wendy]_n602 was blown upwards with no companion but [Tinker Bell]_n603.",8,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p1507 would have been well for [Wendy]_n604 if at that moment [she]_p1508 had dropped the hat. [I]_p1509 don't know whether the idea came suddenly to [Tink]_n605 , or whether [she]_p1510 had planned [it]_p1512 on the way, but [she]_p1511 at once popped out of the hat and began to lure [Wendy]_n606 to [her]_p1513 destruction. [Tink]_n607 was not all bad or, rather, [she]_p1514 was all bad just now, but, on the other hand, sometimes [she]_p1515 was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other, because being so small [they]_p1516 unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. [They]_p1517 are, however, allowed to change, only [it]_p1518 must be a complete change. At present [she]_p1519 was full of jealousy of [Wendy]_n608. What [she]_p1520 said in [her]_p1522 lovely tinkle [Wendy]_n609 could not of course understand, and [I]_p1523 believe some of [it]_p1524 was bad words, but [it]_p1525 sounded kind, and [she]_p1521 flew back and forward, plainly meaning. ""Follow me, and all will be well. What else could poor [Wendy]_n610 do? [She]_p1526 called to [Peter]_n611 and [John]_n612 and [Michael]_n613 , and got only mocking echoes in reply. [She]_p1527 did not yet know that [Tink]_n614 hated [her]_p1528 with the fierce hatred of a very woman.",11,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," And so, bewildered, and now staggering in [her]_p1529 flight, [she]_p1531 followed [Tink]_n615 to [her]_p1530 doom. Chapter 5 THE [ISLAND]_n616 [COME]_n617 [TRUE]_n618 Feeling that Peter was on [his]_p1532 way back, the [Neverland]_n619 had again woke into life. [We]_p1533 ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was always used by [Peter]_n620. In [his]_p1534 absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to [their]_p1535 young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet [they]_p1537 merely bite [their]_p1536 thumbs at each other. But with the coming of [Peter]_n621 , who hates lethargy, [they]_p1538 are under way again: if [you]_p1539 put [your]_p1541 ear to the ground now, [you]_p1540 would hear the whole island seething with life. On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. The lost boys were out looking for [Peter]_n622 , the pirates were out looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. [They]_p1542 were going round and round the island, but [they]_p1543 did not meet because all were going at the same rate. All wanted blood except the boys, who liked [it]_p1544 as a rule, but [to-night]_n623 were out to greet [their]_p1545 captain.",9,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers, according as [they]_p1546 get killed and so on and when [they]_p1547 seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, [Peter]_n624 thins [them]_p1548 out but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two. Let [us]_p1550 pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch [them]_p1551 as [they]_p1552 steal by in single file, each with [his]_p1553 hand on [his]_p1554 dagger. [They]_p1555 are forbidden by [Peter]_n625 to look in the least like him, and [they]_p1556 wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which [they]_p1557 are so round and furry that when [they]_p1557 fall [they]_p1558 roll. [They]_p1560 have therefore become very sure-footed. The first to pass is [Tootles]_n626 , not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band. [He]_p1561 had been in fewer adventures than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when [he]_p1562 had stepped round the corner all would be quiet, [he]_p1563 would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then when [he]_p1563 returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to [his]_p1565 countenance, but instead of souring [his]_p1566 nature had sweetened it, so that [he]_p1567 was quite the humblest of the boys. [Poor]_n627 kind [Tootles]_n628 , there is danger in the air for [you]_p1568 [to-night]_n629. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if accepted, will plunge [you]_p1569 in deepest woe. [Tootles]_n630 , the fairy [Tink]_n631 , who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool [for doing [her]_p1571 mischief], and [she]_p1572 thinks [you]_p1573 are the most easily tricked of the boys.",8,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," [Ware Tinker Bell]_n632. Would that [he]_p1574 could hear us, but [we]_p1576 are not really on the island, and [he]_p1575 passes by, biting [his]_p1577 knuckles. [Next]_n633 comes [Nibs]_n634 , the gay and debonair, followed by [Slightly]_n635 , who cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to [his]_p1578 own tunes. [Slightly]_n636 is the most conceited of the boys. [He]_p1579 thinks [he]_p1580 remembers the days before [he]_p1581 was lost, with [their]_p1582 manners and customs, and this has given [his]_p1583 nose an offensive tilt. [Curly]_n637 is fourth [he]_p1584 is a pickle, [a person who gets in pickles-predicaments] and so often has [he]_p1585 had to deliver up [his]_p1586 person when [Peter]_n638 said sternly,. ""Stand forth the one who did this thing,"". that now at the command [he]_p1587 stands forth automatically whether [he]_p1588 has done [it]_p1589 or not. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because [we]_p1590 should be sure to be describing the wrong one. [Peter]_n639 never quite knew what twins were, and [his]_p1591 band were not allowed to know anything [he]_p1592 did not know, so these two were always vague about themselves, and did [their]_p1593 best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.",8,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on [their]_p1594 track. [We]_p1595 hear [them]_p1596 before [they]_p1597 are seen, and [it]_p1598 is always the same dreadful song:. ""[Avast]_n640 belay, yo ho, heave to, A-pirating [we]_p1599 go, And if we're parted by a shot We're sure to meet below! A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, a little in advance, ever and again with [his]_p1601 head to the ground listening, [his]_p1602 great arms bare, pieces of eight in [his]_p1602 ears as ornaments, is the handsome [Italian Cecco]_n641 , who cut [his]_p1603 name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at [Gao]_n642. That gigantic black behind [him]_p1605 has had many names since [he]_p1606 dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify [their]_p1607 children on the banks of the [Guadjo-mo]_n643. Here is [Bill Jukes]_n644 , every inch of [him]_p1608 tattooed, the same [Bill Jukes]_n645 who got six dozen on the [WALRUS]_n646 from [Flint]_n647 before [he]_p1609 would drop the bag of moidores [Portuguese gold pieces] and [Cookson]_n648 , said to be [Black Murphy]_n649 's brother (but this was never proved), and [Gentleman Starkey]_n650 , once an usher in a public school and still dainty in [his]_p1610 ways of killing and Skylights ([Morgan]_n651 's Skylights) and the [Irish]_n652 bo'sun [Smee]_n653 , an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only [Non-conformist]_n654 in [Hook]_n655 's crew and [Noodler]_n656 , whose hands were fixed on backwards and [Robt]_n657. [Mullins]_n658 and [Alf Mason]_n659 and many another ruffian long known and feared on the [Spanish Main]_n660. In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined [James Hook]_n661 , or as [he]_p1611 wrote himself, [Jas]_n662. [Hook]_n663 , of whom [it]_p1612 is said [he]_p1613 was the only man that the [Sea-Cook]_n664 feared. [He]_p1614 lay at [his]_p1615 ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by [his]_p1616 men, and instead of a right hand [he]_p1617 had the iron hook with which ever and anon [he]_p1618 encouraged [them]_p1619 to increase [their]_p1620 pace.",25,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs [they]_p1621 obeyed him. In person [he]_p1622 was cadaverous [dead looking] and blackavized [dark faced], and [his]_p1623 hair was dressed in long curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly threatening expression to [his]_p1624 handsome countenance. [His]_p1625 eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when [he]_p1626 was plunging [his]_p1627 hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in [them]_p1628 and lit [them]_p1629 up horribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that [he]_p1630 even ripped [you]_p1632 up with an air, and [I]_p1633 have been told that [he]_p1631 was a RACONTEUR [storyteller] of repute. [He]_p1634 was never more sinister than when [he]_p1635 was most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding and the elegance of [his]_p1637 diction, even when [he]_p1636 was swearing, no less than the distinction of [his]_p1638 demeanour, showed [him]_p1640 one of a different cast from [his]_p1638 crew. A man of indomitable courage, [it]_p1641 was said that the only thing [he]_p1642 shied at was the sight of [his]_p1643 own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress [he]_p1644 somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of [Charles II]_n665 , having heard [it]_p1647 said in some earlier period of [his]_p1648 career that [he]_p1645 bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts and in [his]_p1649 mouth [he]_p1645 had a holder of [his]_p1649 own contrivance which enabled [him]_p1651 to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of [him]_p1652 was [his]_p1653 iron claw. Let [us]_p1654 now kill a pirate, to show [Hook]_n666 's method. Skylights will do.",2,,34,
barrie_peter_pan," As [they]_p1655 pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling [his]_p1656 lace collar the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. [He]_p1657 has not even taken the cigars from [his]_p1658 mouth. Such is the terrible man against whom [Peter Pan]_n667 is pitted. Which will win?  On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of [them]_p1659 with [his]_p1660 eyes peeled. [They]_p1661 carry tomahawks and knives, and [their]_p1662 naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around [them]_p1663 are scalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the [Piccaninny]_n668 tribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great [Big Little Panther]_n669 , a brave of so many scalps that in [his]_p1664 present position [they]_p1666 somewhat impede [his]_p1665 progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes [Tiger Lily]_n670 , proudly erect, a princess in [her]_p1667 own right. [She]_p1668 is the most beautiful of [dusky Dianas]_n671 [[Diana]_n672 = goddess of the woods] and the belle of the Piccaninnies, [coquettish]_n673 [flirting], cold and amorous [loving] by turns there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife, but [she]_p1669 staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe how [they]_p1670 pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise.",7,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," The only sound to be heard is [their]_p1671 somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that [they]_p1672 are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time [they]_p1673 will work this off. For the moment, however, [it]_p1674 constitutes [their]_p1675 chief danger. The redskins disappear as [they]_p1676 have come like shadows, and soon [their]_p1677 place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. [Their]_p1678 tongues are hanging out, [they]_p1679 are hungry [to-night]_n674. When [they]_p1680 have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. [We]_p1681 shall see for whom [she]_p1682 is looking presently. The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes [its]_p1683 pace. Then quickly [they]_p1684 will be on top of each other. All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind.",1,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," This shows how real the island was. The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. [They]_p1685 flung [themselves]_p1686 down on the sward [turf], close to [their]_p1687 underground home. ""I do wish [Peter]_n675 would come back,"". every one of [them]_p1688 said nervously, though in height and still more in breadth [they]_p1689 were all larger than [their]_p1690 captain. ""I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,"". [Slightly]_n676 said, in the tone that prevented [his]_p1691 being a general favourite but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him, for [he]_p1692 added hastily,. ""but [I]_p1693 wish [he]_p1694 would come back, and tell [us]_p1696 whether [he]_p1695 has heard anything more about [Cinderella]_n677. [They]_p1697 talked of [Cinderella]_n678 , and [Tootles]_n679 was confident that [his]_p1698 mother must have been very like her. [It]_p1699 was only in [Peter]_n680 's absence that [they]_p1700 could speak of mothers, the subject being forbidden by [him]_p1701 as silly.",6,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," ""All [I]_p1702 remember about [my]_p1703 mother,"". [Nibs]_n681 told them,. ""is that [she]_p1704 often said to [my]_p1705 father, Oh, how [I]_p1708 wish [I]_p1709 had a cheque-book of [my]_p1706 own!' [I]_p1709 don't know what a cheque-book is, but [I]_p1710 should just love to give [my]_p1706 mother one. While [they]_p1712 talked [they]_p1713 heard a distant sound. [You]_p1714 or I, not being wild things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but [they]_p1715 heard it, and [it]_p1716 was the grim song:. ""Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life, The flag o' skull and bones, A merry hour, a hempen rope, And hey for [Davy Jones]_n682. At once the lost boys, but where are they? [They]_p1718 are no longer there. Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly. [I]_p1719 will tell [you]_p1720 where [they]_p1721 are. With the exception of [Nibs]_n683 , who has darted away to reconnoitre [look around], [they]_p1722 are already in [their]_p1723 home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which [we]_p1724 shall see a good deal presently.",3,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," But how have [they]_p1725 reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and [you]_p1726 may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in [its]_p1727 hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground, for which [Hook]_n684 has been searching in vain these many moons. Will [he]_p1728 find [it]_p1729 tonight? As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of [Starkey]_n685 sighted [Nibs]_n686 disappearing through the wood, and at once [his]_p1730 pistol flashed out. But an iron claw gripped [his]_p1731 shoulder. ""[Captain]_n687 , let go!"". [he]_p1732 cried, writhing. Now for the first time [we]_p1733 hear the voice of [Hook]_n688. [It]_p1734 was a black voice. ""Put back that pistol first,"".",5,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [it]_p1735 said threateningly. ""It was one of those boys [you]_p1736 hate. [I]_p1737 could have shot [him]_p1738 dead. ""Ay, and the sound would have brought [Tiger Lily]_n689 's redskins upon us. Do [you]_p1739 want to lose [your]_p1740 scalp?. ""[Shall]_n690 [I]_p1741 after him, [Captain]_n691 ,"". asked pathetic [Smee]_n692 ,. ""and tickle [him]_p1742 with [Johnny]_n693 Corkscrew?"". [Smee]_n694 had pleasant names for everything, and [his]_p1743 cutlass was [Johnny]_n695 Corkscrew, because [he]_p1744 wiggled [it]_p1745 in the wound. [[One]_n696 ]_p1746 could mention many lovable traits in [Smee]_n697.",9,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," For instance, after killing, [it]_p1747 was [his]_p1748 spectacles [he]_p1750 wiped instead of [his]_p1749 weapon. ""[Johnny]_n698 's a silent fellow,"". [he]_p1751 reminded [Hook]_n699. ""Not now, [Smee]_n700 ,"". [Hook]_n701 said darkly. ""He is only one, and [I]_p1752 want to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them. The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment [their]_p1753 [Captain]_n702 and [Smee]_n703 were alone. [Hook]_n704 heaved a heavy sigh, and [I]_p1754 know not why [it]_p1755 was, perhaps [it]_p1756 was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over [him]_p1757 a desire to confide to [his]_p1758 faithful bo'sun the story of [his]_p1759 life. [He]_p1760 spoke long and earnestly, but what [it]_p1761 was all about [Smee]_n705 , who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.",8,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [Anon]_n706 [later] [he]_p1762 caught the word [Peter]_n707. ""Most of all,"". [Hook]_n708 was saying passionately,. ""I want [their]_p1763 captain, [Peter Pan]_n709. Twas [he]_p1764 cut off [my]_p1765 arm. "". [He]_p1766 brandished the hook threateningly. ""I've waited long to shake [his]_p1767 hand with this. Oh, I'll tear him!. ""And yet,"".",4,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Smee]_n710 ,. ""I have often heard [you]_p1768 say that hook was worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses. ""Ay,"". the captain answered,. ""if [I]_p1769 was a mother [I]_p1770 would pray to have [my]_p1771 children born with this instead of that,"". and [he]_p1772 cast a look of pride upon [his]_p1773 iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again [he]_p1774 frowned. ""[Peter]_n711 flung [my]_p1775 arm,"". [he]_p1776 said, wincing,. ""to a crocodile that happened to be passing by.",2,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I have often,"". said [Smee]_n712 ,. ""noticed [your]_p1777 strange dread of crocodiles. ""Not of crocodiles,"". [Hook]_n713 corrected him,. ""but of that one crocodile. "". [He]_p1778 lowered [his]_p1779 voice. ""It liked [my]_p1780 arm so much, [Smee]_n714 , that [it]_p1781 has followed [me]_p1782 ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking [its]_p1784 lips for the rest of me. ""In a way,"".",3,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Smee]_n715 ,. ""it's sort of a compliment. ""I want no such compliments,"". [Hook]_n716 barked petulantly. ""I want [Peter Pan]_n717 , who first gave the brute [its]_p1785 taste for me. [He]_p1786 sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in [his]_p1787 voice. ""[Smee]_n718 ,"". [he]_p1788 said huskily,. ""that crocodile would have had [me]_p1789 before this, but by a lucky chance [it]_p1791 swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it, and so before [it]_p1792 can reach [me]_p1790 [I]_p1794 hear the tick and bolt. "".",4,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p1795 laughed, but in a hollow way. ""Some day,"". said [Smee]_n719 ,. ""the clock will run down, and then he'll get you. [Hook]_n720 wetted [his]_p1796 dry lips. ""Ay,"". [he]_p1797 said,. ""that's the fear that haunts me. Since sitting down [he]_p1798 had felt curiously warm. ""[Smee]_n721 ,"".",3,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p1799 said,. ""this seat is hot. "". [He]_p1800 jumped up. ""Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I'm burning. [They]_p1801 examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland [they]_p1802 tried to pull [it]_p1803 up, and [it]_p1804 came away at once in [their]_p1806 hands, for [it]_p1804 had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirates looked at each other. ""A chimney!"". [they]_p1807 both exclaimed.",0,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p1808 had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. [It]_p1809 was the custom of the boys to stop [it]_p1810 with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood. Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's voices, for so safe did the boys feel in [their]_p1811 hiding-place that [they]_p1812 were gaily chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. [They]_p1813 looked around [them]_p1814 and noted the holes in the seven trees. ""Did [you]_p1815 hear [them]_p1816 say [Peter Pan]_n722 's from home?"". [Smee]_n723 whispered, fidgeting with [Johnny]_n724 Corkscrew. [Hook]_n725 nodded. [He]_p1817 stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdling smile lit up [his]_p1818 swarthy face.",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [Smee]_n726 had been waiting for it. ""Unrip [your]_p1819 plan, captain,"". [he]_p1820 cried eagerly. ""To return to the ship,"". [Hook]_n727 replied slowly through [his]_p1821 teeth,. ""and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that [they]_p1822 did not need a door apiece. That shows [they]_p1823 have no mother. [We]_p1824 will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids' [Lagoon]_n728.",3,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. [They]_p1825 will find the cake and [they]_p1826 will gobble [it]_p1828 up, because, having no mother, [they]_p1827 don't know how dangerous tis to eat rich damp cake. "". [He]_p1829 burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. ""[Aha]_n729 , [they]_p1830 will die. [Smee]_n730 had listened with growing admiration. ""It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever [I]_p1831 heard of!"". [he]_p1832 cried, and in [their]_p1833 exultation [they]_p1834 danced and sang:. ""[Avast]_n731 , belay, when [I]_p1835 appear, By fear they're overtook [Nought]_n732 's left upon [your]_p1836 bones when [you]_p1837 Have shaken claws with [Hook]_n733. [They]_p1838 began the verse, but [they]_p1839 never finished it, for another sound broke in and stilled them.",5,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on [it]_p1840 and smothered it, but as [it]_p1841 came nearer [it]_p1841 was more distinct. Tick tick tick tick! [Hook]_n734 stood shuddering, one foot in the air. ""The crocodile!"". [he]_p1844 gasped, and bounded away, followed by [his]_p1845 bo'sun. [It]_p1846 was indeed the crocodile. [It]_p1847 had passed the redskins, who were now on the trail of the other pirates. [It]_p1848 oozed on after [Hook]_n735. Once more the boys emerged into the open but the dangers of the night were not yet over, for presently [Nibs]_n736 rushed breathless into [their]_p1849 midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out the baying of [them]_p1850 was horrible. ""Save me, save me!"".",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," cried [Nibs]_n737 , falling on the ground. ""But what can [we]_p1851 do, what can [we]_p1852 do? [It]_p1853 was a high compliment to [Peter]_n738 that at that dire moment [their]_p1854 thoughts turned to him. ""What would [Peter]_n739 do?"". [they]_p1855 cried simultaneously. Almost in the same breath [they]_p1856 cried,. ""[Peter]_n740 would look at [them]_p1857 through [his]_p1858 legs. And then,. ""Let [us]_p1859 do what [Peter]_n741 would do. [It]_p1860 is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy [they]_p1861 bent and looked through [their]_p1862 legs. The next moment is the long one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon [them]_p1863 in the terrible attitude, the wolves dropped [their]_p1864 tails and fled.",5,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," Now [Nibs]_n742 rose from the ground, and the others thought that [his]_p1865 staring eyes still saw the wolves. But [it]_p1866 was not wolves [he]_p1867 saw. ""I have seen a wonderfuller thing,"". [he]_p1868 cried, as [they]_p1869 gathered round [him]_p1870 eagerly. ""A great white bird. [It]_p1871 is flying this way. ""What kind of a bird, do [you]_p1872 think?. ""I don't know,"". [Nibs]_n743 said, awestruck,. ""but [it]_p1873 looks so weary, and as [it]_p1874 flies [it]_p1874 moans, [Poor]_n744 [Wendy]_n745.",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," '. ""[Poor]_n746 [Wendy]_n747 ?. ""I remember,"". said [Slightly]_n748 instantly,. ""there are birds called Wendies. ""See, [it]_p1876 comes!"". cried [Curly]_n749 , pointing to [Wendy]_n750 in the heavens. [Wendy]_n751 was now almost overhead, and [they]_p1877 could hear [her]_p1878 plaintive cry. But more distinct came the shrill voice of [Tinker Bell]_n752. The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting at [her]_p1879 victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time [she]_p1880 touched.",7,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Hullo]_n753 , [Tink]_n754 ,"". cried the wondering boys. [Tink]_n755 's reply rang out:. ""[Peter]_n756 wants [you]_p1881 to shoot the [Wendy]_n757. [It]_p1882 was not in [their]_p1883 nature to question when [Peter]_n758 ordered. ""Let [us]_p1884 do what [Peter]_n759 wishes!"". cried the simple boys. ""[Quick]_n760 , bows and arrows! All but [Tootles]_n761 popped down [their]_p1885 trees. [He]_p1886 had a bow and arrow with him, and [Tink]_n762 noted it, and rubbed [her]_p1887 little hands. ""[Quick]_n763 , [Tootles]_n764 , quick,"".",12,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p1888 screamed. ""[Peter]_n765 will be so pleased. [Tootles]_n766 excitedly fitted the arrow to [his]_p1889 bow. ""Out of the way, [Tink]_n767 , [he]_p1890 shouted, and then [he]_p1891 fired, and [Wendy]_n768 fluttered to the ground with an arrow in [her]_p1892 breast. Chapter 6 THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish [Tootles]_n769 was standing like a conqueror over [Wendy]_n770 's body when the other boys sprang, armed, from [their]_p1893 trees. ""You are too late,"". [he]_p1894 cried proudly,. ""I have shot the [Wendy]_n771. [Peter]_n772 will be so pleased with me. [Overhead Tinker Bell]_n773 shouted.",9,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Silly ass!"". and darted into hiding. The others did not hear her. [They]_p1895 had crowded round [Wendy]_n774 , and as [they]_p1896 looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If [Wendy]_n775 's heart had been beating [they]_p1897 would all have heard it. [Slightly]_n776 was the first to speak. ""This is no bird,"". [he]_p1898 said in a scared voice. ""I think this must be a [lady]_n777. ""A [lady]_n778 ?"".",5,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Tootles]_n779 , and fell a-trembling. ""And [we]_p1899 have killed her,"". [Nibs]_n780 said hoarsely. [They]_p1900 all whipped off [their]_p1901 caps. ""Now [I]_p1902 see,"". [Curly]_n781 said:. ""[Peter]_n782 was bringing [her]_p1903 to us. "". [He]_p1904 threw [himself]_p1905 sorrowfully on the ground. ""A [lady]_n783 to take care of [us]_p1906 at last,"".",5,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," said one of the twins,. ""and [you]_p1907 have killed her!   [They]_p1908 were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when [he]_p1909 took a step nearer [them]_p1910 [they]_p1911 turned from him. [Tootles]_n784 ' face was very white, but there was a dignity about [him]_p1912 now that had never been there before. ""I did it,"". [he]_p1913 said, reflecting. ""When ladies used to come to [me]_p1914 in dreams, [I]_p1915 said, [Pretty]_n785 mother, pretty mother. ' But when at last [she]_p1916 really came, [I]_p1917 shot her. [He]_p1918 moved slowly away. ""Don't go,"". [they]_p1919 called in pity.",2,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I must,"". [he]_p1920 answered, shaking. ""I am so afraid of [Peter]_n786. [It]_p1921 was at this tragic moment that [they]_p1922 heard a sound which made the heart of every one of [them]_p1923 rise to [his]_p1924 mouth. [They]_p1925 heard [Peter]_n787 crow. ""[Peter]_n788 !"". [they]_p1926 cried, for [it]_p1927 was always thus that [he]_p1928 signalled [his]_p1929 return. ""[Hide]_n789 her,"". [they]_p1930 whispered, and gathered hastily around [Wendy]_n790. But [Tootles]_n791 stood [aloof]_n792.",7,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," Again came that ringing crow, and [Peter]_n793 dropped in front of them. ""Greetings, boys,"". [he]_p1931 cried, and mechanically [they]_p1932 saluted, and then again was silence. [He]_p1933 frowned. ""I am back,"". [he]_p1934 said hotly,. ""why do [you]_p1935 not cheer?   [They]_p1936 opened [their]_p1937 mouths, but the cheers would not come. [He]_p1938 overlooked [it]_p1939 in [his]_p1940 haste to tell the glorious tidings. ""[Great]_n794 news, boys,"". [he]_p1941 cried,.",2,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I have brought at last a mother for [you]_p1942 all. Still no sound, except a little thud from [Tootles]_n795 as [he]_p1943 dropped on [his]_p1944 knees. ""Have [you]_p1945 not seen her?"". asked [Peter]_n796 , becoming troubled. ""She flew this way. ""Ah me!"". one voice said, and another said,. ""Oh, mournful day. [Tootles]_n797 rose. ""[Peter]_n798 ,"".",4,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p1946 said quietly,. ""I will show [her]_p1947 to you,"". and when the others would still have hidden [her]_p1948 [he]_p1949 said,. ""Back, twins, let [Peter]_n799 see. So [they]_p1950 all stood back, and let [him]_p1951 see, and after [he]_p1952 had looked for a little time [he]_p1953 did not know what to do next. ""She is dead,"". [he]_p1954 said uncomfortably. ""Perhaps [she]_p1955 is frightened at being dead. [He]_p1956 thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till [he]_p1957 was out of sight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. [They]_p1958 would all have been glad to follow if [he]_p1959 had done this.",1,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," But there was the arrow. [He]_p1960 took [it]_p1961 from [her]_p1962 heart and faced [his]_p1963 band. ""Whose arrow?"". [he]_p1964 demanded sternly. ""[Mine]_n800 , [Peter]_n801 ,"". said [Tootles]_n802 on [his]_p1965 knees. ""Oh, dastard hand,"". [Peter]_n803 said, and [he]_p1966 raised the arrow to use [it]_p1967 as a dagger. [Tootles]_n804 did not flinch. [He]_p1968 bared [his]_p1969 breast.",5,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Strike]_n805 , [Peter]_n806 ,"". [he]_p1970 said firmly,. ""strike true. Twice did [Peter]_n807 raise the arrow, and twice did [his]_p1971 hand fall. ""I cannot strike,"". [he]_p1972 said with awe,. ""there is something stays [my]_p1973 hand. All looked at [him]_p1974 in wonder, save [Nibs]_n808 , who fortunately looked at [Wendy]_n809. ""It is she,"". [he]_p1975 cried,.",5,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""the [Wendy]_n810 [lady]_n811 , see, [her]_p1976 arm! Wonderful to relate [tell], [Wendy]_n812 had raised [her]_p1977 arm.

[Slightly]_n816 cried instantly,. ""The [Wendy]_n817 [lady]_n818 lives. Then [Peter knelt]_n819 beside [her]_p1981 and found [his]_p1982 button.

barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p1994 was begging [Wendy]_n822 to get better quickly, so that [he]_p1995 could show [her]_p1996 the mermaids. Of course [she]_p1997 could not answer yet, being still in a frightful faint but from overhead came a wailing note. ""[Listen]_n823 to [Tink]_n824 ,"". said [Curly]_n825 ,. ""she is crying because the [Wendy]_n826 lives. Then [they]_p1998 had to tell [Peter]_n827 of [Tink]_n828 's crime, and almost never had [they]_p1999 seen [him]_p2000 look so stern. ""[Listen]_n829 , [Tinker Bell]_n830 ,"". [he]_p2001 cried,. ""I am [your]_p2002 friend no more. Begone from [me]_p2003 for ever.",9,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p2004 flew on to [his]_p2005 shoulder and pleaded, but [he]_p2006 brushed [her]_p2007 off. Not until [Wendy]_n831 again raised [her]_p2008 arm did [he]_p2009 relent sufficiently to say,. ""Well, not for ever, but for a whole week. Do [you]_p2010 think [Tinker Bell]_n832 was grateful to [Wendy]_n833 for raising [her]_p2011 arm? Oh dear no, never wanted to pinch [her]_p2012 so much. Fairies indeed are strange, and [Peter]_n834 , who understood [them]_p2013 best, often cuffed [slapped] them. But what to do with [Wendy]_n835 in [her]_p2015 present delicate state of health?. ""Let [us]_p2016 carry [her]_p2017 down into the house,"". [Curly]_n836 suggested. ""Ay,"". said [Slightly]_n837 ,.",7,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""that is what one does with ladies. ""No, no,"". [Peter]_n838 said,. ""you must not touch her. [It]_p2018 would not be sufficiently respectful. ""That,"". said [Slightly]_n839 ,. ""is what [I]_p2019 was thinking. ""But if [she]_p2020 lies there,"". [Tootles]_n840 said,.",3,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," ""she will die. ""Ay, [she]_p2021 will die,"". [Slightly]_n841 admitted,. ""but there is no way out. ""Yes, there is,"". cried [Peter]_n842. ""Let [us]_p2022 build a little house round her. [They]_p2023 were all delighted. ""[Quick]_n843 ,"". [he]_p2024 ordered them,.",3,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""bring [me]_p2025 each of [you]_p2026 the best of what [we]_p2027 have. Gut [our]_p2028 house. Be sharp. In a moment [they]_p2029 were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding. [They]_p2030 skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and while [they]_p2031 were at it, who should appear but [John]_n844 and [Michael]_n845. As [they]_p2032 dragged along the ground [they]_p2033 fell [asleep]_n846 standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step and slept again. ""[John]_n847 , [John]_n848 ,"". [Michael]_n849 would cry,. ""wake up! Where is [Nana]_n850 , [John]_n851 , and mother? And then [John]_n852 would rub [his]_p2034 eyes and mutter,. ""It is true, [we]_p2035 did fly.",9,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [You]_p2036 may be sure [they]_p2037 were very relieved to find [Peter]_n853. ""[Hullo]_n854 , [Peter]_n855 ,"". [they]_p2038 said. ""[Hullo]_n856 ,"". replied [Peter]_n857 amicably, though [he]_p2039 had quite forgotten them. [He]_p2040 was very busy at the moment measuring [Wendy]_n858 with [his]_p2041 feet to see how large a house [she]_p2042 would need. Of course [he]_p2043 meant to leave room for chairs and a table. [John]_n859 and [Michael]_n860 watched him. ""Is [Wendy]_n861 [asleep]_n862 ?"". [they]_p2044 asked.",10,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes. ""[John]_n863 ,"". [Michael]_n864 proposed,. ""let [us]_p2045 wake [her]_p2047 and get [her]_p2048 to make supper for us,"". but as [he]_p2049 said [it]_p2050 some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house. ""Look at them!"". [he]_p2051 cried. ""[Curly]_n865 ,"". said [Peter]_n866 in [his]_p2052 most captainy voice,. ""see that these boys help in the building of the house.",4,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay, ay, sir. ""Build a house?"". exclaimed [John]_n867. ""For the [Wendy]_n868 ,"". said [Curly]_n869. ""For [Wendy]_n870 ?"". [John]_n871 said, aghast. ""Why, [she]_p2053 is only a girl!. ""That,"". explained [Curly]_n872 ,.",6,,1,
barrie_peter_pan," ""is why [we]_p2054 are [her]_p2055 servants. ""You? [Wendy]_n873 's servants!. ""Yes,"". said [Peter]_n874 ,. ""and [you]_p2056 also. Away with them. The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry. ""Chairs and a fender [fireplace] first,"". [Peter]_n875 ordered. ""Then [we]_p2057 shall build a house round them.",3,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay,"". said [Slightly]_n876 ,. ""that is how a house is built [it]_p2058 all comes back to me. [Peter]_n877 thought of everything. ""[Slightly]_n878 ,"". [he]_p2059 cried,. ""fetch a doctor. ""Ay, ay,"". said [Slightly]_n879 at once, and disappeared, scratching [his]_p2060 head. But [he]_p2061 knew [Peter]_n880 must be obeyed, and [he]_p2062 returned in a moment, wearing [John]_n881 's hat and looking solemn.",6,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Please, sir,"". said [Peter]_n882 , going to him,. ""are [you]_p2063 a doctor?   The difference between [him]_p2064 and the other boys at such a time was that [they]_p2066 knew [it]_p2067 was make-believe, while to [him]_p2065 make-believe and true were exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when [they]_p2068 had to make-believe that [they]_p2069 had had [their]_p2070 dinners. If [they]_p2071 broke down in [their]_p2072 make-believe [he]_p2073 rapped [them]_p2074 on the knuckles. ""Yes, [my]_p2075 little man,"". [Slightly]_n883 anxiously replied, who had chapped knuckles. ""Please, sir,"". [Peter]_n884 explained,. ""a [lady]_n885 lies very ill.",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p2076 was lying at [their]_p2077 feet, but [Slightly]_n886 had the sense not to see her. ""[Tut]_n887 , tut, tut,"". [he]_p2078 said,. ""where does [she]_p2079 lie?. ""In yonder glade. ""I will put a glass thing in [her]_p2080 mouth,"". said [Slightly]_n888 , and [he]_p2081 made-believe to do it, while [Peter]_n889 waited. [It]_p2082 was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn. ""How is she?"". inquired [Peter]_n890.",5,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Tut]_n891 , tut, tut,"". said [Slightly]_n892 ,. ""this has cured her. ""I am glad!"". [Peter]_n893 cried. ""I will call again in the evening,"". [Slightly]_n894 said. ""give [her]_p2083 beef tea out of a cup with a spout to [it]_p2084 "". but after [he]_p2085 had returned the hat to [John]_n895 [he]_p2086 blew big breaths, which was [his]_p2087 habit on escaping from a difficulty. In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at [Wendy]_n896 's feet.",6,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""If only [we]_p2088 knew,"". said one,. ""the kind of house [she]_p2089 likes best. ""[Peter]_n897 ,"". shouted another,. ""she is moving in [her]_p2090 sleep. ""Her mouth opens,"". cried a third, looking respectfully into it. ""Oh, lovely!. ""Perhaps [she]_p2091 is going to sing in [her]_p2092 sleep,"".",1,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Peter]_n898. ""[Wendy]_n899 , sing the kind of house [you]_p2093 would like to have. Immediately, without opening [her]_p2094 eyes, [Wendy]_n900 began to sing:. ""I wish [I]_p2095 had a pretty house, The littlest ever seen, With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green. [They]_p2097 gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches [they]_p2098 had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted with moss. As [they]_p2099 rattled up the little house [they]_p2100 broke into song themselves:. ""We've built the little walls and roof And made a lovely door, So tell us, mother [Wendy]_n901 , What are [you]_p2101 wanting more? To this [she]_p2102 answered greedily:. ""Oh, really next [I]_p2103 think I'll have [Gay]_n902 windows all about, With roses peeping in, [you]_p2105 know, And babies peeping out. With a blow of [their]_p2106 fists [they]_p2107 made windows, and large yellow leaves were the blinds. But roses, ?.",5,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Roses,"". cried [Peter]_n903 sternly. Quickly [they]_p2108 made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls. Babies? To prevent [Peter]_n904 ordering babies [they]_p2109 hurried into song again:. ""We've made the roses peeping out, The babes are at the door, [We]_p2110 cannot make ourselves, [you]_p2112 know, cos we've been made before. [Peter]_n905 , seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that [it]_p2113 was [his]_p2114 own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt [Wendy]_n906 was very cosy within, though, of course, [they]_p2115 could no longer see her. [Peter]_n907 strode up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped [his]_p2116 eagle eyes. Just when [it]_p2117 seemed absolutely finished:.",5,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""There's no knocker on the door,"". [he]_p2118 said. [They]_p2119 were very ashamed, but [Tootles]_n908 gave the sole of [his]_p2120 shoe, and [it]_p2121 made an excellent knocker. Absolutely finished now, [they]_p2122 thought. Not of bit of it. ""There's no chimney,"". [Peter]_n909 said. ""we must have a chimney. ""It certainly does need a chimney,"". said [John]_n910 importantly.",3,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," This gave [Peter]_n911 an idea. [He]_p2123 snatched the hat off [John]_n912 's head, knocked out the bottom [top], and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began to come out of the hat. Now really and truly [it]_p2124 was finished. Nothing remained to do but to knock. ""All look [your]_p2125 best,"". [Peter]_n913 warned [them]_p2126. ""first impressions are awfully important. [He]_p2127 was glad no one asked [him]_p2128 what first impressions are [they]_p2129 were all too busy looking [their]_p2130 best. [He]_p2131 knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a sound to be heard except from [Tinker Bell]_n914 , who was watching from a branch and openly sneering.",4,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a [lady]_n915 , what would [she]_p2132 be like? The door opened and a [lady]_n916 came out. [It]_p2133 was [Wendy]_n917. [They]_p2134 all whipped off [their]_p2135 hats. [She]_p2136 looked properly surprised, and this was just how [they]_p2137 had hoped [she]_p2138 would look. ""Where am I?"". [she]_p2139 said. Of course [Slightly]_n918 was the first to get [his]_p2140 word in. ""[Wendy]_n919 [lady]_n920 ,"". [he]_p2141 said rapidly,. ""for [you]_p2142 [we]_p2143 built this house.",6,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Oh, say you're pleased,"". cried [Nibs]_n921. ""Lovely, darling house,"". [Wendy]_n922 said, and [they]_p2144 were the very words [they]_p2145 had hoped [she]_p2146 would say. ""And [we]_p2147 are [your]_p2148 children,"". cried the twins. Then all went on [their]_p2149 knees, and holding out [their]_p2150 arms cried,. ""O [Wendy]_n923 [lady]_n924 , be [our]_p2151 mother. ""Ought I?"". [Wendy]_n925 said, all shining.",5,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Of course it's frightfully fascinating, but [you]_p2152 see [I]_p2153 am only a little girl. [I]_p2154 have no real experience. ""That doesn't matter,"". said [Peter]_n926 , as if [he]_p2155 were the only person present who knew all about it, though [he]_p2156 was really the one who knew least. ""What [we]_p2157 need is just a nice motherly person. ""Oh dear!"". [Wendy]_n927 said,. ""you see, [I]_p2158 feel that is exactly what [I]_p2159 am. ""It is, [it]_p2160 is,"". [they]_p2161 all cried.",2,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""we saw [it]_p2162 at once. ""Very well,"". [she]_p2163 said,. ""I will do [my]_p2164 best. Come inside at once, [you]_p2165 naughty children [I]_p2166 am sure [your]_p2167 feet are damp. And before [I]_p2168 put [you]_p2170 to bed [I]_p2169 have just time to finish the story of [Cinderella]_n928. In [they]_p2171 went [I]_p2172 don't know how there was room for them, but [you]_p2173 can squeeze very tight in the [Neverland]_n929. And that was the first of the many joyous evenings [they]_p2174 had with [Wendy]_n930. By and by [she]_p2175 tucked [them]_p2177 up in the great bed in the home under the trees, but [she]_p2176 [herself]_p2178 slept that night in the little house, and [Peter]_n931 kept watch outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing through [its]_p2179 blinds, and the chimney smoking beautifully, and [Peter]_n932 standing on guard.",5,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," After a time [he]_p2180 fell [asleep]_n933 , and some unsteady fairies had to climb over [him]_p2181 on [their]_p2182 way home from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night [they]_p2183 would have mischiefed, but [they]_p2184 just tweaked [Peter]_n934 's nose and passed on. Chapter 7 THE [HOME UNDER]_n935 THE [GROUND]_n936 [One]_n937 of the first things [Peter]_n938 did next day was to measure [Wendy]_n939 and [John]_n940 and [Michael]_n941 for hollow trees. [Hook]_n942 , [you]_p2185 remember, had sneered at the boys for thinking [they]_p2187 needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless [your]_p2188 tree fitted [you]_p2186 [it]_p2189 was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once [you]_p2190 fitted, [you]_p2191 drew in [let out] [your]_p2194 breath at the top, and down [you]_p2191 went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend [you]_p2192 drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when [you]_p2195 have mastered the action [you]_p2196 are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more graceful. But [you]_p2197 simply must fit, and [Peter]_n943 measures [you]_p2198 for [your]_p2201 tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you, while [you]_p2198 have to be made to fit the tree. Usually [it]_p2202 is done quite easily, as by [your]_p2203 wearing too many garments or too few, but if [you]_p2204 are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, [Peter]_n944 does some things to you, and after that [you]_p2205 fit. Once [you]_p2207 fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this, as [Wendy]_n945 was to discover to [her]_p2208 delight, keeps a whole family in perfect condition. [Wendy]_n946 and [Michael]_n947 fitted [their]_p2209 trees at the first try, but [John]_n948 had to be altered a little.",16,,28,
barrie_peter_pan," After a few days' practice [they]_p2210 could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well. And how ardently [they]_p2211 grew to love [their]_p2212 home under the ground especially [Wendy]_n949. [It]_p2213 consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, with a floor in which [you]_p2214 could dig [for worms] if [you]_p2215 wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A [Never]_n950 tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning [they]_p2216 sawed the trunk through, level with the floor. By [tea-time]_n951 [it]_p2217 was always about two feet high, and then [they]_p2219 put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table as soon as [they]_p2220 cleared away, [they]_p2220 sawed off the trunk again, and thus there was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where [you]_p2222 cared to light it, and across this [Wendy]_n952 stretched strings, made of fibre, from which [she]_p2223 suspended [her]_p2224 washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when [it]_p2225 filled nearly half the room and all the boys slept in it, except [Michael]_n953 , lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at once. [Michael]_n954 should have used [it]_p2227 also, but [Wendy]_n955 would have [desired] a baby, and [he]_p2229 was the littlest, and [you]_p2231 know what women are, and the short and long of [it]_p2228 is that [he]_p2230 was hung up in a basket. [It]_p2232 was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances.",7,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," But there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of [Tinker Bell]_n956. [It]_p2233 could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which [Tink]_n957 , who was most fastidious [particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room] and bed-chamber combined. The couch, as [she]_p2234 always called it, was a genuine [Queen Mab]_n958 , with club legs and [she]_p2235 varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in season. [Her]_p2236 mirror was a [Puss-in-Boots]_n959 , of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers the washstand was [Pie-crust]_n960 and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the [Sixth]_n961 , and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of [Margery]_n962 and [Robin]_n963. There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course [she]_p2237 lit the residence herself. [Tink]_n964 was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and [her]_p2238 chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up. [I]_p2239 suppose [it]_p2240 was all especially entrancing to [Wendy]_n965 , because those rampagious boys of [hers]_p2241 gave [her]_p2242 so much to do. Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, [she]_p2243 was never above ground. The cooking, [I]_p2244 can tell you, kept [her]_p2245 nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, [she]_p2248 had to keep watching that [it]_p2246 came aboil just the same.",10,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [You]_p2249 never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, [it]_p2250 all depended upon [Peter]_n966 's whim: [he]_p2253 could eat, really eat, if [it]_p2251 was part of a game, but [he]_p2254 could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel stodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than anything else the next best thing being to talk about it. [Make-believe]_n967 was so real to [him]_p2255 that during a meal of [it]_p2257 [you]_p2258 could see [him]_p2256 getting rounder. Of course [it]_p2259 was trying, but [you]_p2260 simply had to follow [his]_p2264 lead, and if [you]_p2261 could prove to [him]_p2265 that [you]_p2261 were getting loose for [your]_p2266 tree [he]_p2267 let [you]_p2262 stodge. [Wendy]_n968 's favourite time for sewing and darning was after [they]_p2268 had all gone to bed. Then, as [she]_p2269 expressed it, [she]_p2270 had a breathing time for [herself]_p2274 and [she]_p2270 occupied [it]_p2272 in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for [they]_p2275 were all most frightfully hard on [their]_p2276 knees. When [she]_p2277 sat down to a basketful of [their]_p2279 stockings, every heel with a hole in it, [she]_p2278 would fling up [her]_p2280 arms and exclaim,. ""Oh dear, [I]_p2281 am sure [I]_p2282 sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!   [Her]_p2283 face beamed when [she]_p2284 exclaimed this. [You]_p2285 remember about [her]_p2286 pet wolf. Well, [it]_p2287 very soon discovered that [she]_p2289 had come to the island and [it]_p2288 found [her]_p2290 out, and [they]_p2291 just ran into each other's arms. After that [it]_p2292 followed [her]_p2293 about everywhere.",3,,43,
barrie_peter_pan," As time wore on did [she]_p2294 think much about the beloved parents [she]_p2295 had left behind her? This is a difficult question, because [it]_p2296 is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the [Neverland]_n969 , where [it]_p2297 is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of [them]_p2298 than on the mainland. But [I]_p2299 am afraid that [Wendy]_n970 did not really worry about [her]_p2300 father and mother [she]_p2303 was absolutely confident that [they]_p2304 would always keep the window open for [her]_p2301 to fly back by, and this gave [her]_p2301 complete ease of mind. What did disturb [her]_p2305 at times was that [John]_n971 remembered [his]_p2306 parents vaguely only, as people [he]_p2308 had once known, while [Michael]_n972 was quite willing to believe that [she]_p2309 was really [his]_p2307 mother. These things scared [her]_p2310 a little, and nobly anxious to do [her]_p2311 duty, [she]_p2312 tried to fix the old life in [their]_p2314 minds by setting [them]_p2315 examination papers on it, as like as possible to the ones [she]_p2313 used to do at school. The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and [they]_p2316 made slates for themselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the questions [she]_p2317 had written on another slate and passed round. [They]_p2318 were the most ordinary questions,. ""What was the colour of [Mother]_n973 's eyes? Which was taller, [Father]_n974 or [Mother]_n975 ?[ Was M]_n976 other blonde or [brunette]_n977 ? [Answer]_n978 all three questions if possible. ""(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How [I]_p2319 spent [my]_p2320 last Holidays, or The Characters of [Father]_n979 and [Mother]_n980 compared. Only one of these to be attempted. "".",12,,27,
barrie_peter_pan," Or. ""(1) [Describe Mother]_n981 's laugh (2) [Describe Father]_n982 's laugh (3) [Describe Mother]_n983 's [Party Dress]_n984 (4) Describe the [Kennel]_n985 and [its]_p2321 Inmate. [They]_p2322 were just everyday questions like these, and when [you]_p2323 could not answer [them]_p2325 [you]_p2324 were told to make a cross and [it]_p2326 was really dreadful what a number of crosses even [John]_n986 made. Of course the only boy who replied to every question was [Slightly]_n987 , and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, but [his]_p2327 answers were perfectly ridiculous, and [he]_p2328 really came out last: a melancholy thing. [Peter]_n988 did not compete. For one thing [he]_p2329 despised all mothers except [Wendy]_n989 , and for another [he]_p2330 was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor spell not the smallest word. [He]_p2331 was above all that sort of thing. By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was the colour of [Mother]_n990 's eyes, and so on. [Wendy]_n991 , [you]_p2332 see, had been forgetting, too.",11,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," Adventures, of course, as [we]_p2333 shall see, were of daily occurrence but about this time [Peter]_n992 invented, with [Wendy]_n993 's help, a new game that fascinated [him]_p2334 enormously, until [he]_p2335 suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as [you]_p2336 have been told, was what always happened with [his]_p2337 games. [It]_p2338 consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing [John]_n994 and [Michael]_n995 had been doing all [their]_p2339 lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To see [Peter]_n996 doing nothing on a stool was a great sight [he]_p2340 could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to [him]_p2341 such a comic thing to do. [He]_p2342 boasted that [he]_p2343 had gone walking for the good of [his]_p2344 health. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to [him]_p2345 and [John]_n997 and [Michael]_n998 had to pretend to be delighted also otherwise [he]_p2346 would have treated [them]_p2347 severely. [He]_p2348 often went out alone, and when [he]_p2349 came back [you]_p2351 were never absolutely certain whether [he]_p2350 had had an adventure or not. [He]_p2352 might have forgotten [it]_p2353 so completely that [he]_p2356 said nothing about [it]_p2354 and then when [you]_p2358 went out [you]_p2359 found the body and, on the other hand, [he]_p2357 might say a great deal about it, and yet [you]_p2359 could not find the body. Sometimes [he]_p2361 came home with [his]_p2363 head bandaged, and then [Wendy]_n999 cooed over [him]_p2364 and bathed [it]_p2365 in lukewarm water, while [he]_p2362 told a dazzling tale. But [she]_p2366 was never quite sure, [you]_p2367 know. There were, however, many adventures which [she]_p2368 knew to be true because [she]_p2369 was in [them]_p2370 herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in [them]_p2371 and said [they]_p2372 were wholly true.",8,,39,
barrie_peter_pan," To describe [them]_p2373 all would require a book as large as an [English-Latin]_n1000 , [Latin-English Dictionary]_n1001 , and the most [we]_p2374 can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The difficulty is which [one]_p2375 to choose. Should [we]_p2376 take the brush with the redskins at [Slightly Gulch]_n1002 ? [It]_p2377 was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of [Peter]_n1003 's peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight [he]_p2378 would suddenly change sides. At the [Gulch]_n1004 , when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, [he]_p2379 called out,. ""I'm redskin [to-day]_n1005 what are you, [Tootles]_n1006 ?"". And [Tootles]_n1007 answered,. ""Redskin what are you, [Nibs]_n1008 ?"". and [Nibs]_n1009 said,. ""Redskin what are [you]_p2380 [Twin]_n1010 ?"". and so on and [they]_p2381 were all redskins and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by [Peter]_n1011 's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at [it]_p2383 [they]_p2382 all went again, more fiercely than ever.",12,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was, but [we]_p2384 have not decided yet that this is the adventure [we]_p2385 are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of [them]_p2386 stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or [we]_p2387 might tell how [Peter]_n1012 saved [Tiger Lily]_n1013 's life in the Mermaids' [Lagoon]_n1014 , and so made [her]_p2388 [his]_p2389 ally. Or [we]_p2390 could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat [it]_p2391 and perish and how [they]_p2396 placed [it]_p2392 in one cunning spot after another but always [Wendy]_n1015 snatched [it]_p2392 from the hands of [her]_p2397 children, so that in time [it]_p2393 lost [its]_p2398 succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and [Hook]_n1016 fell over [it]_p2393 in the dark. Or suppose [we]_p2399 tell of the birds that were [Peter]_n1017 's friends, particularly of the [Never]_n1018 bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on [her]_p2400 eggs, and [Peter]_n1019 gave orders that [she]_p2401 was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be but if [we]_p2402 tell [it]_p2404 [we]_p2403 must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was [Tinker Bell]_n1020 's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping [Wendy]_n1021 conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and [Wendy woke]_n1022 , thinking [it]_p2405 was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, [we]_p2406 might choose [Peter]_n1023 's defiance of the lions, when [he]_p2407 drew a circle round [him]_p2409 on the ground with an arrow and dared [them]_p2410 to cross [it]_p2412 and though [he]_p2408 waited for hours, with the other boys and [Wendy]_n1024 looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of [them]_p2411 dared to accept [his]_p2413 challenge. Which of these adventures shall [we]_p2414 choose? The best way will be to toss for it.",13,,31,
barrie_peter_pan," [I]_p2415 have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or [Tink]_n1025 's leaf had won. Of course [I]_p2416 could do [it]_p2417 again, and make [it]_p2418 best out of three however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon. Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON  If [you]_p2419 shut [your]_p2422 eyes and are a lucky one, [you]_p2420 may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness then if [you]_p2420 squeeze [your]_p2423 eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze [they]_p2424 must go on fire. But just before [they]_p2425 go on fire [you]_p2426 see the lagoon. This is the nearest [you]_p2427 ever get to [it]_p2429 on the mainland, just one heavenly moment if there could be two moments [you]_p2428 might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing. The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. [You]_p2430 must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, [it]_p2431 was among [Wendy]_n1026 's lasting regrets that all the time [she]_p2432 was on the island [she]_p2433 never had a civil word from one of them. When [she]_p2434 stole softly to the edge of the lagoon [she]_p2435 might see [them]_p2437 by the score, especially on Marooners' [Rock]_n1027 , where [they]_p2439 loved to bask, combing out [their]_p2441 hair in a lazy way that quite irritated [her]_p2443 or [she]_p2435 might even swim, on tiptoe as [it]_p2446 were, to within a yard of them, but then [they]_p2440 saw [her]_p2444 and dived, probably splashing [her]_p2444 with [their]_p2442 tails, not by accident, but intentionally. [They]_p2447 treated all the boys in the same way, except of course [Peter]_n1028 , who chatted with [them]_p2448 on Marooners' [Rock]_n1029 by the hour, and sat on [their]_p2449 tails when [they]_p2450 got cheeky.",5,,35,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p2451 gave [Wendy]_n1030 one of [their]_p2452 combs. The most haunting time at which to see [them]_p2453 is at the turn of the moon, when [they]_p2454 utter strange wailing cries but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which [we]_p2455 have now to tell, [Wendy]_n1031 had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course [Peter]_n1032 would have accompanied her, than because [she]_p2456 had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven. [She]_p2457 was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with [their]_p2458 bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water [they]_p2459 treat as balls, hitting [them]_p2461 gaily from one to another with [their]_p2463 tails, and trying to keep [them]_p2462 in the rainbow till [they]_p2460 burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use [their]_p2464 hands. Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and [it]_p2465 is quite a pretty sight. But the moment the children tried to join in [they]_p2466 had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless [we]_p2467 have proof that [they]_p2468 secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from [them]_p2469 for [John]_n1033 introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that [John]_n1034 has left on the [Neverland]_n1035. [It]_p2470 must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after [their]_p2471 mid-day meal.",6,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," [Wendy]_n1036 insisted on [their]_p2472 doing this, and [it]_p2473 had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe. So [they]_p2474 lay there in the sun, and [their]_p2475 bodies glistened in it, while [she]_p2476 sat beside [them]_p2477 and looked important. [It]_p2478 was one such day, and [they]_p2479 were all on Marooners' [Rock]_n1037. The rock was not much larger than [their]_p2480 great bed, but of course [they]_p2482 all knew how not to take up much room, and [they]_p2483 were dozing, or at least lying with [their]_p2481 eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when [they]_p2483 thought [Wendy]_n1038 was not looking. [She]_p2485 was very busy, stitching. While [she]_p2486 stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning [it]_p2487 cold. [Wendy]_n1039 could no longer see to thread [her]_p2489 needle, and when [she]_p2490 looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly. [It]_p2491 was not, [she]_p2492 knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come. No, worse than that.",4,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p2493 had not come, but [it]_p2494 had sent that shiver through the sea to say that [it]_p2495 was coming. What was it? There crowded upon [her]_p2498 all the stories [she]_p2499 had been told of Marooners' [Rock]_n1040 , so called because evil captains put sailors on [it]_p2496 and leave [them]_p2500 there to drown. [They]_p2501 drown when the tide rises, for then [it]_p2502 is submerged. Of course [she]_p2503 should have roused the children at once not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because [it]_p2506 was no longer good for [them]_p2504 to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But [she]_p2507 was a young mother and [she]_p2508 did not know this [she]_p2508 thought [you]_p2510 simply must stick to [your]_p2511 rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and [she]_p2512 longed to hear male voices, [she]_p2513 would not waken them. Even when [she]_p2514 heard the sound of muffled oars, though [her]_p2516 heart was in [her]_p2517 mouth, [she]_p2515 did not waken them. [She]_p2518 stood over [them]_p2519 to let [them]_p2520 have [their]_p2521 sleep out. Was [it]_p2522 not brave of [Wendy]_n1041 ? [It]_p2523 was well for those boys then that there was one among [them]_p2524 who could sniff danger even in [his]_p2525 sleep. [Peter]_n1042 sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog, and with one warning cry [he]_p2526 roused the others.",3,,32,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p2527 stood motionless, one hand to [his]_p2528 ear. ""Pirates!"". [he]_p2529 cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was playing about [his]_p2530 face, and [Wendy]_n1043 saw [it]_p2531 and shuddered. While that smile was on [his]_p2532 face no one dared address [him]_p2533 all [they]_p2534 could do was to stand ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive. ""Dive!   There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted. Marooners' [Rock]_n1044 stood alone in the forbidding waters as if [it]_p2535 were [itself]_p2536 marooned. The boat drew nearer.",2,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p2537 was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, [Smee]_n1045 and [Starkey]_n1046 , and the third a captive, no other than [Tiger Lily]_n1047. [Her]_p2538 hands and ankles were tied, and [she]_p2539 knew what was to be [her]_p2540 fate. [She]_p2541 was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of [her]_p2542 race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is [it]_p2544 not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy [hunting-ground]_n1048 ? Yet [her]_p2543 face was impassive [she]_p2546 was the daughter of a chief, [she]_p2547 must die as a chief's daughter, [it]_p2545 is enough. [They]_p2548 had caught [her]_p2549 boarding the pirate ship with a knife in [her]_p2550 mouth. No watch was kept on the ship, [it]_p2551 being [Hook]_n1049 's boast that the wind of [his]_p2552 name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now [her]_p2553 fate would help to guard [it]_p2554 also. [One]_n1050 more wail would go the round in that wind by night. In the gloom that [they]_p2555 brought with [them]_p2557 the two pirates did not see the rock till [they]_p2556 crashed into it. ""[Luff]_n1051 , [you]_p2558 lubber,"". cried an [Irish]_n1052 voice that was [Smee]_n1053 's.",9,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," ""here's the rock. Now, then, what [we]_p2559 have to do is to hoist the redskin on to [it]_p2560 and leave [her]_p2561 here to drown. [It]_p2562 was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock [she]_p2563 was too proud to offer a vain resistance. Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down, [Peter]_n1054 's and [Wendy]_n1055 's. [Wendy]_n1056 was crying, for [it]_p2564 was the first tragedy [she]_p2565 had seen. [Peter]_n1057 had seen many tragedies, but [he]_p2566 had forgotten [them]_p2567 all. [He]_p2568 was less sorry than [Wendy]_n1058 for [Tiger Lily]_n1059 : [it]_p2569 was two against one that angered him, and [he]_p2570 meant to save her. An easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but [he]_p2571 was never one to choose the easy way. There was almost nothing [he]_p2572 could not do, and [he]_p2573 now imitated the voice of [Hook]_n1060. ""Ahoy there, [you]_p2574 lubbers!"".",7,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p2575 called. [It]_p2576 was a marvellous imitation. ""The captain!"". said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise. ""He must be swimming out to us,"". [Starkey]_n1061 said, when [they]_p2577 had looked for [him]_p2578 in vain. ""We are putting the redskin on the rock,"". [Smee]_n1062 called out. ""Set [her]_p2579 free,"". came the astonishing answer.",2,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Free!. ""Yes, cut [her]_p2580 bonds and let [her]_p2581 go. ""But, captain,. ""At once, d'ye hear,"". cried [Peter]_n1063 ,. ""or I'll plunge [my]_p2582 hook in you. ""This is queer!"". [Smee]_n1064 gasped. ""Better do what the captain orders,"". said [Starkey]_n1065 nervously.",3,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay, ay,"". [Smee]_n1066 said, and [he]_p2583 cut [Tiger Lily]_n1067 's cords. At once like an eel [she]_p2584 slid between [Starkey]_n1068 's legs into the water. Of course [Wendy]_n1069 was very elated over [Peter]_n1070 's cleverness but [she]_p2585 knew that [he]_p2586 would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, so at once [her]_p2587 hand went out to cover [his]_p2588 mouth. But [it]_p2589 was stayed even in the act, for. ""Boat ahoy!"". rang over the lagoon in [Hook]_n1071 's voice, and this time [it]_p2590 was not [Peter]_n1072 who had spoken. [Peter]_n1073 may have been about to crow, but [his]_p2591 face puckered in a whistle of surprise instead. ""Boat ahoy!"". again came the voice.",8,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," Now [Wendy]_n1074 understood. The real [Hook]_n1075 was also in the water. [He]_p2592 was swimming to the boat, and as [his]_p2593 men showed a light to guide [him]_p2594 [he]_p2595 had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern [Wendy]_n1076 saw [his]_p2596 hook grip the boat's side [she]_p2598 saw [his]_p2597 evil swarthy face as [he]_p2600 rose dripping from the water, and, quaking, [she]_p2599 would have liked to swim away, but [Peter]_n1077 would not budge. [He]_p2601 was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit. ""Am [I]_p2602 not a wonder, oh, [I]_p2603 am a wonder!"". [he]_p2604 whispered to her, and though [she]_p2605 thought so also, [she]_p2606 was really glad for the sake of [his]_p2607 reputation that no one heard [him]_p2608 except herself. [He]_p2609 signed to [her]_p2610 to listen. The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought [their]_p2611 captain to them, but [he]_p2612 sat with [his]_p2613 head on [his]_p2614 hook in a position of profound melancholy. ""[Captain]_n1078 , is all well?"".",5,,23,
barrie_peter_pan," [they]_p2615 asked timidly, but [he]_p2616 answered with a hollow moan. ""He sighs,"". said [Smee]_n1079. ""He sighs again,"". said [Starkey]_n1080. ""And yet a third time [he]_p2617 sighs,"". said [Smee]_n1081. Then at last [he]_p2618 spoke passionately. ""The game's up,"". [he]_p2619 cried,.",3,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""those boys have found a mother. Affrighted though [she]_p2620 was, [Wendy]_n1082 swelled with pride. ""O evil day!"". cried [Starkey]_n1083. ""What's a mother?"". asked the ignorant [Smee]_n1084. [Wendy]_n1085 was so shocked that [she]_p2621 exclaimed. ""He doesn't know!"". and always after this [she]_p2622 felt that if [you]_p2623 could have a pet pirate [Smee]_n1086 would be [her]_p2624 one. [Peter]_n1087 pulled [her]_p2625 beneath the water, for [Hook]_n1088 had started up, crying,.",7,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""What was that?. ""I heard nothing,"". said [Starkey]_n1089 , raising the lantern over the waters, and as the pirates looked [they]_p2626 saw a strange sight. [It]_p2627 was the nest [I]_p2628 have told [you]_p2629 of, floating on the lagoon, and the [Never]_n1090 bird was sitting on it. ""See,"". said [Hook]_n1091 in answer to [Smee]_n1092 's question,. ""that is a mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the mother desert [her]_p2630 eggs? No. There was a break in [his]_p2631 voice, as if for a moment [he]_p2633 recalled innocent days when, but [he]_p2634 brushed away this weakness with [his]_p2632 hook. [Smee]_n1093 , much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but the more suspicious [Starkey]_n1094 said,.",6,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""If [she]_p2635 is a mother, perhaps [she]_p2636 is hanging about here to help [Peter]_n1095. [Hook]_n1096 winced. ""Ay,"". [he]_p2637 said,. ""that is the fear that haunts me. [He]_p2638 was roused from this dejection by [Smee]_n1097 's eager voice. ""[Captain]_n1098 ,"". said [Smee]_n1099 ,. ""could [we]_p2639 not kidnap these boys' mother and make [her]_p2640 [our]_p2641 mother?. ""It is a princely scheme,"".",5,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," cried [Hook]_n1100 , and at once [it]_p2642 took practical shape in [his]_p2643 great brain. ""We will seize the children and carry [them]_p2644 to the boat: the boys [we]_p2645 will make walk the plank, and [Wendy]_n1101 shall be [our]_p2646 mother. Again [Wendy]_n1102 forgot herself. ""[Never]_n1103 !"". [she]_p2647 cried, and bobbed. ""What was that?   But [they]_p2648 could see nothing. [They]_p2649 thought [it]_p2650 must have been a leaf in the wind. ""Do [you]_p2651 agree, [my]_p2652 bullies?"". asked [Hook]_n1104. ""There is [my]_p2653 hand on it,"".",5,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [they]_p2654 both said. ""And there is [my]_p2655 hook. [Swear]_n1105. [They]_p2656 all swore. By this time [they]_p2657 were on the rock, and suddenly [Hook]_n1106 remembered [Tiger Lily]_n1107. ""Where is the redskin?"". [he]_p2658 demanded abruptly. [He]_p2659 had a playful humour at moments, and [they]_p2660 thought this was one of the moments. ""That is all right, captain,"". [Smee]_n1108 answered complacently.",4,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," ""we let [her]_p2661 go. ""Let [her]_p2662 go!"". cried [Hook]_n1109. "" Twas [your]_p2663 own orders,"". the bo'sun faltered. ""You called over the water to [us]_p2664 to let [her]_p2665 go,"". said [Starkey]_n1110. ""[Brimstone]_n1111 and gall,"". thundered [Hook]_n1112 ,. ""what cozening [cheating] is going on here!"".",4,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," [His]_p2666 face had gone black with rage, but [he]_p2667 saw that [they]_p2669 believed [their]_p2670 words, and [he]_p2668 was startled. ""Lads,"". [he]_p2671 said, shaking a little,. ""I gave no such order. ""It is passing queer,"". [Smee]_n1113 said, and [they]_p2672 all fidgeted uncomfortably. [Hook]_n1114 raised [his]_p2673 voice, but there was a quiver in it. ""Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon [to-night]_n1115 ,"". [he]_p2674 cried,. ""dost hear me? Of course [Peter]_n1116 should have kept quiet, but of course [he]_p2675 did not.",4,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p2676 immediately answered in [Hook]_n1117 's voice:. ""Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, [I]_p2677 hear you. In that supreme moment [Hook]_n1118 did not blanch, even at the gills, but [Smee]_n1119 and [Starkey]_n1120 clung to each other in terror. ""Who are you, stranger? Speak!"". [Hook]_n1121 demanded. ""I am [James Hook]_n1122 ,"". replied the voice,. ""captain of the JOLLY [ROGER]_n1123. ""You are not [you]_p2678 are not,"". [Hook]_n1124 cried hoarsely.",8,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Brimstone]_n1125 and gall,"". the voice retorted,. ""say that again, and I'll cast anchor in you. [Hook]_n1126 tried a more ingratiating manner. ""If [you]_p2679 are [Hook]_n1127 ,"". [he]_p2680 said almost humbly,. ""come tell me, who am I?. ""A codfish,"". replied the voice,. ""only a codfish.",3,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," ""A codfish!"". [Hook]_n1128 echoed blankly, and [it]_p2681 was then, but not till then, that [his]_p2682 proud spirit broke. [He]_p2683 saw [his]_p2684 men draw back from him. ""Have [we]_p2685 been captained all this time by a codfish!"". [they]_p2686 muttered. ""It is lowering to [our]_p2687 pride. [They]_p2688 were [his]_p2689 dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though [he]_p2690 had become, [he]_p2691 scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence [it]_p2692 was not [their]_p2694 belief in [him]_p2695 that [he]_p2696 needed, [it]_p2693 was [his]_p2697 own. [He]_p2698 felt [his]_p2699 ego slipping from him. ""Don't desert me, bully,"".",1,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p2700 whispered hoarsely to it. In [his]_p2701 dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the great pirates, and [it]_p2702 sometimes gave [him]_p2703 intuitions. Suddenly [he]_p2704 tried the guessing game. ""[Hook]_n1129 ,"". [he]_p2705 called,. ""have [you]_p2706 another voice? Now [Peter]_n1130 could never resist a game, and [he]_p2707 answered blithely in [his]_p2708 own voice,. ""I have. ""And another name?. ""Ay, ay. ""Vegetable?"".",2,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," asked [Hook]_n1131. ""No. ""[Mineral]_n1132 ?. ""No. ""[Animal]_n1133 ?. ""Yes. ""Man?. ""No!"". This answer rang out scornfully. ""[Boy]_n1134 ?.",4,,0,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes. ""Ordinary boy?. ""No!. ""Wonderful boy? To [Wendy]_n1135 's pain the answer that rang out this time was. ""Yes. ""Are [you]_p2709 in [England]_n1136 ?. ""No. ""Are [you]_p2710 here?. ""Yes. [Hook]_n1137 was completely puzzled.",3,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," ""You ask [him]_p2711 some questions,"". [he]_p2712 said to the others, wiping [his]_p2713 damp brow. [Smee]_n1138 reflected. ""I can't think of a thing,"". [he]_p2714 said regretfully. ""Can't guess, can't guess!"". crowed [Peter]_n1139. ""Do [you]_p2715 give [it]_p2716 up?   Of course in [his]_p2717 pride [he]_p2718 was carrying the game too far, and the miscreants [villains] saw [their]_p2719 chance. ""Yes, yes,"". [they]_p2720 answered eagerly.",2,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Well, then,"". [he]_p2721 cried,. ""I am [Peter Pan]_n1140. [Pan]_n1141 ! In a moment [Hook]_n1142 was [himself]_p2722 again, and [Smee]_n1143 and [Starkey]_n1144 were [his]_p2723 faithful henchmen. ""Now [we]_p2724 have him,"". [Hook]_n1145 shouted. ""Into the water, [Smee]_n1146. [Starkey]_n1147 , mind the boat. Take [him]_p2725 dead or alive! [He]_p2726 leaped as [he]_p2727 spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of [Peter]_n1148. ""Are [you]_p2728 ready, boys?.",9,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay, ay,"". from various parts of the lagoon. ""Then lam into the pirates. The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was [John]_n1149 , who gallantly climbed into the boat and held [Starkey]_n1150. There was fierce struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate's grasp. [He]_p2729 wriggled overboard and [John]_n1151 leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away. Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at [their]_p2730 own side.",3,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," The corkscrew of [Smee]_n1152 got [Tootles]_n1153 in the fourth rib, but [he]_p2731 was [himself]_p2732 pinked [nicked] in turn by [Curly]_n1154. [Farther]_n1155 from the rock [Starkey]_n1156 was pressing [Slightly]_n1157 and the twins hard. Where all this time was [Peter]_n1158 ? [He]_p2733 was seeking bigger game. The others were all brave boys, and [they]_p2734 must not be blamed for backing from the pirate captain. [His]_p2735 iron claw made a circle of dead water round him, from which [they]_p2736 fled like affrighted fishes. But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter that circle. Strangely, [it]_p2737 was not in the water that [they]_p2738 met. [Hook]_n1159 rose to the rock to breathe, and at the same moment [Peter]_n1160 scaled [it]_p2739 on the opposite side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and [they]_p2740 had to crawl rather than climb. Neither knew that the other was coming.",9,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," Each feeling for a grip met the other's arm: in surprise [they]_p2741 raised [their]_p2743 heads [their]_p2744 faces were almost touching so [they]_p2742 met. Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before [they]_p2745 fell to [began combat] [they]_p2746 had a sinking [feeling in the stomach]. Had [it]_p2747 been so with [Peter]_n1161 at that moment [I]_p2749 would admit it. After all, [he]_p2750 was the only man that the [Sea-Cook]_n1162 had feared. But [Peter]_n1163 had no sinking, [he]_p2751 had one feeling only, gladness and [he]_p2752 gnashed [his]_p2753 pretty teeth with joy. [Quick]_n1164 as thought [he]_p2754 snatched a knife from [Hook]_n1165 's belt and was about to drive [it]_p2757 home, when [he]_p2755 saw that [he]_p2755 was higher up the rock than [his]_p2758 foe. [It]_p2759 would not have been fighting fair. [He]_p2760 gave the pirate a hand to help [him]_p2761 up. [It]_p2762 was then that [Hook]_n1166 bit him. Not the pain of this but [its]_p2763 unfairness was what dazed [Peter]_n1167.",7,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p2764 made [him]_p2765 quite helpless. [He]_p2766 could only stare, horrified. Every child is affected thus the first time [he]_p2767 is treated unfairly. All [he]_p2768 thinks [he]_p2769 has a right to when [he]_p2769 comes to [you]_p2771 to be [yours]_p2772 is fairness. After [you]_p2773 have been unfair to [him]_p2775 [he]_p2776 will love [you]_p2774 again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first unfairness no one except [Peter]_n1168. [He]_p2777 often met it, but [he]_p2778 always forgot it. [I]_p2779 suppose that was the real difference between [him]_p2780 and all the rest. So when [he]_p2781 met [it]_p2783 now [it]_p2784 was like the first time and [he]_p2782 could just stare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.",1,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," A few moments afterwards the other boys saw [Hook]_n1169 in the water striking wildly for the ship no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering but now [they]_p2785 were uneasy, for [they]_p2786 had lost both [Peter]_n1170 and [Wendy]_n1171 , and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling [them]_p2787 by name. [They]_p2789 found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting. ""[Peter]_n1172 , [Wendy]_n1173 "". as [they]_p2790 went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids. ""They must be swimming back or flying,"". the boys concluded. [They]_p2791 were not very anxious, because [they]_p2792 had such faith in [Peter]_n1174. [They]_p2793 chuckled, [boylike]_n1175 , because [they]_p2794 would be late for bed and [it]_p2795 was all mother [Wendy]_n1176 's fault! When [their]_p2796 voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a feeble cry. ""Help, help!   Two small figures were beating against the rock the girl had fainted and lay on the boy's arm.",8,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," With a last effort [Peter]_n1177 pulled [her]_p2797 up the rock and then lay down beside her. Even as [he]_p2799 also fainted [he]_p2800 saw that the water was rising. [He]_p2801 knew that [they]_p2802 would soon be drowned, but [he]_p2803 could do no more. As [they]_p2804 lay side by side a mermaid caught [Wendy]_n1178 by the feet, and began pulling [her]_p2805 softly into the water. [Peter]_n1179 , feeling [her]_p2806 slip from him, woke with a start, and was just in time to draw [her]_p2807 back. But [he]_p2808 had to tell [her]_p2809 the truth. ""We are on the rock, [Wendy]_n1180 ,"". [he]_p2810 said,. ""but [it]_p2811 is growing smaller. Soon the water will be over it.",4,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p2812 did not understand even now. ""We must go,"". [she]_p2813 said, almost brightly. ""Yes,"". [he]_p2814 answered faintly. ""[Shall]_n1181 [we]_p2815 swim or fly, [Peter]_n1182 ? [He]_p2816 had to tell her. ""Do [you]_p2817 think [you]_p2818 could swim or fly as far as the island, [Wendy]_n1183 , without [my]_p2819 help? [She]_p2820 had to admit that [she]_p2821 was too tired. [He]_p2822 moaned. ""What is it?"". [she]_p2823 asked, anxious about [him]_p2824 at once.",3,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I can't help you, [Wendy]_n1184. [Hook]_n1185 wounded me. [I]_p2825 can neither fly nor swim. ""Do [you]_p2826 mean [we]_p2827 shall both be drowned?. ""Look how the water is rising. [They]_p2828 put [their]_p2829 hands over [their]_p2830 eyes to shut out the sight. [They]_p2831 thought [they]_p2832 would soon be no more. As [they]_p2833 sat thus something brushed against [Peter]_n1186 as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly,. ""Can [I]_p2834 be of any use? [It]_p2835 was the tail of a kite, which [Michael]_n1187 had made some days before. [It]_p2836 had torn [itself]_p2837 out of [his]_p2838 hand and floated away.",4,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Michael]_n1188 's kite,"". [Peter]_n1189 said without interest, but next moment [he]_p2839 had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him. ""It lifted [Michael]_n1190 off the ground,"". [he]_p2840 cried. ""why should [it]_p2841 not carry you?. ""Both of us!. ""It can't lift two [Michael]_n1191 and [Curly]_n1192 tried. ""Let [us]_p2842 draw lots,"". [Wendy]_n1193 said bravely. ""And [you]_p2843 a [lady]_n1194 never.",7,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," "". Already [he]_p2844 had tied the tail round her. [She]_p2845 clung to [him]_p2846 [she]_p2848 refused to go without [him]_p2847 but with a. ""Good-bye, [Wendy]_n1195 ,"". [he]_p2849 pushed [her]_p2850 from the rock and in a few minutes [she]_p2851 was borne out of [his]_p2852 sight. [Peter]_n1196 was alone on the lagoon. The rock was very small now soon [it]_p2853 would be submerged. Pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling to the moon. [Peter]_n1197 was not quite like other boys but [he]_p2854 was afraid at last. A tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and [Peter]_n1198 felt just the one.",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [Next]_n1199 moment [he]_p2855 was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on [his]_p2856 face and a drum beating within him. [It]_p2857 was saying,. ""To die will be an awfully big adventure. Chapter 9 THE NEVER BIRD The last sound [Peter]_n1200 heard before [he]_p2858 was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to [their]_p2859 bedchambers under the sea. [He]_p2860 was too far away to hear [their]_p2861 doors shut but every door in the coral caves where [they]_p2862 live rings a tiny bell when [it]_p2863 opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on the mainland), and [he]_p2864 heard the bells. Steadily the waters rose till [they]_p2865 were nibbling at [his]_p2867 feet and to pass the time until [they]_p2866 made [their]_p2868 final gulp, [he]_p2869 watched the only thing on the lagoon. [He]_p2870 thought [it]_p2871 was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long [it]_p2872 would take to drift [ashore]_n1201. Presently [he]_p2873 noticed as an odd thing that [it]_p2874 was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for [it]_p2875 was fighting the tide, and sometimes winning and when [it]_p2875 won, [Peter]_n1202 , always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping [it]_p2876 was such a gallant piece of paper. [It]_p2878 was not really a piece of paper [it]_p2879 was the [Never]_n1203 bird, making desperate efforts to reach [Peter]_n1204 on the nest. By working [her]_p2880 wings, in a way [she]_p2883 had learned since the nest fell into the water, [she]_p2884 was able to some extent to guide [her]_p2881 strange craft, but by the time [Peter]_n1205 recognised [her]_p2881 [she]_p2884 was very exhausted.",7,,31,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p2886 had come to save him, to give [him]_p2887 [her]_p2889 nest, though there were eggs in it. [I]_p2890 rather wonder at the bird, for though [he]_p2891 had been nice to her, [he]_p2892 had also sometimes tormented her. [I]_p2893 can suppose only that, like [Mrs Darling]_n1206 and the rest of them, [she]_p2894 was melted because [he]_p2895 had all [his]_p2896 first teeth. [She]_p2897 called out to [him]_p2898 what [she]_p2899 had come for, and [he]_p2901 called out to [her]_p2902 what [she]_p2900 was doing there but of course neither of [them]_p2903 understood the other's language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and [I]_p2904 wish for the moment [I]_p2905 could pretend that this were such a story, and say that [Peter]_n1207 replied intelligently to the [Never]_n1208 bird but truth is best, and [I]_p2905 want to tell [you]_p2907 only what really happened. Well, not only could [they]_p2908 not understand each other, but [they]_p2909 forgot [their]_p2910 manners. ""I, want, you, to, get, into, the, nest,"". the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible,. ""and, then, you, can, drift, [ashore]_n1209 , but, I, am, too, tired, to, bring, it, any, nearer, so, you, must, try to, swim, to, it. ""What are [you]_p2911 quacking about?"".",4,,25,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n1210 answered. ""Why don't [you]_p2912 let the nest drift as usual?. ""I, want, you, "". the bird said, and repeated [it]_p2913 all over. Then [Peter]_n1211 tried slow and distinct. ""What, are, you, quacking, about?"". and so on. The [Never]_n1212 bird became irritated [they]_p2914 have very short tempers. ""You dunderheaded little jay!"". [she]_p2915 screamed,.",3,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Why don't [you]_p2916 do as [I]_p2918 tell you? [Peter]_n1213 felt that [she]_p2919 was calling [him]_p2920 names, and at a venture [he]_p2921 retorted hotly:. ""So are you!   Then rather curiously [they]_p2922 both snapped out the same remark:. ""Shut up!. ""Shut up!   Nevertheless the bird was determined to save [him]_p2923 if [she]_p2924 could, and by one last mighty effort [she]_p2925 propelled the nest against the rock. Then up [she]_p2926 flew deserting [her]_p2927 eggs, so as to make [her]_p2928 meaning clear. Then at last [he]_p2929 understood, and clutched the nest and waved [his]_p2930 thanks to the bird as [she]_p2931 fluttered overhead. [It]_p2932 was not to receive [his]_p2933 thanks, however, that [she]_p2934 hung there in the sky [it]_p2935 was not even to watch [him]_p2937 get into the nest [it]_p2936 was to see what [he]_p2938 did with [her]_p2939 eggs. There were two large white eggs, and [Peter]_n1214 lifted [them]_p2940 up and reflected. The bird covered [her]_p2941 face with [her]_p2942 wings, so as not to see the last of [them]_p2943 but [she]_p2944 could not help peeping between the feathers. [I]_p2945 forget whether [I]_p2946 have told [you]_p2947 that there was a stave on the rock, driven into [it]_p2948 by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure.",2,,32,
barrie_peter_pan," The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon [them]_p2949 for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them. The stave was still there, and on [it]_p2951 [Starkey]_n1215 had hung [his]_p2952 hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. [Peter]_n1216 put the eggs into this hat and set [it]_p2953 on the lagoon. [It]_p2954 floated beautifully. The [Never]_n1217 bird saw at once what [he]_p2955 was up to, and screamed [her]_p2956 admiration of [him]_p2958 and, alas, [Peter]_n1218 crowed [his]_p2959 agreement with her. Then [he]_p2960 got into the nest, reared the stave in [it]_p2961 as a mast, and hung up [his]_p2962 shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on [her]_p2963 eggs. [She]_p2964 drifted in one direction, and [he]_p2965 was borne off in another, both cheering. Of course when [Peter]_n1219 landed [he]_p2966 beached [his]_p2967 barque [small ship, actually the [Never Bird]_n1220 's nest in this particular case in point] in a place where the bird would easily find [it]_p2968 but the hat was such a great success that [she]_p2969 abandoned the nest. [It]_p2970 drifted about till [it]_p2971 went to pieces, and often [Starkey]_n1221 came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on [his]_p2972 hat.",7,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," As [we]_p2973 shall not see [her]_p2974 again, [it]_p2975 may be worth mentioning here that all [Never]_n1222 birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing. [Great]_n1223 were the rejoicings when [Peter]_n1224 reached the home under the ground almost as soon as [Wendy]_n1225 , who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that [they]_p2976 were several hours late for bed. This so inflated [them]_p2977 that [they]_p2979 did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages but [Wendy]_n1226 , though glorying in having [them]_p2978 all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried,. ""To bed, to bed,"". in a voice that had to be obeyed. [Next]_n1227 day, however, [she]_p2980 was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and [they]_p2981 played till bed-time at limping about and carrying [their]_p2982 arms in slings. Chapter 10 THE [HAPPY]_n1228 HOME [One]_n1229 important result of the brush [with the pirates] on the lagoon was that [it]_p2983 made the redskins [their]_p2984 friends. [Peter]_n1230 had saved [Tiger Lily]_n1231 from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing [she]_p2985 and [her]_p2986 braves would not do for him. All night [they]_p2987 sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed.",10,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," Even by day [they]_p2988 hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if [they]_p2989 wanted tit-bits to eat. [They]_p2990 called [Peter]_n1232 the [Great White Father]_n1233 , prostrating [themselves]_p2991 [lying down] before [him]_p2992 and [he]_p2994 liked this tremendously, so that [it]_p2995 was not really good for him. ""The great white father,"". [he]_p2996 would say to [them]_p2997 in a very lordly manner, as [they]_p2998 grovelled at [his]_p2999 feet,. ""is glad to see the [Piccaninny]_n1234 warriors protecting [his]_p3000 wigwam from the pirates. ""Me [Tiger Lily]_n1235 ,"". that lovely creature would reply. ""[Peter Pan]_n1236 save me, [me]_p3001 [his]_p3003 velly nice friend. [Me]_p3004 no let pirates hurt him. [She]_p3005 was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but [Peter]_n1237 thought [it]_p3006 [his]_p3007 due, and [he]_p3008 would answer condescendingly,.",6,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""It is good. [Peter Pan]_n1238 has spoken. Always when [he]_p3009 said,. ""[Peter Pan]_n1239 has spoken,"". [it]_p3010 meant that [they]_p3012 must now shut up, and [they]_p3013 accepted [it]_p3011 humbly in that spirit but [they]_p3013 were by no means so respectful to the other boys, whom [they]_p3014 looked upon as just ordinary braves. [They]_p3016 said. ""[How-do]_n1240 ?"". to them, and things like that and what annoyed the boys was that [Peter]_n1241 seemed to think this all right. Secretly [Wendy]_n1242 sympathised with [them]_p3017 a little, but [she]_p3018 was far too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father. ""[Father]_n1243 knows best,"".",6,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p3019 always said, whatever [her]_p3020 private opinion must be. [Her]_p3021 private opinion was that the redskins should not call [her]_p3022 a squaw. [We]_p3023 have now reached the evening that was to be known among [them]_p3024 as the [Night]_n1244 of Nights, because of [its]_p3025 adventures and [their]_p3026 upshot. The day, as if quietly gathering [its]_p3027 forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in [their]_p3028 blankets were at [their]_p3029 posts above, while, below, the children were having [their]_p3029 evening meal all except [Peter]_n1245 , who had gone out to get the time. The way [you]_p3031 got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near [him]_p3032 till the clock struck. The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and [they]_p3033 sat around the board, guzzling in [their]_p3034 greed and really, what with [their]_p3035 chatter and recriminations, the noise, as [Wendy]_n1246 said, was positively deafening. To be sure, [she]_p3036 did not mind noise, but [she]_p3037 simply would not have [them]_p3038 grabbing things, and then excusing [themselves]_p3039 by saying that [Tootles]_n1247 had pushed [their]_p3040 elbow. There was a fixed rule that [they]_p3041 must never hit back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to [Wendy]_n1248 by raising the right arm politely and saying,. ""I complain of so-and-so "". but what usually happened was that [they]_p3042 forgot to do this or did [it]_p3043 too much.",5,,25,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Silence,"". cried [Wendy]_n1249 when for the twentieth time [she]_p3044 had told [them]_p3045 that [they]_p3046 were not all to speak at once. ""Is [your]_p3047 mug empty, [Slightly]_n1250 darling?. ""Not quite empty, [mummy]_n1251 ,"". [Slightly]_n1252 said, after looking into an imaginary mug. ""He hasn't even begun to drink [his]_p3048 milk,"". [Nibs]_n1253 interposed. This was telling, and [Slightly]_n1254 seized [his]_p3049 chance. ""I complain of [Nibs]_n1255 ,"". [he]_p3050 cried promptly.",7,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [John]_n1256 , however, had held up [his]_p3051 hand first. ""Well, [John]_n1257 ?. ""May [I]_p3052 sit in [Peter]_n1258 's chair, as [he]_p3053 is not here?. ""Sit in father's chair, [John]_n1259 !"". [Wendy]_n1260 was scandalised. ""Certainly not. ""He is not really [our]_p3054 father,"". [John]_n1261 answered. ""He didn't even know how a father does till [I]_p3055 showed him. This was grumbling.",6,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""We complain of [John]_n1262 ,"". cried the twins. [Tootles]_n1263 held up [his]_p3056 hand. [He]_p3057 was so much the humblest of them, indeed [he]_p3058 was the only humble one, that [Wendy]_n1264 was specially gentle with him. ""I don't suppose,"". [Tootles]_n1265 said diffidently [bashfully or timidly],. ""that [I]_p3059 could be father. ""No, [Tootles]_n1266. Once [Tootles]_n1267 began, which was not very often, [he]_p3060 had a silly way of going on. ""As [I]_p3061 can't be father,"".",6,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p3062 said heavily,. ""I don't suppose, [Michael]_n1268 , [you]_p3063 would let [me]_p3064 be baby?. ""No, [I]_p3065 won't,"". [Michael]_n1269 rapped out. [He]_p3066 was already in [his]_p3067 basket. ""As [I]_p3068 can't be baby,"". [Tootles]_n1270 said, getting heavier and heavier and heavier,. ""do [you]_p3069 think [I]_p3070 could be a twin?. ""No, indeed,"". replied the twins.",3,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""it's awfully difficult to be a twin. ""As [I]_p3071 can't be anything important,"". said [Tootles]_n1271 ,. ""would any of [you]_p3072 like to see [me]_p3073 do a trick?. ""No,"". [they]_p3074 all replied. Then at last [he]_p3075 stopped. ""I hadn't really any hope,"". [he]_p3076 said. The hateful telling broke out again.",1,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Slightly]_n1272 is coughing on the table. ""The twins began with cheese-cakes. ""[Curly]_n1273 is taking both butter and honey. ""[Nibs]_n1274 is speaking with [his]_p3077 mouth full. ""I complain of the twins. ""I complain of [Curly]_n1275. ""I complain of [Nibs]_n1276. ""Oh dear, oh dear,"". cried [Wendy]_n1277 ,. ""I'm sure [I]_p3078 sometimes think that spinsters are to be envied.",6,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p3080 told [them]_p3081 to clear away, and sat down to [her]_p3082 work-basket, a heavy load of stockings and every knee with a hole in [it]_p3083 as usual. ""[Wendy]_n1278 ,"". remonstrated [scolded] [Michael]_n1279 ,. ""I'm too big for a cradle. ""I must have somebody in a cradle,"". [she]_p3084 said almost tartly,. ""and [you]_p3085 are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a house. While [she]_p3086 sewed [they]_p3087 played around [her]_p3088 such a group of happy faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. [It]_p3089 had become a very familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but [we]_p3090 are looking on [it]_p3091 for the last time.",2,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," There was a step above, and [Wendy]_n1280 , [you]_p3092 may be sure, was the first to recognize it. ""Children, [I]_p3093 hear [your]_p3094 father's step. [He]_p3095 likes [you]_p3096 to meet [him]_p3097 at the door. Above, the redskins crouched before [Peter]_n1281. ""Watch well, braves. [I]_p3098 have spoken. And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged [him]_p3099 from [his]_p3100 tree. As so often before, but never again. [He]_p3101 had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for [Wendy]_n1282. ""[Peter]_n1283 , [you]_p3102 just spoil them, [you]_p3103 know,"".",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [Wendy]_n1284 simpered [exaggerated a smile]. ""Ah, old [lady]_n1285 ,"". said [Peter]_n1286 , hanging up [his]_p3104 gun. ""It was [me]_p3105 told [him]_p3106 mothers are called old [lady]_n1287 ,"". [Michael]_n1288 whispered to [Curly]_n1289. ""I complain of [Michael]_n1290 ,"". said [Curly]_n1291 instantly. The first twin came to [Peter]_n1292. ""[Father]_n1293 , [we]_p3107 want to dance. ""Dance away, [my]_p3108 little man,"".",10,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Peter]_n1294 , who was in high good humour. ""But [we]_p3109 want [you]_p3110 to dance. [Peter]_n1295 was really the best dancer among them, but [he]_p3111 pretended to be scandalised. ""Me! [My]_p3112 old bones would rattle!. ""And [mummy]_n1296 too. ""What,"". cried [Wendy]_n1297 ,. ""the mother of such an armful, dance!. ""But on a [Saturday]_n1298 night,"". [Slightly]_n1299 insinuated.",6,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p3113 was not really [Saturday]_n1300 night, at least [it]_p3114 may have been, for [they]_p3116 had long lost count of the days but always if [they]_p3117 wanted to do anything special [they]_p3117 said this was [Saturday]_n1301 night, and then [they]_p3118 did it. ""Of course [it]_p3120 is [Saturday]_n1302 night, [Peter]_n1303 ,"". [Wendy]_n1304 said, relenting. ""People of [our]_p3121 figure, [Wendy]_n1305 !. ""But [it]_p3122 is only among [our]_p3123 own progeny [children]. ""True, true. So [they]_p3124 were told [they]_p3125 could dance, but [they]_p3125 must put on [their]_p3127 nighties first. ""Ah, old [lady]_n1306 ,"". [Peter]_n1307 said aside to [Wendy]_n1308 , warming [himself]_p3128 by the fire and looking down at [her]_p3129 as [she]_p3130 sat turning a heel,. ""there is nothing more pleasant of an evening for [you]_p3131 and [me]_p3132 when the day's toil is over than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.",9,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""It is sweet, [Peter]_n1309 , isn't it?"". [Wendy]_n1310 said, frightfully gratified. ""[Peter]_n1311 , [I]_p3133 think [Curly]_n1312 has [your]_p3134 nose. ""[Michael]_n1313 takes after you. [She]_p3135 went to [him]_p3136 and put [her]_p3137 hand on [his]_p3138 shoulder. ""[Dear Peter]_n1314 ,"". [she]_p3139 said,. ""with such a large family, of course, [I]_p3140 have now passed [my]_p3141 best, but [you]_p3142 don't want to [ex]change me, do you?. ""No, [Wendy]_n1315. Certainly [he]_p3144 did not want a change, but [he]_p3145 looked at [her]_p3147 uncomfortably, blinking, [you]_p3148 know, like one not sure whether [he]_p3145 was awake or [asleep]_n1316.",8,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Peter]_n1317 , what is it?. ""I was just thinking,"". [he]_p3149 said, a little scared. ""It is only make-believe, isn't it, that [I]_p3150 am [their]_p3151 father?. ""Oh yes,"". [Wendy]_n1318 said primly [formally and properly]. ""You see,"". [he]_p3152 continued apologetically,. ""it would make [me]_p3153 seem so old to be [their]_p3154 real father. ""But [they]_p3155 are ours, [Peter]_n1319 , [yours]_p3156 and mine.",3,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""But not really, [Wendy]_n1320 ?"". [he]_p3157 asked anxiously. ""Not if [you]_p3158 don't wish it,"". [she]_p3159 replied and [she]_p3160 distinctly heard [his]_p3161 sigh of relief. ""[Peter]_n1321 ,"". [she]_p3162 asked, trying to speak firmly,. ""what are [your]_p3163 exact feelings to [about] me?. ""Those of a devoted son, [Wendy]_n1322. ""I thought so,"". [she]_p3164 said, and went and sat by [herself]_p3165 at the extreme end of the room.",3,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""You are so queer,"". [he]_p3166 said, frankly puzzled,. ""and [Tiger Lily]_n1323 is just the same. There is something [she]_p3167 wants to be to me, but [she]_p3168 says [it]_p3169 is not [my]_p3170 mother. ""No, indeed, [it]_p3171 is not,"". [Wendy]_n1324 replied with frightful emphasis. Now [we]_p3172 know why [she]_p3173 was prejudiced against the redskins. ""Then what is it?. ""It isn't for a [lady]_n1325 to tell. ""Oh, very well,"".",3,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n1326 said, a little nettled. ""Perhaps [Tinker Bell]_n1327 will tell me. ""Oh yes, [Tinker Bell]_n1328 will tell you,"". [Wendy]_n1329 retorted scornfully. ""She is an abandoned little creature. Here [Tink]_n1330 , who was in [her]_p3174 bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something impudent. ""She says [she]_p3175 glories in being abandoned,"". [Peter]_n1331 interpreted. [He]_p3176 had a sudden idea. ""Perhaps [Tink]_n1332 wants to be [my]_p3177 mother?.",7,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""You silly ass!"". cried [Tinker Bell]_n1333 in a passion. [She]_p3178 had said [it]_p3179 so often that [Wendy]_n1334 needed no translation. ""I almost agree with her,"". [Wendy]_n1335 snapped. Fancy [Wendy]_n1336 snapping! But [she]_p3180 had been much tried, and [she]_p3181 little knew what was to happen before the night was out. If [she]_p3182 had known [she]_p3183 would not have snapped. None of [them]_p3184 knew. Perhaps [it]_p3185 was best not to know. [Their]_p3186 ignorance gave [them]_p3187 one more glad hour and as [it]_p3188 was to be [their]_p3190 last hour on the island, let [us]_p3191 rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it.",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p3192 sang and danced in [their]_p3193 night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song [it]_p3194 was, in which [they]_p3195 pretended to be frightened at [their]_p3197 own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom [they]_p3196 would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the dance, and how [they]_p3198 buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! [It]_p3202 was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when [it]_p3200 was finished, the pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that [they]_p3199 may never meet again. The stories [they]_p3203 told, before [it]_p3204 was time for [Wendy]_n1337 's good-night story! Even [Slightly]_n1338 tried to tell a story that night, but the beginning was so fearfully dull that [it]_p3205 appalled not only the others but himself, and [he]_p3206 said gloomily:. ""Yes, [it]_p3207 is a dull beginning. [I]_p3208 say, let [us]_p3209 pretend that [it]_p3210 is the end. And then at last [they]_p3211 all got into bed for [Wendy]_n1339 's story, the story [they]_p3212 loved best, the story [Peter]_n1340 hated. Usually when [she]_p3213 began to tell this story [he]_p3214 left the room or put [his]_p3216 hands over [his]_p3217 ears and possibly if [he]_p3215 had done either of those things this time [they]_p3218 might all still be on the island. But [to-night]_n1341 [he]_p3219 remained on [his]_p3220 stool and [we]_p3221 shall see what happened. Chapter 11 [WENDY]_n1342 'S STORY.",6,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Listen]_n1343 , then,"". said [Wendy]_n1344 , settling down to [her]_p3222 story, with [Michael]_n1345 at [her]_p3223 feet and seven boys in the bed. ""There was once a gentleman,. ""I had rather [he]_p3224 had been a [lady]_n1346 ,"". [Curly]_n1347 said. ""I wish [he]_p3225 had been a white rat,"". said [Nibs]_n1348. ""[Quiet]_n1349 ,"".

""They were married, [you]_p3239 know,"". explained [Wendy]_n1363 ,. ""and what do [you]_p3240 think [they]_p3241 had?. ""White rats,"". cried [Nibs]_n1364 , inspired.

""Do [you]_p3264 like a mother's love, [Nibs]_n1389 ?. ""I do just,"". said [Nibs]_n1390 , hitting back. ""You see,"". [Wendy]_n1391 said complacently,. ""our heroine knew that the mother would always leave the window open for [her]_p3265 children to fly back by so [they]_p3266 stayed away for years and had a lovely time.",6,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Did [they]_p3267 ever go back?. ""Let [us]_p3268 now,"". said [Wendy]_n1392 , bracing [herself]_p3269 up for [her]_p3270 finest effort,. ""take a peep into the future "". and [they]_p3271 all gave [themselves]_p3272 the twist that makes peeps into the future easier. ""Years have rolled by, and who is this elegant [lady]_n1393 of uncertain age alighting at [London Station]_n1394 ?. ""O [Wendy]_n1395 , who is she?"". cried [Nibs]_n1396 , every bit as excited as if [he]_p3273 didn't know. ""Can [it]_p3274 be, yes, no, [it]_p3275 is, the fair [Wendy]_n1397 !. ""Oh!.",6,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown to man's estate? Can [they]_p3276 be [John]_n1398 and [Michael]_n1399 ? [They]_p3277 are!. ""Oh!. "" See, dear brothers,' says [Wendy]_n1400 pointing upwards, there is the window still standing open. Ah, now [we]_p3278 are rewarded for [our]_p3279 sublime faith in a mother's love. ' So up [they]_p3280 flew to [their]_p3281 [mummy]_n1401 and daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which [we]_p3282 draw a veil. That was the story, and [they]_p3283 were as pleased with [it]_p3284 as the fair narrator herself. Everything just as [it]_p3285 should be, [you]_p3286 see. Off [we]_p3287 skip like the most heartless things in the world, which is what children are, but so attractive and [we]_p3288 have an entirely selfish time, and then when [we]_p3288 have need of special attention [we]_p3289 nobly return for it, confident that [we]_p3289 shall be rewarded instead of smacked. So great indeed was [their]_p3292 faith in a mother's love that [they]_p3293 felt [they]_p3294 could afford to be callous for a bit longer. But there was one there who knew better, and when [Wendy]_n1402 finished [he]_p3295 uttered a hollow groan.",5,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," ""What is it, [Peter]_n1403 ?"". [she]_p3296 cried, running to him, thinking [he]_p3297 was ill. [She]_p3298 felt [him]_p3299 solicitously, lower down than [his]_p3300 chest. ""Where is it, [Peter]_n1404 ?. ""It isn't that kind of pain,"". [Peter]_n1405 replied darkly. ""Then what kind is it?. ""[Wendy]_n1406 , [you]_p3301 are wrong about mothers. [They]_p3302 all gathered round [him]_p3303 in affright, so alarming was [his]_p3304 agitation  and with a fine candour [he]_p3305 told [them]_p3307 what [he]_p3306 had hitherto concealed. ""Long ago,"".",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p3308 said,. ""I thought like [you]_p3311 that [my]_p3312 mother would always keep the window open for me, so [I]_p3309 stayed away for moons and moons and moons, and then flew back but the window was barred, for mother had forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in [my]_p3313 bed. [I]_p3314 am not sure that this was true, but [Peter]_n1407 thought [it]_p3315 was true and [it]_p3316 scared them. ""Are [you]_p3317 sure mothers are like that?. ""Yes. So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!  Still [it]_p3318 is best to be careful and no one knows so quickly as a child when [he]_p3319 should give in. ""[Wendy]_n1408 , let [us]_p3320 [let's] go home,"". cried [John]_n1409 and [Michael]_n1410 together. ""Yes,"".",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p3321 said, clutching them. ""Not [to-night]_n1411 ?"". asked the lost boys bewildered. [They]_p3322 knew in what [they]_p3323 called [their]_p3324 hearts that [one]_p3325 can get on quite well without a mother, and that [it]_p3326 is only the mothers who think [you]_p3327 can't. ""At once,"". [Wendy]_n1412 replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come to her:. ""Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time. This dread made [her]_p3328 forgetful of what must be [Peter]_n1413 's feelings, and [she]_p3329 said to [him]_p3330 rather sharply,. ""[Peter]_n1414 , will [you]_p3331 make the necessary arrangements?. ""If [you]_p3332 wish it,"".",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p3333 replied, as coolly as if [she]_p3334 had asked [him]_p3335 to pass the nuts. Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If [she]_p3336 did not mind the parting, [he]_p3337 was going to show her, was [Peter]_n1415 , that neither did he. But of course [he]_p3339 cared very much and [he]_p3340 was so full of wrath against grown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as [he]_p3340 got inside [his]_p3343 tree [he]_p3341 breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate of about five to a second. [He]_p3344 did this because there is a saying in the [Neverland]_n1416 that, every time [you]_p3345 breathe, a grown-up dies and Peter was killing [them]_p3346 off vindictively as fast as possible. Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins [he]_p3347 returned to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in [his]_p3348 absence. Panic-stricken at the thought of losing [Wendy]_n1417 the lost boys had advanced upon [her]_p3349 threateningly. ""It will be worse than before [she]_p3350 came,"". [they]_p3351 cried. ""We shan't let [her]_p3352 go. ""Let's keep [her]_p3353 prisoner.",3,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay, chain [her]_p3354 up. In [her]_p3355 extremity an instinct told [her]_p3356 to which of [them]_p3357 to turn. ""[Tootles]_n1418 ,"". [she]_p3358 cried,. ""I appeal to you. Was [it]_p3359 not strange? [She]_p3360 appealed to [Tootles]_n1419 , quite the silliest one. Grandly, however, did [Tootles]_n1420 respond. For that one moment [he]_p3361 dropped [his]_p3362 silliness and spoke with dignity. ""I am just [Tootles]_n1421 ,"". [he]_p3363 said,.",4,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""and nobody minds me. But the first who does not behave to [Wendy]_n1422 like an [English]_n1423 gentleman [I]_p3364 will blood [him]_p3365 severely. [He]_p3366 drew back [his]_p3367 hanger and for that instant [his]_p3368 sun was at noon. The others held back uneasily. Then [Peter]_n1424 returned, and [they]_p3369 saw at once that [they]_p3370 would get no support from him. [He]_p3371 would keep no girl in the [Neverland]_n1425 against [her]_p3372 will. ""[Wendy]_n1426 ,"". [he]_p3373 said, striding up and down,. ""I have asked the redskins to guide [you]_p3374 through the wood, as flying tires [you]_p3375 so. ""Thank you, [Peter]_n1427.",6,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Then,"". [he]_p3376 continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be obeyed,. ""[Tinker Bell]_n1428 will take [you]_p3377 across the sea. Wake her, [Nibs]_n1429. [Nibs]_n1430 had to knock twice before [he]_p3378 got an answer, though [Tink]_n1431 had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time. ""Who are you? How dare you? Go away,"". [she]_p3379 cried. ""You are to get up, [Tink]_n1432 ,"". [Nibs]_n1433 called,. ""and take [Wendy]_n1434 on a journey.",7,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," Of course [Tink]_n1435 had been delighted to hear that [Wendy]_n1436 was going but [she]_p3380 was jolly well determined not to be [her]_p3382 courier, and [she]_p3381 said so in still more offensive language. Then [she]_p3383 pretended to be [asleep]_n1437 again. ""She says [she]_p3384 won't!"". [Nibs]_n1438 exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination, [whereupon Peter]_n1439 went sternly toward the young [lady]_n1440 's chamber. ""[Tink]_n1441 ,"". [he]_p3385 rapped out,. ""if [you]_p3386 don't get up and dress at once [I]_p3388 will open the curtains, and then [we]_p3389 shall all see [you]_p3387 in [your]_p3390 negligee [nightgown]. This made [her]_p3391 leap to the floor. ""Who said [I]_p3392 wasn't getting up?"". [she]_p3393 cried.",7,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at [Wendy]_n1442 , now equipped with [John]_n1443 and [Michael]_n1444 for the journey. By this time [they]_p3394 were dejected, not merely because [they]_p3395 were about to lose her, but also because [they]_p3395 felt that [she]_p3398 was going off to something nice to which [they]_p3396 had not been invited. [Novelty]_n1445 was beckoning to [them]_p3399 as usual. Crediting [them]_p3400 with a nobler feeling [Wendy]_n1446 melted. ""Dear ones,"". [she]_p3401 said,. ""if [you]_p3402 will all come with [me]_p3404 [I]_p3405 feel almost sure [I]_p3406 can get [my]_p3407 father and mother to adopt you. The invitation was meant specially for [Peter]_n1447 , but each of the boys was thinking exclusively of himself, and at once [they]_p3408 jumped with joy. ""But won't [they]_p3409 think [us]_p3410 rather a handful?"". [Nibs]_n1448 asked in the middle of [his]_p3411 jump.",7,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Oh no,"". said [Wendy]_n1449 , rapidly thinking [it]_p3412 out,. ""it will only mean having a few beds in the drawing-room [they]_p3413 can be hidden behind the screens on first Thursdays. ""[Peter]_n1450 , can [we]_p3414 go?"". [they]_p3415 all cried imploringly. [They]_p3416 took [it]_p3417 for granted that if [they]_p3418 went [he]_p3420 would go also, but really [they]_p3419 scarcely cared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert [their]_p3421 dearest ones. ""All right,"". [Peter]_n1451 replied with a bitter smile, and immediately [they]_p3422 rushed to get [their]_p3423 things. ""And now, [Peter]_n1452 ,"".",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [Wendy]_n1453 said, thinking [she]_p3424 had put everything right,. ""I am going to give [you]_p3425 [your]_p3427 medicine before [you]_p3426 go. "". [She]_p3428 loved to give [them]_p3429 medicine, and undoubtedly gave [them]_p3430 too much. Of course [it]_p3431 was only water, but [it]_p3432 was out of a bottle, and [she]_p3434 always shook the bottle and counted the drops, which gave [it]_p3432 a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion, however, [she]_p3435 did not give [Peter]_n1454 [his]_p3438 draught [portion], for just as [she]_p3436 had prepared it, [she]_p3436 saw a look on [his]_p3439 face that made [her]_p3440 heart sink. ""Get [your]_p3441 things, [Peter]_n1455 ,"". [she]_p3442 cried, shaking. ""No,"". [he]_p3443 answered, pretending indifference,.",3,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I am not going with you, [Wendy]_n1456. ""Yes, [Peter]_n1457. ""No. To show that [her]_p3444 departure would leave [him]_p3445 unmoved, [he]_p3446 skipped up and down the room, playing gaily on [his]_p3447 heartless pipes. [She]_p3448 had to run about after him, though [it]_p3449 was rather undignified. ""To find [your]_p3450 mother,"". [she]_p3451 coaxed. Now, if [Peter]_n1458 had ever quite had a mother, [he]_p3452 no longer missed her. [He]_p3453 could do very well without one. [He]_p3454 had thought [them]_p3455 out, and remembered only [their]_p3456 bad points.",3,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No, no,"". [he]_p3457 told [Wendy]_n1459 decisively. ""perhaps [she]_p3458 would say [I]_p3459 was old, and [I]_p3460 just want always to be a little boy and to have fun. ""But, [Peter]_n1460 ,. ""No. And so the others had to be told. ""[Peter]_n1461 isn't coming. [Peter]_n1462 not coming! [They]_p3461 gazed blankly at him, [their]_p3462 sticks over [their]_p3463 backs, and on each stick a bundle. [Their]_p3464 first thought was that if [Peter]_n1463 was not going [he]_p3465 had probably changed [his]_p3466 mind about letting [them]_p3467 go. But [he]_p3468 was far too proud for that.",5,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""If [you]_p3469 find [your]_p3470 mothers,"". [he]_p3471 said darkly,. ""I hope [you]_p3472 will like them. The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most of [them]_p3473 began to look rather doubtful. After all, [their]_p3474 faces said, were [they]_p3475 not noodles to want to go?. ""Now then,"". cried [Peter]_n1464 ,. ""no fuss, no blubbering good-bye, [Wendy]_n1465 "". and [he]_p3476 held out [his]_p3478 hand cheerily, quite as if [they]_p3479 must really go now, for [he]_p3477 had something important to do. [She]_p3480 had to take [his]_p3481 hand, and there was no indication that [he]_p3482 would prefer a thimble.",2,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," ""You will remember about changing [your]_p3483 flannels, [Peter]_n1466 ?"". [she]_p3484 said, lingering over him. [She]_p3485 was always so particular about [their]_p3486 flannels. ""Yes. ""And [you]_p3487 will take [your]_p3488 medicine?. ""Yes. That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. [Peter]_n1467 , however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. ""Are [you]_p3489 ready, [Tinker Bell]_n1468 ?"". [he]_p3490 called out.",3,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Ay, ay. ""Then lead the way. [Tink]_n1469 darted up the nearest tree but no one followed her, for [it]_p3491 was at this moment that the pirates made [their]_p3492 dreadful attack upon the redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. [Wendy]_n1470 fell on [her]_p3493 knees, but [her]_p3494 arms were extended toward [Peter]_n1471. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly blown in [his]_p3497 direction [they]_p3498 were beseeching [him]_p3495 mutely not to desert them. As for [Peter]_n1472 , [he]_p3499 seized [his]_p3502 sword, the same [he]_p3500 thought [he]_p3500 had slain [Barbecue]_n1473 with, and the lust of battle was in [his]_p3503 eye. Chapter 12 THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the unscrupulous [Hook]_n1474 had conducted [it]_p3504 improperly, for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.",6,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare [it]_p3505 is always the redskin who attacks, and with the wiliness of [his]_p3507 race [he]_p3508 does [it]_p3506 just before the dawn, at which time [he]_p3509 knows the courage of the whites to be at [its]_p3510 lowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for [it]_p3511 is destruction to be too far from water. There [they]_p3512 await the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching [their]_p3513 revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle, [snake-like]_n1475 , among the grass without stirring a blade. The brushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived. Not a sound is to be heard, save when [they]_p3514 give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves and some of [them]_p3515 do [it]_p3516 even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through [it]_p3518 for the first time but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching. That this was the usual procedure was so well known to [Hook]_n1476 that in disregarding [it]_p3519 [he]_p3520 cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance. The Piccaninnies, on [their]_p3521 part, trusted implicitly to [his]_p3523 honour, and [their]_p3522 whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.",2,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p3525 left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of [their]_p3526 tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair of civilised peoples, [they]_p3527 knew that the pirates were on the island from the moment one of [them]_p3528 trod on a dry stick and in an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where [Hook]_n1477 had landed [his]_p3529 forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing [their]_p3530 mocassins with the heels in front. [They]_p3531 found only one hillock with a stream at [its]_p3532 base, so that [Hook]_n1478 had no choice here [he]_p3533 must establish [himself]_p3534 and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded [their]_p3535 blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children's home, awaiting the cold moment when [they]_p3536 should deal pale death. Here dreaming, though [wide-awake]_n1479 , of the exquisite tortures to which [they]_p3537 were to put [him]_p3538 at break of day, those confiding savages were found by the treacherous [Hook]_n1480. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scouts as escaped the carnage, [he]_p3539 does not seem even to have paused at the rising ground, though [it]_p3543 is certain that in that grey light [he]_p3540 must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited [his]_p3545 subtle mind [he]_p3540 would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent on [he]_p3541 pounded with no policy but to fall to [get into combat]. What could the bewildered scouts do, masters as [they]_p3546 were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot helplessly after him, exposing [themselves]_p3548 fatally to view, while [they]_p3547 gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry. Around the brave [Tiger Lily]_n1481 were a dozen of [her]_p3549 stoutest warriors, and [they]_p3550 suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. [Fell]_n1482 from [their]_p3551 eyes then the film through which [they]_p3552 had looked at victory.",6,,27,
barrie_peter_pan," No more would [they]_p3553 torture at the stake. For [them]_p3554 the happy hunting-grounds was now. [They]_p3555 knew [it]_p3556 but as [their]_p3557 father's sons [they]_p3558 acquitted themselves. Even then [they]_p3559 had time to gather in a phalanx [dense formation] that would have been hard to break had [they]_p3560 risen quickly, but this [they]_p3560 were forbidden to do by the traditions of [their]_p3562 race. [It]_p3563 is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been to them, [they]_p3564 remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving as if the foe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, [they]_p3565 seized [their]_p3566 weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry but [it]_p3567 was now too late. [It]_p3568 is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the [Piccaninny]_n1483 tribe. Not all unavenged did [they]_p3569 die, for with [Lean Wolf]_n1484 fell [Alf Mason]_n1485 , to disturb the [Spanish Main]_n1486 no more, and among others who bit the dust were [Geo]_n1487.",5,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [Scourie]_n1488 , [Chas]_n1489. [Turley]_n1490 , and the [Alsatian Foggerty]_n1491. [Turley]_n1492 fell to the tomahawk of the terrible [Panther]_n1493 , who ultimately cut a way through the pirates with [Tiger Lily]_n1494 and a small remnant of the tribe. To what extent [Hook]_n1495 is to blame for [his]_p3570 tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide. Had [he]_p3571 waited on the rising ground till the proper hour [he]_p3572 and [his]_p3573 men would probably have been butchered and in judging [him]_p3574 [it]_p3575 is only fair to take this into account. What [he]_p3576 should perhaps have done was to acquaint [his]_p3578 opponents that [he]_p3577 proposed to follow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made [his]_p3579 strategy of no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties. [[One]_n1496 ]_p3580 cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme, and the fell [deadly] genius with which [it]_p3581 was carried out. What were [his]_p3582 own feelings about [himself]_p3585 at that triumphant moment? [Fain]_n1497 [gladly] would [his]_p3583 dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping [their]_p3586 cutlasses, [they]_p3588 gathered at a discreet distance from [his]_p3583 hook, and squinted through [their]_p3587 ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in [his]_p3589 heart, but [his]_p3590 face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, [he]_p3592 stood [aloof]_n1498 from [his]_p3590 followers in spirit as in substance.",11,,23,
barrie_peter_pan," The night's work was not yet over, for [it]_p3593 was not the redskins [he]_p3594 had come out to destroy [they]_p3596 were but the bees to be smoked, so that [he]_p3595 should get at the honey. [It]_p3597 was [Pan]_n1499 [he]_p3598 wanted, [Pan]_n1500 and [Wendy]_n1501 and [their]_p3599 band, but chi[efl]_n1502 y Pan. [Peter]_n1503 was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man's hatred of him. True [he]_p3600 had flung [Hook]_n1504 's arm to the crocodile, but even this and the increased insecurity of life to which [it]_p3601 led, owing to the crocodile's pertinacity [persistance], hardly account for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about [Peter]_n1505 which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. [It]_p3602 was not [his]_p3603 courage, [it]_p3605 was not [his]_p3604 engaging appearance, [it]_p3606 was not,. There is no beating about the bush, for [we]_p3607 know quite well what [it]_p3608 was, and have got to tell. [It]_p3609 was [Peter]_n1506 's cockiness. This had got on [Hook]_n1507 's nerves [it]_p3610 made [his]_p3612 iron claw twitch, and at night [it]_p3611 disturbed [him]_p3613 like an insect. While [Peter]_n1508 lived, the tortured man felt that [he]_p3614 was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.",10,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get [his]_p3615 dogs down? [He]_p3617 ran [his]_p3616 greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones. [They]_p3618 wriggled uncomfortably, for [they]_p3619 knew [he]_p3620 would not scruple [hesitate] to ram [them]_p3621 down with poles. In the meantime, what of the boys? [We]_p3622 have seen [them]_p3623 at the first clang of the weapons, turned as [it]_p3625 were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing with outstretched arms to [Peter]_n1509 and [we]_p3626 return to [them]_p3624 as [their]_p3627 mouths close, and [their]_p3628 arms fall to [their]_p3628 sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as [it]_p3630 arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind but [they]_p3632 know that in the passing [it]_p3631 has determined [their]_p3633 fate. Which side had won? The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the question put by every boy, and alas, [they]_p3634 also heard [Peter]_n1510 's answer. ""If the redskins have won,"". [he]_p3635 said,. ""they will beat the [tom-tom]_n1511 [it]_p3636 is always [their]_p3637 sign of victory. Now [Smee]_n1512 had found the [tom-tom]_n1513 , and was at that moment sitting on it. ""You will never hear the [tom-tom]_n1514 again,"".",6,,23,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p3638 muttered, but inaudibly of course, for strict silence had been enjoined [urged]. To [his]_p3639 amazement [Hook]_n1515 signed [him]_p3640 to beat the [tom-tom]_n1516 , and slowly there came to [Smee]_n1517 an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. [Never]_n1518 , probably, had this simple man admired [Hook]_n1519 so much. Twice [Smee]_n1520 beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully. ""The [tom-tom]_n1521 ,"". the miscreants heard [Peter]_n1522 cry. ""an Indian victory! The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above, and almost immediately [they]_p3641 repeated [their]_p3642 good-byes to [Peter]_n1523. This puzzled the pirates, but all [their]_p3643 other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. [They]_p3644 smirked at each other and rubbed [their]_p3645 hands. Rapidly and silently [Hook]_n1524 gave [his]_p3646 orders: one man to each tree, and the others to arrange [themselves]_p3647 in a line two yards apart.",10,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," Chapter 13 DO [YOU]_p3648 BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?  The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to emerge from [his]_p3649 tree was [Curly]_n1525. [He]_p3650 rose out of [it]_p3651 into the arms of [Cecco]_n1526 , who flung [him]_p3652 to [Smee]_n1527 , who flung [him]_p3653 to [Starkey]_n1528 , who flung [him]_p3653 to [Bill Jukes]_n1529 , who flung [him]_p3654 to [Noodler]_n1530 , and so [he]_p3656 was tossed from one to another till [he]_p3657 fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys were plucked from [their]_p3658 trees in this ruthless manner and several of [them]_p3659 were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to hand. A different treatment was accorded to [Wendy]_n1531 , who came last. With ironical politeness [Hook]_n1532 raised [his]_p3660 hat to her, and, offering [her]_p3662 [his]_p3661 arm, escorted [her]_p3663 to the spot where the others were being gagged. [He]_p3665 did [it]_p3666 with such an air, [he]_p3667 was so frightfully [DISTINGUE]_n1533 [imposingly distinguished], that [she]_p3668 was too fascinated to cry out. [She]_p3669 was only a little girl. Perhaps [it]_p3670 is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment [Hook]_n1534 entranced her, and [we]_p3674 tell on [her]_p3671 only because [her]_p3672 slip led to strange results. Had [she]_p3675 haughtily unhanded [him]_p3677 (and [we]_p3678 should have loved to write [it]_p3679 of her), [she]_p3676 would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then [Hook]_n1535 would probably not have been present at the tying of the children and had [he]_p3680 not been at the tying [he]_p3681 would not have discovered [Slightly]_n1536 's secret, and without the secret [he]_p3681 could not presently have made [his]_p3683 foul attempt on [Peter]_n1537 's life.",13,,34,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p3684 were tied to prevent [their]_p3685 flying away, doubled up with [their]_p3686 knees close to [their]_p3686 ears and for the trussing of [them]_p3688 the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until [Slightly]_n1538 's turn came, when [he]_p3689 was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags [ends] with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked [him]_p3690 in [their]_p3691 rage, just as [you]_p3693 kick the parcel (though in fairness [you]_p3694 should kick the string) and strange to say [it]_p3695 was [Hook]_n1539 who told [them]_p3696 to belay [their]_p3692 violence. [His]_p3697 lip was curled with malicious triumph. While [his]_p3698 dogs were merely sweating because every time [they]_p3700 tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part [he]_p3701 bulged out in another, [Hook]_n1540 's master mind had gone far beneath [Slightly]_n1541 's surface, probing not for effects but for causes and [his]_p3699 exultation showed that [he]_p3702 had found them. [Slightly]_n1542 , white to the gills, knew that [Hook]_n1543 had surprised [discovered] [his]_p3703 secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick. [Poor]_n1544 [Slightly]_n1545 , most wretched of all the children now, for [he]_p3704 was in a panic about [Peter]_n1546 , bitterly regretted what [he]_p3705 had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when [he]_p3706 was hot, [he]_p3707 had swelled in consequence to [his]_p3709 present girth, and instead of reducing [himself]_p3712 to fit [his]_p3710 tree [he]_p3707 had, unknown to the others, whittled [his]_p3710 tree to make [it]_p3713 fit him. Sufficient of this [Hook]_n1547 guessed to persuade [him]_p3714 that [Peter]_n1548 at last lay at [his]_p3715 mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean caverns of [his]_p3716 mind crossed [his]_p3716 lips [he]_p3718 merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that [he]_p3719 would be alone. How to convey them? Hunched up in [their]_p3720 ropes [they]_p3721 might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass.",11,,38,
barrie_peter_pan," Again [Hook]_n1549 's genius surmounted difficulties. [He]_p3722 indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised [it]_p3723 on [their]_p3725 shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood. [I]_p3726 don't know whether any of the children were crying if so, the singing drowned the sound but as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from [its]_p3727 chimney as if defying [Hook]_n1550. [Hook]_n1551 saw it, and [it]_p3728 did [Peter]_n1552 a bad service. [It]_p3730 dried up any trickle of pity for [him]_p3731 that may have remained in the pirate's infuriated breast. The first thing [he]_p3732 did on finding [himself]_p3733 alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to [Slightly]_n1553 's tree, and make sure that [it]_p3734 provided [him]_p3735 with a passage. Then for long [he]_p3736 remained brooding [his]_p3737 hat of ill omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through [his]_p3738 hair. [Dark]_n1554 as were [his]_p3739 thoughts [his]_p3740 blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently [he]_p3741 listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent below as above the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void.",6,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," Was that boy [asleep]_n1555 , or did [he]_p3742 stand waiting at the foot of [Slightly]_n1556 's tree, with [his]_p3743 dagger in [his]_p3744 hand? There was no way of knowing, save by going down. [Hook]_n1557 let [his]_p3745 cloak slip softly to the ground, and then biting [his]_p3746 lips till a lewd blood stood on them, [he]_p3747 stepped into the tree. [He]_p3748 was a brave man, but for a moment [he]_p3749 had to stop there and wipe [his]_p3750 brow, which was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, [he]_p3751 let [himself]_p3752 go into the unknown. [He]_p3753 arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting at [his]_p3754 breath, which had almost left him. As [his]_p3755 eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape but the only one on which [his]_p3756 greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay [Peter]_n1558 fast [asleep]_n1559. [Unaware]_n1560 of the tragedy being enacted above, [Peter]_n1561 had continued, for a little time after the children left, to play gaily on [his]_p3757 pipes: no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to [himself]_p3758 that [he]_p3759 did not care. Then [he]_p3760 decided not to take [his]_p3761 medicine, so as to grieve [Wendy]_n1562. Then [he]_p3762 lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex [her]_p3763 still more for [she]_p3764 had always tucked [them]_p3765 inside it, because [you]_p3766 never know that [you]_p3767 may not grow chilly at the turn of the night.",8,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," Then [he]_p3768 nearly cried but [it]_p3771 struck [him]_p3773 how indignant [she]_p3774 would be if [he]_p3769 laughed instead so [he]_p3769 laughed a haughty laugh and fell [asleep]_n1563 in the middle of it. Sometimes, though not often, [he]_p3775 had dreams, and [they]_p3776 were more painful than the dreams of other boys. For hours [he]_p3777 could not be separated from these dreams, though [he]_p3778 wailed piteously in them. [They]_p3779 had to do, [I]_p3780 think, with the riddle of [his]_p3781 existence. At such times [it]_p3782 had been [Wendy]_n1564 's custom to take [him]_p3783 out of bed and sit with [him]_p3784 on [her]_p3788 lap, soothing [him]_p3784 in dear ways of [her]_p3789 own invention, and when [he]_p3790 grew calmer to put [him]_p3785 back to bed before [he]_p3791 quite woke up, so that [he]_p3791 should not know of the indignity to which [she]_p3793 had subjected him. But on this occasion [he]_p3794 had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. [One]_n1565 arm dropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of [his]_p3795 laugh was stranded on [his]_p3796 mouth, which was open, showing the little pearls. Thus defenceless [Hook]_n1566 found him. [He]_p3797 stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at [his]_p3798 enemy. Did no feeling of compassion disturb [his]_p3799 sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil [he]_p3800 loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was [himself]_p3802 no mean performer on the harpsichord) and, let [it]_p3803 be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred [him]_p3804 profoundly.",4,,34,
barrie_peter_pan," Mastered by [his]_p3805 better self [he]_p3806 would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing. What stayed [him]_p3807 was [Peter]_n1567 's impertinent appearance as [he]_p3808 slept. The open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: [they]_p3809 were such a personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to [their]_p3810 offensiveness. [They]_p3811 steeled [Hook]_n1568 's heart. If [his]_p3812 rage had broken [him]_p3813 into a hundred pieces every one of [them]_p3814 would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper. Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, [Hook]_n1569 stood in darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward [he]_p3815 discovered an obstacle, the door of [Slightly]_n1570 's tree. [It]_p3816 did not entirely fill the aperture, and [he]_p3817 had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, [he]_p3818 found to [his]_p3819 fury that [it]_p3821 was low down, beyond [his]_p3820 reach. To [his]_p3822 disordered brain [it]_p3823 seemed then that the irritating quality in [Peter]_n1571 's face and figure visibly increased, and [he]_p3825 rattled the door and flung [himself]_p3826 against it. Was [his]_p3827 enemy to escape [him]_p3829 after all? But what was that? The red in [his]_p3828 eye had caught sight of [Peter]_n1572 's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach.",6,,24,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p3830 fathomed what [it]_p3831 was straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in [his]_p3832 power. Lest [he]_p3833 should be taken alive, [Hook]_n1573 always carried about [his]_p3834 person a dreadful drug, blended by [himself]_p3836 of all the death-dealing rings that had come into [his]_p3835 possession. These [he]_p3837 had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence. Five drops of this [he]_p3838 now added to [Peter]_n1574 's cup. [His]_p3839 hand shook, but [it]_p3840 was in exultation rather than in shame. As [he]_p3841 did [it]_p3843 [he]_p3842 avoided glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve [him]_p3844 merely to avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look [he]_p3845 cast upon [his]_p3846 victim, and turning, wormed [his]_p3847 way with difficulty up the tree. As [he]_p3848 emerged at the top [he]_p3849 looked the very spirit of evil breaking from [its]_p3850 hole. Donning [his]_p3851 hat at [its]_p3854 most rakish angle, [he]_p3855 wound [his]_p3852 cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal [his]_p3852 person from the night, of which [it]_p3856 was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself, stole away through the trees. [Peter]_n1575 slept on.",3,,27,
barrie_peter_pan," The light guttered [burned to edges] and went out, leaving the tenement in darkness but still [he]_p3857 slept. [It]_p3858 must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when [he]_p3859 suddenly sat up in [his]_p3861 bed, wakened by [he]_p3860 knew not what. [It]_p3862 was a soft cautious tapping on the door of [his]_p3863 tree. Soft and cautious, but in that stillness [it]_p3864 was sinister. [Peter]_n1576 felt for [his]_p3865 dagger till [his]_p3866 hand gripped it. Then [he]_p3867 spoke. ""Who is that?   For long there was no answer: then again the knock. ""Who are you?   No answer. [He]_p3868 was thrilled, and [he]_p3869 loved being thrilled. In two strides [he]_p3870 reached the door.",1,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," Unlike [Slightly]_n1577 's door, [it]_p3871 filled the aperture [opening], so that [he]_p3873 could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him. ""I won't open unless [you]_p3874 speak,"". [Peter]_n1578 cried. Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice. ""Let [me]_p3875 in, [Peter]_n1579. [It]_p3876 was [Tink]_n1580 , and quickly [he]_p3877 unbarred to her. [She]_p3878 flew in excitedly, [her]_p3879 face flushed and [her]_p3880 dress stained with mud. ""What is it?. ""Oh, [you]_p3881 could never guess!"". [she]_p3882 cried, and offered [him]_p3883 three guesses.",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Out with it!"". [he]_p3884 shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers [magicians] pull from [their]_p3885 mouths, [she]_p3886 told of the capture of [Wendy]_n1581 and the boys. [Peter]_n1582 's heart bobbed up and down as [he]_p3887 listened. [Wendy]_n1583 bound, and on the pirate ship [she]_p3888 who loved everything to be just so!. ""I'll rescue her!"". [he]_p3889 cried, leaping at [his]_p3890 weapons. As [he]_p3891 leapt [he]_p3892 thought of something [he]_p3892 could do to please her. [He]_p3894 could take [his]_p3895 medicine. [His]_p3896 hand closed on the fatal draught. ""No!"".",3,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," shrieked [Tinker Bell]_n1584 , who had heard [Hook]_n1585 mutter about [his]_p3897 deed as [he]_p3898 sped through the forest. ""Why not?. ""It is poisoned. ""Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?. ""[Hook]_n1586. ""Don't be silly. How could [Hook]_n1587 have got down here? Alas, [Tinker Bell]_n1588 could not explain this, for even [she]_p3899 did not know the dark secret of Slightly's tree. Nevertheless [Hook]_n1589 's words had left no room for doubt. The cup was poisoned. ""Besides,"".",6,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Peter]_n1590 , quite believing himself,. ""I never fell [asleep]_n1591. [He]_p3900 raised the cup. No time for words now time for deeds and with one of [her]_p3901 lightning movements [Tink]_n1592 got between [his]_p3902 lips and the draught, and drained [it]_p3903 to the dregs. ""Why, [Tink]_n1593 , how dare [you]_p3904 drink [my]_p3905 medicine? But [she]_p3906 did not answer. Already [she]_p3907 was reeling in the air. ""What is the matter with you?"". cried [Peter]_n1594 , suddenly afraid. ""It was poisoned, [Peter]_n1595 ,"". [she]_p3908 told [him]_p3909 softly.",6,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""and now [I]_p3910 am going to be dead. ""[O Tink]_n1596 , did [you]_p3911 drink [it]_p3912 to save me?. ""Yes. ""But why, [Tink]_n1597 ? [Her]_p3913 wings would scarcely carry [her]_p3914 now, but in reply [she]_p3915 alighted on [his]_p3916 shoulder and gave [his]_p3917 nose a loving bite. [She]_p3918 whispered in [his]_p3919 ear. ""You silly ass,"". and then, tottering to [her]_p3920 chamber, lay down on the bed. [His]_p3921 head almost filled the fourth wall of [her]_p3922 little room as [he]_p3924 knelt near [her]_p3923 in distress. Every moment [her]_p3925 light was growing fainter and [he]_p3926 knew that if [it]_p3927 went out [she]_p3928 would be no more. [She]_p3929 liked [his]_p3930 tears so much that [she]_p3931 put out [her]_p3932 beautiful finger and let [them]_p3933 run over it.",2,,24,
barrie_peter_pan," [Her]_p3934 voice was so low that at first [he]_p3935 could not make out what [she]_p3936 said. Then [he]_p3937 made [it]_p3938 out. [She]_p3939 was saying that [she]_p3940 thought [she]_p3941 could get well again if children believed in fairies. [Peter]_n1598 flung out [his]_p3942 arms. There were no children there, and [it]_p3943 was night time but [he]_p3944 addressed all who might be dreaming of the [Neverland]_n1599 , and who were therefore nearer to [him]_p3945 than [you]_p3946 think: boys and girls in [their]_p3947 nighties, and naked papooses in [their]_p3948 baskets hung from trees. ""Do [you]_p3949 believe?"". [he]_p3950 cried. [Tink]_n1600 sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to [her]_p3951 fate. [She]_p3952 fancied [she]_p3953 heard answers in the affirmative, and then again [she]_p3954 wasn't sure. ""What do [you]_p3955 think?"".",3,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p3956 asked [Peter]_n1601. ""If [you]_p3957 believe,"". [he]_p3958 shouted to them,. ""clap [your]_p3959 hands don't let [Tink]_n1602 die. Many clapped. Some didn't. A few beasts hissed. The clapping stopped suddenly as if countless mothers had rushed to [their]_p3960 nurseries to see what on earth was happening but already [Tink]_n1603 was saved. First [her]_p3961 voice grew strong, then [she]_p3962 popped out of bed, then [she]_p3963 was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever. [She]_p3964 never thought of thanking those who believed, but [she]_p3965 would have liked to get at the ones who had hissed.",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""And now to rescue [Wendy]_n1604 ! The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when [Peter]_n1605 rose from [his]_p3966 tree, begirt [belted] with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon [his]_p3967 perilous quest. [It]_p3968 was not such a night as [he]_p3969 would have chosen. [He]_p3970 had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape [his]_p3971 eyes but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing [his]_p3972 shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that [he]_p3973 was [astir]_n1606. [He]_p3974 regretted now that [he]_p3975 had given the birds of the island such strange names that [they]_p3976 are very wild and difficult of approach. There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which happily [he]_p3977 was an adept [expert]. But in what direction, for [he]_p3978 could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a space [Nature]_n1607 stood still in horror of the recent carnage. [He]_p3979 had taught the children something of the forest lore that [he]_p3980 had [himself]_p3981 learned from [Tiger Lily]_n1608 and [Tinker Bell]_n1609 , and knew that in [their]_p3982 dire hour [they]_p3983 were not likely to forget it. [Slightly]_n1610 , if [he]_p3984 had an opportunity, would blaze [cut a mark in] the trees, for instance, [Curly]_n1611 would drop seeds, and [Wendy]_n1612 would leave [her]_p3985 handkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and [he]_p3986 could not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.",9,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not a movement and yet [he]_p3989 knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, or stalking [him]_p3987 from behind. [He]_p3990 swore this terrible oath:. ""[Hook]_n1613 or [me]_p3991 this time. Now [he]_p3992 crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, [he]_p3993 darted across a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on [his]_p3994 lip and [his]_p3995 dagger at the ready. [He]_p3996 was frightfully happy. Chapter 14 THE [PIRATE]_n1614 SHIP [One]_n1615 green light squinting over [Kidd]_n1616 's [Creek]_n1617 , which is near the mouth of the pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY [ROGER]_n1618 , lay, low in the water a rakish-looking [speedy-looking] craft foul to the hull, every beam in [her]_p3997 detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. [She]_p3998 was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for [she]_p3999 floated immune in the horror of [her]_p4000 name. [She]_p4001 was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from [her]_p4002 could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable save the whir of the ship's sewing machine at which [Smee]_n1619 sat, ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic [Smee]_n1620. [I]_p4003 know not why [he]_p4004 was so infinitely pathetic, unless [it]_p4007 were because [he]_p4005 was so pathetically unaware of [it]_p4008 but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings [he]_p4005 had touched the fount of [Hook]_n1621 's tears and made [it]_p4008 flow.",9,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," Of this, as of almost everything else, [Smee]_n1622 was quite unconscious. A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma [putrid mist] of the night others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where even in [their]_p4010 sleep [they]_p4011 rolled skillfully to this side or that out of [Hook]_n1623 's reach, lest [he]_p4012 should claw [them]_p4013 mechanically in passing. [Hook]_n1624 trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. [It]_p4014 was [his]_p4015 hour of triumph. [Peter]_n1625 had been removed for ever from [his]_p4016 path, and all the other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. [It]_p4017 was [his]_p4018 grimmest deed since the days when [he]_p4022 had brought [Barbecue]_n1626 to heel and knowing as [we]_p4024 do how vain a tabernacle is man, could [we]_p4025 be surprised had [he]_p4023 now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of [his]_p4019 success? But there was no elation in [his]_p4019 gait, which kept pace with the action of [his]_p4020 sombre mind. [Hook]_n1627 was profoundly dejected. [He]_p4026 was often thus when communing with [himself]_p4027 on board ship in the quietude of the night. [It]_p4028 was because [he]_p4029 was so terribly alone.",6,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by [his]_p4030 dogs. [They]_p4031 were socially inferior to him. [Hook]_n1628 was not [his]_p4032 true name. To reveal who [he]_p4033 really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed, [he]_p4034 had been at a famous public school  and [its]_p4035 traditions still clung to [him]_p4036 like garments, with which indeed [they]_p4037 are largely concerned. Thus [it]_p4038 was offensive to [him]_p4039 even now to board a ship in the same dress in which [he]_p4040 grappled [attacked] her, and [he]_p4041 still adhered in [his]_p4042 walk to the school's distinguished slouch. But above all [he]_p4043 retained the passion for good form. Good form! However much [he]_p4044 may have degenerated, [he]_p4045 still knew that this is all that really matters. From far within [him]_p4046 [he]_p4047 heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through [them]_p4048 came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when [one]_p4049 cannot sleep. ""Have [you]_p4050 been good form [to-day]_n1629 ?"". was [their]_p4051 eternal question.",2,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, [it]_p4052 is mine,"". [he]_p4053 cried. ""Is [it]_p4054 quite good form to be distinguished at anything?"". the tap-tap from [his]_p4055 school replied. ""I am the only man whom [Barbecue]_n1630 feared,"". [he]_p4056 urged,. ""and [Flint]_n1631 feared [Barbecue]_n1632. ""[Barbecue]_n1633 , [Flint]_n1634 , what house?"". came the cutting retort. Most disquieting reflection of all, was [it]_p4057 not bad form to think about good form?  [His]_p4058 vitals were tortured by this problem.",5,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p4059 was a claw within [him]_p4060 sharper than the iron one and as [it]_p4062 tore him, the perspiration dripped down [his]_p4063 tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked [his]_p4064 doublet. Ofttimes [he]_p4065 drew [his]_p4066 sleeve across [his]_p4067 face, but there was no damming that trickle. Ah, envy not [Hook]_n1635. There came to [him]_p4068 a presentiment of [his]_p4069 early dissolution [death]. [It]_p4070 was as if [Peter]_n1636 's terrible oath had boarded the ship. [Hook]_n1637 felt a gloomy desire to make [his]_p4071 dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for it. ""Better for [Hook]_n1638 ,"". [he]_p4072 cried,. ""if [he]_p4073 had had less ambition!"". [It]_p4074 was in [his]_p4075 darkest hours only that [he]_p4076 referred to [himself]_p4077 in the third person.",4,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No little children to love me!   Strange that [he]_p4078 should think of this, which had never troubled [him]_p4079 before perhaps the sewing machine brought [it]_p4080 to [his]_p4081 mind. For long [he]_p4082 muttered to himself, staring at [Smee]_n1639 , who was hemming placidly, under the conviction that all children feared him. Feared him! Feared [Smee]_n1640 ! There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him. [He]_p4083 had said horrid things to [them]_p4084 and hit [them]_p4085 with the palm of [his]_p4086 hand, because [he]_p4088 could not hit with [his]_p4087 fist, but [they]_p4089 had only clung to [him]_p4090 the more. [Michael]_n1641 had tried on [his]_p4091 spectacles. To tell poor [Smee]_n1642 that [they]_p4092 thought [him]_p4093 lovable! [Hook]_n1643 itched to do it, but [it]_p4094 seemed too brutal. Instead, [he]_p4096 revolved this mystery in [his]_p4098 mind: why do [they]_p4099 find [Smee]_n1644 lovable? [He]_p4100 pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that [he]_p4097 was. If [Smee]_n1645 was lovable, what was [it]_p4101 that made [him]_p4102 so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself,. ""Good form? Had the bo'sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of all? [He]_p4105 remembered that [you]_p4106 have to prove [you]_p4107 don't know [you]_p4107 have [it]_p4103 before [you]_p4108 are eligible for [Pop]_n1646 [an elite social club at [Eton]_n1647 ]. With a cry of rage [he]_p4110 raised [his]_p4112 iron hand over [Smee]_n1648 's head but [he]_p4111 did not tear.",10,,33,
barrie_peter_pan," What arrested [him]_p4113 was this reflection:. ""To claw a man because [he]_p4114 is good form, what would that be?. ""Bad form! The unhappy [Hook]_n1649 was as impotent [powerless] as [he]_p4115 was damp, and [he]_p4116 fell forward like a cut flower. [His]_p4117 dogs thinking [him]_p4118 out of the way for a time, discipline instantly relaxed and [they]_p4121 broke into a bacchanalian [drunken] dance, which brought [him]_p4119 to [his]_p4122 feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of water had passed over him. ""[Quiet]_n1650 , [you]_p4123 scugs,"". [he]_p4124 cried,. ""or I'll cast anchor in [you]_p4125 "". and at once the din was hushed. ""Are all the children chained, so that [they]_p4126 cannot fly away?. ""Ay, ay.",2,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Then hoist [them]_p4127 up. The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except [Wendy]_n1651 , and ranged in line in front of him. For a time [he]_p4128 seemed unconscious of [their]_p4129 presence. [He]_p4130 lolled at [his]_p4131 ease, humming, not unmelodiously, snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon the light from [his]_p4132 cigar gave a touch of colour to [his]_p4133 face. ""Now then, bullies,"". [he]_p4134 said briskly,. ""six of [you]_p4135 walk the plank [to-night]_n1652 , but [I]_p4136 have room for two cabin boys. Which of [you]_p4137 is [it]_p4138 to be?. ""Don't irritate [him]_p4139 unnecessarily,"".",2,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," had been [Wendy]_n1653 's instructions in the hold so [Tootles]_n1654 stepped forward politely. [Tootles]_n1655 hated the idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told [him]_p4140 that [it]_p4141 would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person and though a somewhat silly boy, [he]_p4142 knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise [them]_p4143 for it, but make constant use of it. So [Tootles]_n1656 explained prudently,. ""You see, sir, [I]_p4144 don't think [my]_p4145 mother would like [me]_p4146 to be a pirate. Would [your]_p4147 mother like [you]_p4148 to be a pirate, [Slightly]_n1657 ? [He]_p4149 winked at [Slightly]_n1658 , who said mournfully,. ""I don't think so,"". as if [he]_p4150 wished things had been otherwise. ""Would [your]_p4151 mother like [you]_p4152 to be a pirate, [Twin]_n1659 ?. ""I don't think so,"".",7,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," said the first twin, as clever as the others. ""[Nibs]_n1660 , would,. ""Stow this gab,"". roared [Hook]_n1661 , and the spokesmen were dragged back. ""You, boy,"". [he]_p4153 said, addressing [John]_n1662 ,. ""you look as if [you]_p4154 had a little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, [my]_p4157 hearty? Now [John]_n1663 had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep. and [he]_p4158 was struck by [Hook]_n1664 's picking [him]_p4159 out.",5,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I once thought of calling [myself]_p4160 [Red-handed Jack]_n1665 ,"". [he]_p4161 said diffidently. ""And a good name too. We'll call [you]_p4162 that here, bully, if [you]_p4163 join. ""What do [you]_p4164 think, [Michael]_n1666 ?"". asked [John]_n1667. ""What would [you]_p4165 call [me]_p4166 if [I]_p4167 join?"". [Michael]_n1668 demanded. ""[Blackbeard Joe]_n1669. [Michael]_n1670 was naturally impressed.",6,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""What do [you]_p4168 think, [John]_n1671 ?"". [He]_p4169 wanted [John]_n1672 to decide, and [John]_n1673 wanted [him]_p4170 to decide. ""[Shall]_n1674 [we]_p4171 still be respectful subjects of the [King]_n1675 ?"". [John]_n1676 inquired. Through [Hook]_n1677 's teeth came the answer:. ""You would have to swear, Down with the [King]_n1678. ' Perhaps [John]_n1679 had not behaved very well so far, but [he]_p4172 shone out now. ""Then [I]_p4173 refuse,"". [he]_p4174 cried, banging the barrel in front of [Hook]_n1680. ""And [I]_p4175 refuse,"".",10,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," cried [Michael]_n1681. ""[Rule Britannia]_n1682 !"". squeaked [Curly]_n1683. The infuriated pirates buffeted [them]_p4176 in the mouth and [Hook]_n1684 roared out,. ""That seals [your]_p4177 doom. [Bring]_n1685 up [their]_p4178 mother. Get the plank ready. [They]_p4179 were only boys, and [they]_p4180 went white as [they]_p4181 saw [Jukes]_n1686 and [Cecco]_n1687 preparing the fatal plank. But [they]_p4182 tried to look brave when [Wendy]_n1688 was brought up. No words of [mine]_p4183 can tell [you]_p4184 how [Wendy]_n1689 despised those pirates.",9,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling but all that [she]_p4185 saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which [you]_p4186 might not have written with [your]_p4187 finger. ""Dirty pig"". and [she]_p4188 had already written [it]_p4189 on several. But as the boys gathered round [her]_p4190 [she]_p4191 had no thought, of course, save for them. ""So, [my]_p4192 beauty,"". said [Hook]_n1690 , as if [he]_p4193 spoke in syrup,. ""you are to see [your]_p4194 children walk the plank. Fine gentlemen though [he]_p4195 was, the intensity of [his]_p4197 communings had soiled [his]_p4198 ruff, and suddenly [he]_p4196 knew that [she]_p4199 was gazing at it. With a hasty gesture [he]_p4200 tried to hide it, but [he]_p4201 was too late.",1,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Are [they]_p4202 to die?"". asked [Wendy]_n1691 , with a look of such frightful contempt that [he]_p4203 nearly fainted. ""They are,"". [he]_p4204 snarled. ""Silence all,"". [he]_p4205 called gloatingly,. ""for a mother's last words to [her]_p4206 children. At this moment [Wendy]_n1692 was grand. ""These are [my]_p4207 last words, dear boys,  [she]_p4208 said firmly. ""I feel that [I]_p4209 have a message to [you]_p4211 from [your]_p4212 real mothers, and [it]_p4213 is this: [We]_p4214 hope [our]_p4215 sons will die like [English]_n1693 gentlemen.",3,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," ' Even the pirates were awed, and [Tootles]_n1694 cried out hysterically,. ""I am going to do what [my]_p4216 mother hopes. What are [you]_p4217 to do, [Nibs]_n1695 ?. ""What [my]_p4218 mother hopes. What are [you]_p4219 to do, [Twin]_n1696 ?. ""What [my]_p4220 mother hopes. [John]_n1697 , what are, But [Hook]_n1698 had found [his]_p4221 voice again. ""Tie [her]_p4222 up!"". [he]_p4223 shouted. [It]_p4224 was [Smee]_n1699 who tied [her]_p4225 to the mast.",6,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""See here, honey,"". [he]_p4226 whispered,. ""I'll save [you]_p4227 if [you]_p4228 promise to be [my]_p4229 mother. But not even for [Smee]_n1700 would [she]_p4230 make such a promise. ""I would almost rather have no children at all,"". [she]_p4231 said disdainfully [scornfully]. [It]_p4232 is sad to know that not a boy was looking at [her]_p4233 as [Smee]_n1701 tied [her]_p4234 to the mast the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk [they]_p4235 were about to take. [They]_p4236 were no longer able to hope that [they]_p4237 would walk [it]_p4239 manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from [them]_p4240 [they]_p4238 could stare and shiver only. [Hook]_n1702 smiled on [them]_p4241 with [his]_p4242 teeth closed, and took a step toward [Wendy]_n1703. [His]_p4243 intention was to turn [her]_p4244 face so that [she]_p4245 should see the boys walking the plank one by one.",4,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," But [he]_p4246 never reached her, [he]_p4247 never heard the cry of anguish [he]_p4247 hoped to wring from her. [He]_p4249 heard something else instead. [It]_p4250 was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile. [They]_p4251 all heard it, pirates, boys, [Wendy]_n1704 and immediately every head was blown in one direction not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but toward [Hook]_n1705. All knew that what was about to happen concerned [him]_p4252 alone, and that from being actors [they]_p4253 were suddenly become spectators. Very frightful was [it]_p4254 to see the change that came over him. [It]_p4255 was as if [he]_p4256 had been clipped at every joint. [He]_p4257 fell in a little heap. The sound came steadily nearer and in advance of [it]_p4258 came this ghastly thought,. ""The crocodile is about to board the ship!   Even the iron claw hung inactive as if knowing that [it]_p4259 was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted.",2,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," Left so fearfully alone, any other man would have lain with [his]_p4260 eyes shut where [he]_p4261 fell: but the gigantic brain of [Hook]_n1706 was still working, and under [its]_p4264 guidance [he]_p4262 crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as [he]_p4262 could go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and [it]_p4265 was only when [he]_p4266 brought up against the bulwarks that [he]_p4267 spoke. ""[Hide]_n1707 me!"". [he]_p4268 cried hoarsely. [They]_p4269 gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard. [They]_p4270 had no thought of fighting it. [It]_p4271 was Fate. Only when [Hook]_n1708 was hidden from [them]_p4272 did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that [they]_p4273 could rush to the ship's side to see the crocodile climbing it. Then [they]_p4274 got the strangest surprise of the [Night]_n1709 of Nights for [it]_p4275 was no crocodile that was coming to [their]_p4276 aid. [It]_p4277 was [Peter]_n1710.",5,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p4278 signed to [them]_p4279 not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion. Then [he]_p4280 went on ticking. Chapter 15. ""HOOK OR [ME]_p4281 THIS TIME [Odd]_n1711 things happen to all of [us]_p4282 on [our]_p4283 way through life without [our]_p4284 noticing for a time that [they]_p4285 have happened. Thus, to take an instance, [we]_p4286 suddenly discover that [we]_p4287 have been deaf in one ear for [we]_p4287 don't know how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come that night to [Peter]_n1712. When last [we]_p4289 saw [him]_p4290 [he]_p4291 was stealing across the island with one finger to [his]_p4292 lips and [his]_p4293 dagger at the ready. [He]_p4294 had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by and by [he]_p4297 remembered that [it]_p4295 had not been ticking. At first [he]_p4298 thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down. Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of [its]_p4299 closest companion, [Peter]_n1713 began to consider how [he]_p4300 could turn the catastrophe to [his]_p4303 own use and [he]_p4301 decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe [he]_p4301 was the crocodile and let [him]_p4304 pass unmolested.",3,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p4305 ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound, and [it]_p4306 followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what [it]_p4307 had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that [it]_p4307 was again ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a fixed idea, [it]_p4308 was a stupid beast. [Peter]_n1714 reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, [his]_p4310 legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that [they]_p4311 had entered a new element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom [I]_p4312 know. As [he]_p4313 swam [he]_p4314 had but one thought:. ""[Hook]_n1715 or [me]_p4315 this time. "". [He]_p4316 had ticked so long that [he]_p4317 now went on ticking without knowing that [he]_p4318 was doing it. Had [he]_p4319 known [he]_p4320 would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him. On the contrary, [he]_p4321 thought [he]_p4322 had scaled [her]_p4325 side as noiseless as a mouse and [he]_p4322 was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with [Hook]_n1716 in [their]_p4326 midst as abject as if [he]_p4323 had heard the crocodile.",3,,22,
barrie_peter_pan," The crocodile! No sooner did [Peter]_n1717 remember [it]_p4327 than [he]_p4328 heard the ticking. At first [he]_p4329 thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and [he]_p4330 looked behind [him]_p4331 swiftly. Then [he]_p4332 realised that [he]_p4333 was doing [it]_p4335 himself, and in a flash [he]_p4333 understood the situation. ""How clever of me!  [he]_p4336 thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause. [It]_p4337 was at this moment that [Ed Teynte]_n1718 the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by [your]_p4338 watch. [Peter]_n1719 struck true and deep. [John]_n1720 clapped [his]_p4339 hands on the ill-fated pirate's mouth to stifle the dying groan. [He]_p4340 fell forward. Four boys caught [him]_p4341 to prevent the thud.",4,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n1721 gave the signal, and the carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How long has [it]_p4342 taken?. ""[One]_n1722 !"". ([Slightly]_n1723 had begun to count. ) None too soon, [Peter]_n1724 , every inch of [him]_p4343 on tiptoe, vanished into the cabin for more than one pirate was screwing up [his]_p4344 courage to look round. [They]_p4345 could hear each other's distressed breathing now, which showed [them]_p4346 that the more terrible sound had passed. ""It's gone, captain,"". [Smee]_n1725 said, wiping off [his]_p4347 spectacles. ""All's still again.",5,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," Slowly [Hook]_n1726 let [his]_p4348 head emerge from [his]_p4349 ruff, and listened so intently that [he]_p4350 could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound, and [he]_p4351 drew [himself]_p4352 up firmly to [his]_p4353 full height. ""Then here's to [Johnny Plank]_n1727 !"". [he]_p4354 cried brazenly, hating the boys more than ever because [they]_p4355 had seen [him]_p4356 unbend. [He]_p4357 broke into the villainous ditty:. ""Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank, [You]_p4358 walks along [it]_p4359 so, Till [it]_p4360 goes down and [you]_p4361 goes down To [Davy Jones]_n1728 below! To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of dignity, [he]_p4362 danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at [them]_p4366 as [he]_p4363 sang and when [he]_p4363 finished [he]_p4364 cried,. ""Do [you]_p4367 want a touch of the cat [o' nine tails] before [you]_p4368 walk the plank?   At that [they]_p4369 fell on [their]_p4370 knees. ""No, no!"". [they]_p4371 cried so piteously that every pirate smiled. ""Fetch the cat, [Jukes]_n1729 ,"".",4,,24,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Hook]_n1730. ""it's in the cabin. The cabin! [Peter]_n1731 was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other. ""Ay, ay,"". said [Jukes]_n1732 blithely, and [he]_p4372 strode into the cabin. [They]_p4373 followed [him]_p4374 with [their]_p4376 eyes [they]_p4377 scarce knew that [Hook]_n1733 had resumed [his]_p4378 song, [his]_p4379 dogs joining in with him:. ""Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat, [Its]_p4380 tails are nine, [you]_p4381 know, And when they're writ upon [your]_p4382 back,   What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. [It]_p4383 wailed through the ship, and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech. ""What was that?"".",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," cried [Hook]_n1734. ""Two,"". said [Slightly]_n1735 solemnly. The [Italian Cecco]_n1736 hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin. [He]_p4384 tottered out, haggard. ""What's the matter with [Bill Jukes]_n1737 , [you]_p4385 dog?"". hissed [Hook]_n1738 , towering over him. ""The matter wi' [him]_p4386 is he's dead, stabbed,"". replied [Cecco]_n1739 in a hollow voice. ""[Bill Jukes]_n1740 dead!"".",7,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," cried the startled pirates. ""The cabin's as black as a pit,"". [Cecco]_n1741 said, almost gibbering,. ""but there is something terrible in there: the thing [you]_p4387 heard crowing. The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were seen by [Hook]_n1742. ""[Cecco]_n1743 ,"". [he]_p4388 said in [his]_p4389 most steely voice,. ""go back and fetch [me]_p4390 out that doodle-doo. [Cecco]_n1744 , bravest of the brave, cowered before [his]_p4391 captain, crying. ""No, no"".",4,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," but [Hook]_n1745 was purring to [his]_p4392 claw. ""Did [you]_p4393 say [you]_p4394 would go, [Cecco]_n1746 ?"". [he]_p4395 said musingly. [Cecco]_n1747 went, first flinging [his]_p4396 arms despairingly. There was no more singing, all listened now and again came a death-screech and again a crow. No one spoke except [Slightly]_n1748. ""Three,"". [he]_p4397 said. [Hook]_n1749 rallied [his]_p4398 dogs with a gesture. "" S'death and odds fish,"".",5,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p4399 thundered,. ""who is to bring [me]_p4400 that doodle-doo?. ""Wait till [Cecco]_n1750 comes out,"". growled [Starkey]_n1751 , and the others took up the cry. ""I think [I]_p4401 heard [you]_p4403 volunteer, [Starkey]_n1752 ,"". said [Hook]_n1753 , purring again. ""No, by thunder!"". [Starkey]_n1754 cried. ""My hook thinks [you]_p4404 did,"". said [Hook]_n1755 , crossing to him.",6,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I wonder if [it]_p4405 would not be advisable, [Starkey]_n1756 , to humour the hook?. ""I'll swing before [I]_p4406 go in there,"". replied [Starkey]_n1757 doggedly, and again [he]_p4408 had the support of the crew. ""Is this mutiny?"". asked [Hook]_n1758 more pleasantly than ever. ""[Starkey]_n1759 's ringleader!. ""[Captain]_n1760 , mercy!"". [Starkey]_n1761 whimpered, all of a tremble now. ""[Shake]_n1762 hands, [Starkey]_n1763 ,"". said [Hook]_n1764 , proffering [his]_p4409 claw.",9,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," [Starkey]_n1765 looked round for help, but all deserted him. As [he]_p4410 backed up [Hook]_n1766 advanced, and now the red spark was in [his]_p4411 eye. With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon [Long Tom]_n1767 and precipitated [himself]_p4412 into the sea. ""Four,"". said [Slightly]_n1768. ""And now,"". [Hook]_n1769 said courteously,. ""did any other gentlemen say mutiny?  Seizing a lantern and raising [his]_p4413 claw with a menacing gesture,. ""I'll bring out that doodle-doo myself,"". [he]_p4414 said, and sped into the cabin.",5,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Five. "". How [Slightly]_n1770 longed to say it. [He]_p4415 wetted [his]_p4416 lips to be ready, but [Hook]_n1771 came staggering out, without [his]_p4417 lantern. ""Something blew out the light,"". [he]_p4418 said a little unsteadily. ""Something!"". echoed [Mullins]_n1772. ""What of [Cecco]_n1773 ?"". demanded [Noodler]_n1774.",5,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""He's as dead as [Jukes]_n1775 ,"". said [Hook]_n1776 shortly. [His]_p4419 reluctance to return to the cabin impressed [them]_p4420 all unfavourably, and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are superstitious, and [Cookson]_n1777 cried,. ""They do say the surest sign a ship's accurst is when there's one on board more than can be accounted for. ""I've heard,"". muttered [Mullins]_n1778 ,. ""he always boards the pirate craft last. Had [he]_p4421 a tail, captain?. ""They say,"".",4,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," said another, looking viciously at [Hook]_n1779 ,. ""that when [he]_p4422 comes it's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard. ""Had [he]_p4423 a hook, captain?"". asked [Cookson]_n1780 insolently and one after another took up the cry,. ""The ship's doomed!"". At this the children could not resist raising a cheer. [Hook]_n1781 had well-nigh forgotten [his]_p4424 prisoners, but as [he]_p4426 swung round on [them]_p4427 now [his]_p4425 face lit up again. ""Lads,"". [he]_p4428 cried to [his]_p4429 crew,. ""now here's a notion.",3,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," Open the cabin door and drive [them]_p4430 in. Let [them]_p4431 fight the doodle-doo for [their]_p4432 lives. If [they]_p4433 kill him, we're so much the better if [he]_p4434 kills them, we're none the worse. For the last time [his]_p4435 dogs admired [Hook]_n1782 , and devotedly [they]_p4437 did [his]_p4436 bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them. ""Now, listen!"". cried [Hook]_n1783 , and all listened. But not one dared to face the door. Yes, one, [Wendy]_n1784 , who all this time had been bound to the mast. [It]_p4438 was for neither a scream nor a crow that [she]_p4439 was watching, [it]_p4440 was for the reappearance of [Peter]_n1785.",4,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p4441 had not long to wait. In the cabin [he]_p4442 had found the thing for which [he]_p4443 had gone in search: the key that would free the children of [their]_p4444 manacles, and now [they]_p4445 all stole forth, armed with such weapons as [they]_p4446 could find. First signing [them]_p4447 to hide, [Peter]_n1786 cut [Wendy]_n1787 's bonds, and then nothing could have been easier than for [them]_p4448 all to fly off together but one thing barred the way, an oath,. ""[Hook]_n1788 or [me]_p4449 this time. So when [he]_p4450 had freed [Wendy]_n1789 , [he]_p4451 whispered for [her]_p4453 to conceal [herself]_p4457 with the others, and [himself]_p4458 took [her]_p4454 place by the mast, [her]_p4454 cloak around [him]_p4459 so that [he]_p4451 should pass for her. Then [he]_p4460 took a great breath and crowed. To the pirates [it]_p4461 was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin and [they]_p4462 were panic-stricken. [Hook]_n1790 tried to hearten [them]_p4463 but like the dogs [he]_p4466 had made [them]_p4464 [they]_p4469 showed [him]_p4471 [their]_p4473 fangs, and [he]_p4467 knew that if [he]_p4467 took [his]_p4474 eyes off [them]_p4464 now [they]_p4470 would leap at him. ""Lads,"". [he]_p4475 said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never quailing for an instant,.",5,,33,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I've thought [it]_p4476 out. There's a [Jonah]_n1791 aboard. ""Ay,"". [they]_p4477 snarled,. ""a man wi' a hook. ""No, lads, no, it's the girl. [Never]_n1792 was luck on a pirate ship wi' a woman on board. We'll right the ship when she's gone. Some of [them]_p4478 remembered that this had been a saying of [Flint]_n1793 's. ""It's worth trying,"".",3,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," [they]_p4479 said doubtfully. ""Fling the girl overboard,"". cried [Hook]_n1794 and [they]_p4480 made a rush at the figure in the cloak. ""There's none can save [you]_p4481 now, missy,"". [Mullins]_n1795 hissed jeeringly. ""There's one,"". replied the figure. ""Who's that?. ""[Peter Pan]_n1796 the avenger!"". came the terrible answer and as [he]_p4482 spoke [Peter]_n1797 flung off [his]_p4483 cloak.",4,,5,
barrie_peter_pan," Then [they]_p4484 all knew who twas that had been undoing [them]_p4485 in the cabin, and twice [Hook]_n1798 essayed to speak and twice [he]_p4486 failed. In that frightful moment [I]_p4487 think [his]_p4488 fierce heart broke. At last [he]_p4489 cried,. ""Cleave [him]_p4490 to the brisket!"". but without conviction. ""Down, boys, and at them!"". [Peter]_n1799 's voice rang out and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the pirates kept together [it]_p4491 is certain that [they]_p4492 would have won but the onset came when [they]_p4493 were still unstrung, and [they]_p4493 ran hither and thither, striking wildly, each thinking [himself]_p4495 the last survivor of the crew. Man to man [they]_p4496 were the stronger but [they]_p4497 fought on the defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose [their]_p4498 quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea others hid in dark recesses, where [they]_p4499 were found by [Slightly]_n1800 , who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which [he]_p4501 flashed in [their]_p4502 faces, so that [they]_p4500 were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys.",3,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and [Slightly]_n1801 monotonously counting, five, six, seven eight, nine, ten, eleven. [I]_p4503 think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded [Hook]_n1802 , who seemed to have a charmed life, as [he]_p4504 kept [them]_p4505 at bay in that circle of fire. [They]_p4506 had done for [his]_p4507 dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for [them]_p4508 all. Again and again [they]_p4509 closed upon him, and again and again [he]_p4510 hewed a clear space. [He]_p4511 had lifted up one boy with [his]_p4512 hook, and was using [him]_p4514 as a buckler [shield], when another, who had just passed [his]_p4513 sword through [Mullins]_n1803 , sprang into the fray. ""Put up [your]_p4515 swords, boys,"". cried the newcomer,. ""this man is mine. Thus suddenly [Hook]_n1804 found [himself]_p4516 face to face with [Peter]_n1805. The others drew back and formed a ring around them.",5,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," For long the two enemies looked at one another, [Hook]_n1806 shuddering slightly, and [Peter]_n1807 with the strange smile upon [his]_p4517 face. ""So, [Pan]_n1808 ,"". said [Hook]_n1809 at last,. ""this is all [your]_p4518 doing. ""Ay, [James Hook]_n1810 ,"". came the stern answer,. ""it is all [my]_p4519 doing. ""[Proud]_n1811 and insolent youth,"". said [Hook]_n1812 ,. ""prepare to meet thy doom.",7,,3,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Dark]_n1813 and sinister man,"". [Peter]_n1814 answered,. ""have at thee. Without more words [they]_p4520 fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to either blade. [Peter]_n1815 was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity ever and anon [he]_p4521 followed up a feint with a lunge that got past [his]_p4523 foe's defence, but [his]_p4524 shorter reach stood [him]_p4525 in ill stead, and [he]_p4522 could not drive the steel home. [Hook]_n1816 , scarcely [his]_p4526 inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced [him]_p4529 back by the weight of [his]_p4527 onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught [him]_p4530 long ago by [Barbecue]_n1817 at [Rio]_n1818 but to [his]_p4527 astonishment [he]_p4531 found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then [he]_p4532 sought to close and give the quietus with [his]_p4533 iron hook, which all this time had been pawing the air but [Peter]_n1819 doubled under [it]_p4534 and, lunging fiercely, pierced [him]_p4535 in the ribs. At the sight of [his]_p4536 own blood, whose peculiar colour, [you]_p4537 remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from [Hook]_n1820 's hand, and [he]_p4538 was at [Peter]_n1821 's mercy. ""Now!"". cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture [Peter]_n1822 invited [his]_p4539 opponent to pick up [his]_p4540 sword.",10,,21,
barrie_peter_pan," [Hook]_n1823 did so instantly, but with a tragic feeling that [Peter]_n1824 was showing good form. Hitherto [he]_p4541 had thought [it]_p4542 was some fiend fighting him, but darker suspicions assailed [him]_p4543 now. ""[Pan]_n1825 , who and what art thou?"". [he]_p4545 cried huskily. ""I'm youth, I'm joy,"". [Peter]_n1826 answered at a venture,. ""I'm a little bird that has broken out of the egg. This, of course, was nonsense but [it]_p4546 was proof to the unhappy [Hook]_n1827 that [Peter]_n1828 did not know in the least who or what [he]_p4547 was, which is the very pinnacle of good form. ""[To't]_n1829 again,"". [he]_p4548 cried despairingly.",7,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p4549 fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed [it]_p4550 but [Peter]_n1830 fluttered round [him]_p4552 as if the very wind [it]_p4551 made blew [him]_p4553 out of the danger zone. And again and again [he]_p4554 darted in and pricked. [Hook]_n1831 was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer asked for life but for one boon [it]_p4555 craved: to see [Peter]_n1832 show bad form before [it]_p4556 was cold forever. Abandoning the fight [he]_p4557 rushed into the powder magazine and fired it. ""In two minutes,"". [he]_p4558 cried,. ""the ship will be blown to pieces. Now, now, [he]_p4559 thought, true form will show. But [Peter]_n1833 issued from the powder magazine with the shell in [his]_p4560 hands, and calmly flung [it]_p4561 overboard.",4,,13,
barrie_peter_pan," What sort of form was [Hook]_n1834 [himself]_p4562 showing? Misguided man though [he]_p4563 was, [we]_p4565 may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end [he]_p4564 was true to the traditions of [his]_p4566 race. The other boys were flying around [him]_p4567 now, flouting, scornful and [he]_p4568 staggered about the deck striking up at [them]_p4569 impotently, [his]_p4571 mind was no longer with [them]_p4570 [it]_p4572 was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up [to the headmaster] for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And [his]_p4573 shoes were right, and [his]_p4574 waistcoat was right, and [his]_p4574 tie was right, and [his]_p4575 socks were right. [James Hook]_n1835 , thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell. For [we]_p4577 have come to [his]_p4578 last moment. Seeing [Peter]_n1836 slowly advancing upon [him]_p4579 through the air with dagger poised, [he]_p4580 sprang upon the bulwarks to cast [himself]_p4581 into the sea. [He]_p4582 did not know that the crocodile was waiting for [him]_p4583 for [we]_p4585 purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from [us]_p4586 at the end. [He]_p4587 had one last triumph, which [I]_p4588 think [we]_p4589 need not grudge him. As [he]_p4590 stood on the bulwark looking over [his]_p4592 shoulder at [Peter]_n1837 gliding through the air, [he]_p4591 invited [him]_p4594 with a gesture to use [his]_p4593 foot. [It]_p4595 made [Peter]_n1838 kick instead of stab.",5,,33,
barrie_peter_pan," At last [Hook]_n1839 had got the boon for which [he]_p4596 craved. ""Bad form,"". [he]_p4597 cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile. Thus perished [James Hook]_n1840. ""Seventeen,"". [Slightly]_n1841 sang out but [he]_p4598 was not quite correct in [his]_p4599 figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for [their]_p4600 crimes that night but two reached the shore: [Starkey]_n1842 to be captured by the redskins, who made [him]_p4602 nurse for all [their]_p4601 papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate and [Smee]_n1843 , who henceforth wandered about the world in [his]_p4603 spectacles, making a precarious living by saying [he]_p4604 was the only man that [Jas]_n1844. [Hook]_n1845 had feared. [Wendy]_n1846 , of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watching [Peter]_n1847 with glistening eyes but now that all was over [she]_p4605 became prominent again. [She]_p4606 praised [them]_p4607 equally, and shuddered delightfully when [Michael]_n1848 showed [her]_p4609 the place where [he]_p4610 had killed one and then [she]_p4611 took [them]_p4608 into [Hook]_n1849 's cabin and pointed to [his]_p4612 watch which was hanging on a nail.",11,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [It]_p4613 said. ""half-past one!   The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. [She]_p4614 got [them]_p4615 to bed in the pirates' bunks pretty quickly, [you]_p4616 may be sure all but [Peter]_n1850 , who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last [he]_p4617 fell [asleep]_n1851 by the side of [Long Tom]_n1852. [He]_p4618 had one of [his]_p4619 dreams that night, and cried in [his]_p4620 sleep for a long time, and [Wendy]_n1853 held [him]_p4621 tightly. Chapter 16 THE [RETURN HOME]_n1854 By three bells that morning [they]_p4622 were all stirring [their]_p4623 stumps [legs] for there was a big sea running and [Tootles]_n1855 , the bo'sun, was among them, with a rope's end in [his]_p4624 hand and chewing tobacco. [They]_p4625 all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with the true nautical roll and hitching [their]_p4626 trousers. [It]_p4627 need not be said who was the captain. [Nibs]_n1856 and [John]_n1857 were first and second mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars [sailors] before the mast, and lived in the fo'c'sle.",8,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [Peter]_n1858 had already lashed [himself]_p4628 to the wheel but [he]_p4629 piped all hands and delivered a short address to [them]_p4633 said [he]_p4630 hoped [they]_p4635 would do [their]_p4638 duty like gallant hearties, but that [he]_p4630 knew [they]_p4636 were the scum of [Rio]_n1859 and the [Gold Coast]_n1860 , and if [they]_p4636 snapped at [him]_p4639 [he]_p4631 would tear them. The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and [they]_p4640 cheered [him]_p4641 lustily. Then a few sharp orders were given, and [they]_p4642 turned the ship round, and nosed [her]_p4643 for the mainland. [Captain Pan]_n1861 calculated, after consulting the ship's chart, that if this weather lasted [they]_p4644 should strike the Azores about the 21st of [June]_n1862 , after which [it]_p4645 would save time to fly. Some of [them]_p4646 wanted [it]_p4648 to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping [it]_p4649 a pirate but the captain treated [them]_p4647 as dogs, and [they]_p4650 dared not express [their]_p4652 wishes to [him]_p4653 even in a round robin [one person after another, as [they]_p4651 had to Cpt. [Hook]_n1863 ]. Instant obedience was the only safe thing. [Slightly]_n1864 got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings. The general feeling was that [Peter]_n1865 was honest just now to lull [Wendy]_n1866 's suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against [her]_p4654 will, [she]_p4655 was making for [him]_p4656 out of some of [Hook]_n1867 's wickedest garments. [It]_p4657 was afterwards whispered among [them]_p4658 that on the first night [he]_p4659 wore this suit [he]_p4660 sat long in the cabin with [Hook]_n1868 's cigar-holder in [his]_p4662 mouth and one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which [he]_p4660 bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.",11,,34,
barrie_peter_pan," Instead of watching the ship, however, [we]_p4663 must now return to that desolate home from which three of [our]_p4664 characters had taken heartless flight so long ago. [It]_p4665 seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time and yet [we]_p4666 may be sure that [Mrs Darling]_n1869 does not blame us. If [we]_p4667 had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, [she]_p4668 would probably have cried,. ""Don't be silly what do [I]_p4669 matter? Do go back and keep an eye on the children. "". So long as mothers are like this [their]_p4670 children will take advantage of [them]_p4671 and [they]_p4672 may lay to [bet on] that. Even now [we]_p4673 venture into that familiar nursery only because [its]_p4675 lawful occupants are on [their]_p4676 way home [we]_p4674 are merely hurrying on in advance of [them]_p4678 to see that [their]_p4677 beds are properly aired and that Mr and [Mrs Darling]_n1870 do not go out for the evening. [We]_p4679 are no more than servants. Why on earth should [their]_p4680 beds be properly aired, seeing that [they]_p4682 left [them]_p4685 in such a thankless hurry? Would [it]_p4688 not serve [them]_p4686 jolly well right if [they]_p4683 came back and found that [their]_p4681 parents were spending the week-end in the country? [It]_p4689 would be the moral lesson [they]_p4683 have been in need of ever since [we]_p4690 met [them]_p4686 but if [we]_p4691 contrived things in this way [Mrs Darling]_n1871 would never forgive us.",3,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," [One]_n1872 thing [I]_p4692 should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed [they]_p4693 will be here on [Thursday]_n1873 week. This would spoil so completely the surprise to which [Wendy]_n1874 and [John]_n1875 and [Michael]_n1876 are looking forward. [They]_p4694 have been planning [it]_p4695 out on the ship: mother's rapture, father's shout of joy, [Nana]_n1877 's leap through the air to embrace [them]_p4696 first, when what [they]_p4697 ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil [it]_p4698 all by breaking the news in advance so that when [they]_p4699 enter grandly [Mrs Darling]_n1878 may not even offer [Wendy]_n1879 [her]_p4700 mouth, and [Mr Darling]_n1880 may exclaim pettishly,. ""Dash [it]_p4701 all, here are those boys again. "". However, [we]_p4702 should get no thanks even for this. [We]_p4703 are beginning to know [Mrs Darling]_n1881 by this time, and may be sure that [she]_p4704 would upbraid [us]_p4705 for depriving the children of [their]_p4706 little pleasure. ""But, [my]_p4707 dear madam, [it]_p4708 is ten days till [Thursday]_n1882 week so that by telling [you]_p4709 what's what, [we]_p4711 can save [you]_p4710 ten days of unhappiness. ""Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of delight.",11,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Oh, if [you]_p4712 look at [it]_p4713 in that way!. ""What other way is there in which to look at it?   [You]_p4714 see, the woman had no proper spirit. [I]_p4715 had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about [her]_p4718 but [I]_p4716 despise her, and not one of [them]_p4720 will [I]_p4716 say now. [She]_p4721 does not really need to be told to have things ready, for [they]_p4722 are ready. All the beds are aired, and [she]_p4723 never leaves the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use [we]_p4724 are to her, [we]_p4725 might well go back to the ship. However, as [we]_p4726 are here [we]_p4727 may as well stay and look on. That is all [we]_p4728 are, lookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let [us]_p4729 watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that some of [them]_p4730 will hurt.",0,,18,
barrie_peter_pan," The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, [Mr Darling]_n1883 felt in [his]_p4731 bones that all the blame was [his]_p4732 for having chained [Nana]_n1884 up, and that from first to last [she]_p4733 had been wiser than he. Of course, as [we]_p4734 have seen, [he]_p4735 was quite a simple man indeed [he]_p4736 might have passed for a boy again if [he]_p4736 had been able to take [his]_p4740 baldness off  but [he]_p4737 had also a noble sense of justice and a lion's courage to do what seemed right to [him]_p4741 and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, [he]_p4737 went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel. To all [Mrs Darling]_n1885 's dear invitations to [him]_p4742 to come out [he]_p4743 replied sadly but firmly:. ""No, [my]_p4744 own one, this is the place for me. In the bitterness of [his]_p4745 remorse [he]_p4747 swore that [he]_p4748 would never leave the kennel until [his]_p4746 children came back. Of course this was a pity but whatever [Mr Darling]_n1886 did [he]_p4749 had to do in excess, otherwise [he]_p4750 soon gave up doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud [George Darling]_n1887 , as [he]_p4751 sat in the kennel of an evening talking with [his]_p4752 wife of [their]_p4753 children and all [their]_p4754 pretty ways. Very touching was [his]_p4755 deference to [Nana]_n1888. [He]_p4756 would not let [her]_p4757 come into the kennel, but on all other matters [he]_p4759 followed [her]_p4758 wishes implicitly.",6,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," Every morning the kennel was carried with [Mr Darling]_n1889 in [it]_p4760 to a cab, which conveyed [him]_p4761 to [his]_p4762 office, and [he]_p4763 returned home in the same way at six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if [we]_p4764 remember how sensitive [he]_p4765 was to the opinion of neighbours: this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly [he]_p4766 must have suffered torture but [he]_p4767 preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised [his]_p4769 little home, and [he]_p4767 always lifted [his]_p4770 hat courteously to any [lady]_n1890 who looked inside. [It]_p4771 may have been Quixotic, but [it]_p4772 was magnificent. Soon the inward meaning of [it]_p4773 leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched. Crowds followed the cab, cheering [it]_p4774 lustily charming girls scaled [it]_p4775 to get [his]_p4776 autograph interviews appeared in the better class of papers, and society invited [him]_p4777 to dinner and added,. ""Do come in the kennel. On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting [George]_n1891 's return home a very sad-eyed woman. Now that [we]_p4778 look at [her]_p4779 closely and remember the gaiety of [her]_p4780 in the old days, all gone now just because [she]_p4783 has lost [her]_p4780 babes, [I]_p4784 find [I]_p4785 won't be able to say nasty things about [her]_p4781 after all. If [she]_p4786 was too fond of [her]_p4788 rubbishy children, [she]_p4787 couldn't help it.",3,,29,
barrie_peter_pan," Look at [her]_p4789 in [her]_p4790 chair, where [she]_p4791 has fallen [asleep]_n1892. The corner of [her]_p4792 mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up. [Her]_p4793 hand moves restlessly on [her]_p4794 breast as if [she]_p4795 had a pain there. Some like [Peter]_n1893 best, and some like [Wendy]_n1894 best, but [I]_p4796 like [her]_p4797 best. Suppose, to make [her]_p4798 happy, [we]_p4801 whisper to [her]_p4799 in [her]_p4799 sleep that the brats are coming back. [They]_p4802 are really within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all [we]_p4803 need whisper is that [they]_p4804 are on the way. Let's. [It]_p4805 is a pity [we]_p4806 did it, for [she]_p4807 has started up, calling [their]_p4808 names and there is no one in the room but [Nana]_n1895. ""[O Nana]_n1896 , [I]_p4809 dreamt [my]_p4810 dear ones had come back. [Nana]_n1897 had filmy eyes, but all [she]_p4811 could do was put [her]_p4812 paw gently on [her]_p4813 mistress's lap and [they]_p4814 were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back.",6,,26,
barrie_peter_pan," As [Mr Darling]_n1898 puts [his]_p4815 head out to kiss [his]_p4816 wife, [we]_p4818 see that [his]_p4816 face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression. [He]_p4819 gave [his]_p4820 hat to [Liza]_n1899 , who took [it]_p4821 scornfully for [she]_p4822 had no imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering, and [he]_p4823 was naturally not unmoved. ""[Listen]_n1900 to them,"". [he]_p4824 said. ""it is very gratifying. ""Lots of little boys,"". sneered [Liza]_n1901. ""There were several adults [to-day]_n1902 ,"". [he]_p4825 assured [her]_p4827 with a faint flush  but when [she]_p4830 tossed [her]_p4828 head [he]_p4826 had not a word of reproof for her.",5,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," Social success had not spoilt [him]_p4831 [it]_p4833 had made [him]_p4832 sweeter. For some time [he]_p4834 sat with [his]_p4835 head out of the kennel, talking with [Mrs Darling]_n1903 of this success, and pressing [her]_p4837 hand reassuringly when [she]_p4838 said [she]_p4839 hoped [his]_p4836 head would not be turned by it. ""But if [I]_p4840 had been a weak man,"". [he]_p4841 said. ""Good heavens, if [I]_p4842 had been a weak man!. ""And, [George]_n1904 ,"". [she]_p4843 said timidly,. ""you are as full of remorse as ever, aren't you?. ""Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See [my]_p4844 punishment: living in a kennel. ""But [it]_p4845 is punishment, isn't it, [George]_n1905 ? [You]_p4848 are sure [you]_p4849 are not enjoying it?.",3,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," ""My love!   [You]_p4850 may be sure [she]_p4851 begged [his]_p4852 pardon and then, feeling drowsy, [he]_p4853 curled round in the kennel. ""Won't [you]_p4854 play [me]_p4855 to sleep,"". [he]_p4856 asked,. ""on the nursery piano?"". and as [she]_p4857 was crossing to the day-nursery [he]_p4858 added thoughtlessly,. ""And shut that window. [I]_p4859 feel a draught. ""[O George]_n1906 , never ask [me]_p4860 to do that. The window must always be left open for them, always, always. Now [it]_p4861 was [his]_p4862 turn to beg [her]_p4863 pardon and [she]_p4864 went into the day-nursery and played, and soon [he]_p4865 was [asleep]_n1907 and while [he]_p4866 slept, [Wendy]_n1908 and [John]_n1909 and [Michael]_n1910 flew into the room.",5,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," Oh no. [We]_p4867 have written [it]_p4868 so, because that was the charming arrangement planned by [them]_p4871 before [we]_p4872 left the ship but something must have happened since then, for [it]_p4869 is not [they]_p4873 who have flown in, [it]_p4869 is Peter and [Tinker Bell]_n1911. [Peter]_n1912 's first words tell all. ""[Quick Tink]_n1913 ,"". [he]_p4874 whispered,. ""close the window bar it! That's right. Now [you]_p4875 and [I]_p4876 must get away by the door and when [Wendy]_n1914 comes [she]_p4877 will think [her]_p4879 mother has barred [her]_p4880 out and [she]_p4878 will have to go back with me. Now [I]_p4881 understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when [Peter]_n1915 had exterminated the pirates [he]_p4882 did not return to the island and leave [Tink]_n1916 to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in [his]_p4883 head all the time. Instead of feeling that [he]_p4884 was behaving badly [he]_p4885 danced with glee then [he]_p4885 peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing.",6,,20,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p4887 whispered to [Tink]_n1917 ,. ""It's [Wendy]_n1918 's mother! [She]_p4888 is a pretty [lady]_n1919 , but not so pretty as [my]_p4889 mother. [Her]_p4890 mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as [my]_p4891 mother's was. Of course [he]_p4892 knew nothing whatever about [his]_p4894 mother but [he]_p4893 sometimes bragged about her. [He]_p4895 did not know the tune, which was. ""[Home]_n1920 , [Sweet]_n1921 [Home]_n1922 ,"". but [he]_p4896 knew [it]_p4897 was saying,. ""Come back, [Wendy]_n1923 , [Wendy][_n , ]_n Wendy"". and [he]_p4898 cried exultantly,. ""You will never see [Wendy]_n1924 again, [lady]_n1925 , for the window is barred! [He]_p4899 peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now [he]_p4900 saw that [Mrs Darling]_n1926 had laid [her]_p4901 head on the box, and that two tears were sitting on [her]_p4902 eyes.",11,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""She wants [me]_p4903 to unbar the window,"". thought [Peter]_n1927 ,. ""but [I]_p4904 won't, not I!   [He]_p4906 peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had taken [their]_p4907 place. ""She's awfully fond of [Wendy]_n1928 ,"". [he]_p4908 said to himself. [He]_p4909 was angry with [her]_p4910 now for not seeing why [she]_p4911 could not have [Wendy]_n1929. The reason was so simple:. ""I'm fond of [her]_p4912 too. [We]_p4913 can't both have her, [lady]_n1930. But the [lady]_n1931 would not make the best of it, and [he]_p4914 was unhappy.",5,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [He]_p4915 ceased to look at her, but even then [she]_p4916 would not let go of him. [He]_p4917 skipped about and made funny faces, but when [he]_p4918 stopped [it]_p4919 was just as if [she]_p4920 were inside him, knocking. ""Oh, all right,"". [he]_p4921 said at last, and gulped. Then [he]_p4922 unbarred the window. ""Come on, [Tink]_n1932 ,"". [he]_p4923 cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature. ""we don't want any silly mothers "". and [he]_p4924 flew away. Thus [Wendy]_n1933 and [John]_n1934 and [Michael]_n1935 found the window open for [them]_p4925 after all, which of course was more than [they]_p4926 deserved.",4,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," [They]_p4927 alighted on the floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already forgotten [his]_p4928 home. ""[John]_n1936 ,"". [he]_p4929 said, looking around [him]_p4930 doubtfully,. ""I think [I]_p4931 have been here before. ""Of course [you]_p4933 have, [you]_p4934 silly. There is [your]_p4935 old bed. ""So [it]_p4936 is,"". [Michael]_n1937 said, but not with much conviction. ""I say,"". cried [John]_n1938 ,.",3,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""the kennel!"". and [he]_p4937 dashed across to look into it. ""Perhaps [Nana]_n1939 is inside it,"". [Wendy]_n1940 said. But [John]_n1941 whistled. ""[Hullo]_n1942 ,"". [he]_p4938 said,. ""there's a man inside it. ""It's father!"". exclaimed [Wendy]_n1943.",5,,2,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Let [me]_p4939 see father,"". [Michael]_n1944 begged eagerly, and [he]_p4940 took a good look. ""He is not so big as the pirate [I]_p4941 killed,"". [he]_p4942 said with such frank disappointment that [I]_p4944 am glad [Mr Darling]_n1945 was [asleep]_n1946 [it]_p4945 would have been sad if those had been the first words [he]_p4943 heard [his]_p4946 little [Michael]_n1947 say. [Wendy]_n1948 and [John]_n1949 had been taken aback somewhat at finding [their]_p4947 father in the kennel. ""Surely,"". said [John]_n1950 , like one who had lost faith in [his]_p4948 memory,. ""he used not to sleep in the kennel?. ""[John]_n1951 ,"". [Wendy]_n1952 said falteringly,.",9,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""perhaps [we]_p4949 don't remember the old life as well as [we]_p4950 thought [we]_p4950 did. A chill fell upon [them]_p4952 and serve [them]_p4953 right. ""It is very careless of mother,"". said that young scoundrel [John]_n1953 ,. ""not to be here when [we]_p4954 come back. [It]_p4955 was then that [Mrs Darling]_n1954 began playing again. ""It's mother!"". cried [Wendy]_n1955 , peeping. ""So [it]_p4956 is!"". said [John]_n1956.",4,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Then are [you]_p4957 not really [our]_p4958 mother, [Wendy]_n1957 ?"". asked [Michael]_n1958 , who was surely sleepy. ""Oh dear!"". exclaimed [Wendy]_n1959 , with [her]_p4959 first real twinge of remorse [for having gone],. ""it was quite time [we]_p4960 came back. ""Let [us]_p4961 creep in,"". [John]_n1960 suggested,. ""and put [our]_p4962 hands over [her]_p4963 eyes. But [Wendy]_n1961 , who saw that [they]_p4964 must break the joyous news more gently, had a better plan. ""Let [us]_p4965 all slip into [our]_p4966 beds, and be there when [she]_p4967 comes in, just as if [we]_p4968 had never been away.",5,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," And so when [Mrs Darling]_n1962 went back to the night-nursery to see if [her]_p4969 husband was [asleep]_n1963 , all the beds were occupied. The children waited for [her]_p4970 cry of joy, but [it]_p4971 did not come. [She]_p4972 saw them, but [she]_p4973 did not believe [they]_p4974 were there. [You]_p4975 see, [she]_p4976 saw [them]_p4978 in [their]_p4979 beds so often in [her]_p4980 dreams that [she]_p4977 thought this was just the dream hanging around [her]_p4981 still. [She]_p4982 sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days [she]_p4983 had nursed them. [They]_p4984 could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them. ""[Mother]_n1964 !"". [Wendy]_n1965 cried. ""That's [Wendy]_n1966 ,"". [she]_p4985 said, but still [she]_p4986 was sure [it]_p4987 was the dream.",5,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Mother]_n1967 !. ""That's [John]_n1968 ,"". [she]_p4988 said. ""[Mother]_n1969 !"". cried [Michael]_n1970. [He]_p4989 knew [her]_p4990 now. ""That's [Michael]_n1971 ,"". [she]_p4991 said, and [she]_p4992 stretched out [her]_p4993 arms for the three little selfish children [they]_p4994 would never envelop again. Yes, [they]_p4995 did, [they]_p4996 went round [Wendy]_n1972 and [John]_n1973 and [Michael]_n1974 , who had slipped out of bed and run to her. ""[George]_n1975 , [George]_n1976 !"".",10,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p4997 cried when [she]_p4998 could speak and [Mr Darling]_n1977 woke to share [her]_p4999 bliss, and [Nana]_n1978 came rushing in. There could not have been a lovelier sight but there was none to see [it]_p5000 except a little boy who was staring in at the window. [He]_p5001 had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know but [he]_p5002 was looking through the window at the one joy from which [he]_p5003 must be for ever barred. Chapter 17 WHEN [WENDY GREW]_n1979 UP [I]_p5004 hope [you]_p5005 want to know what became of the other boys. [They]_p5006 were waiting below to give [Wendy]_n1980 time to explain about [them]_p5007 and when [they]_p5008 had counted five hundred [they]_p5009 went up. [They]_p5010 went up by the stair, because [they]_p5011 thought this would make a better impression. [They]_p5012 stood in a row in front of [Mrs Darling]_n1981 , with [their]_p5013 hats off, and wishing [they]_p5015 were not wearing [their]_p5014 pirate clothes. [They]_p5016 said nothing, but [their]_p5017 eyes asked [her]_p5018 to have them. [They]_p5019 ought to have looked at [Mr Darling]_n1982 also, but [they]_p5020 forgot about him. Of course [Mrs Darling]_n1983 said at once that [she]_p5021 would have [them]_p5022 but [Mr Darling]_n1984 was curiously depressed, and [they]_p5023 saw that [he]_p5024 considered six a rather large number.",8,,28,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I must say,"". [he]_p5025 said to [Wendy]_n1985 ,. ""that [you]_p5026 don't do things by halves,"". a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them. The first twin was the proud one, and [he]_p5027 asked, flushing,. ""Do [you]_p5028 think [we]_p5029 should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, [we]_p5030 can go away. ""[Father]_n1986 !"". [Wendy]_n1987 cried, shocked but still the cloud was on him. [He]_p5031 knew [he]_p5032 was behaving unworthily, but [he]_p5033 could not help it. ""We could lie doubled up,"".",3,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Nibs]_n1988. ""I always cut [their]_p5034 hair myself,"". said [Wendy]_n1989. ""[George]_n1990 !"". [Mrs Darling]_n1991 exclaimed, pained to see [her]_p5035 dear one showing [himself]_p5036 in such an unfavourable light. Then [he]_p5037 burst into tears, and the truth came out. [He]_p5038 was as glad to have [them]_p5039 as [she]_p5040 was, [he]_p5041 said, but [he]_p5042 thought [they]_p5043 should have asked [his]_p5044 consent as well as hers, instead of treating [him]_p5046 as a cypher [zero] in [his]_p5045 own house. ""I don't think [he]_p5047 is a cypher,"". [Tootles]_n1992 cried instantly. ""Do [you]_p5048 think [he]_p5049 is a cypher, [Curly]_n1993 ?.",6,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No, [I]_p5050 don't. Do [you]_p5051 think [he]_p5052 is a cypher, [Slightly]_n1994 ?. ""Rather not. [Twin]_n1995 , what do [you]_p5053 think? [It]_p5054 turned out that not one of [them]_p5055 thought [him]_p5057 a cypher and [he]_p5058 was absurdly gratified, and said [he]_p5059 would find space for [them]_p5056 all in the drawing-room if [they]_p5060 fitted in. ""We'll fit in, sir,"". [they]_p5061 assured him. ""Then follow the leader,"". [he]_p5062 cried gaily. ""Mind you, [I]_p5063 am not sure that [we]_p5064 have a drawing-room, but [we]_p5065 pretend [we]_p5065 have, and it's all the same. Hoop la!   [He]_p5067 went off dancing through the house, and [they]_p5068 all cried.",2,,19,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Hoop la!"". and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room and [I]_p5069 forget whether [they]_p5070 found it, but at any rate [they]_p5071 found corners, and [they]_p5071 all fitted in. As for [Peter]_n1996 , [he]_p5073 saw [Wendy]_n1997 once again before [he]_p5074 flew away. [He]_p5075 did not exactly come to the window, but [he]_p5076 brushed against [it]_p5077 in passing so that [she]_p5079 could open [it]_p5078 if [she]_p5080 liked and call to him. That is what [she]_p5081 did. ""[Hullo]_n1998 , [Wendy]_n1999 , good-bye,"". [he]_p5082 said. ""Oh dear, are [you]_p5083 going away?. ""Yes. ""You don't feel, [Peter]_n2000 ,"".",5,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p5084 said falteringly,. ""that [you]_p5085 would like to say anything to [my]_p5086 parents about a very sweet subject?. ""No. ""About me, [Peter]_n2001 ?. ""No. [Mrs Darling]_n2002 came to the window, for at present [she]_p5087 was keeping a sharp eye on [Wendy]_n2003. [She]_p5088 told [Peter]_n2004 that [she]_p5089 had adopted all the other boys, and would like to adopt [him]_p5090 also. ""Would [you]_p5091 send [me]_p5092 to school?"". [he]_p5093 inquired craftily. ""Yes.",4,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""And then to an office?. ""I suppose so. ""Soon [I]_p5094 would be a man?. ""Very soon. ""I don't want to go to school and learn solemn things,"". [he]_p5095 told [her]_p5096 passionately. ""I don't want to be a man. O [Wendy]_n2005 's mother, if [I]_p5097 was to wake up and feel there was a beard!. ""[Peter]_n2006 ,"". said [Wendy]_n2007 the comforter,.",3,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I should love [you]_p5098 in a beard "". and [Mrs Darling]_n2008 stretched out [her]_p5099 arms to him, but [he]_p5101 repulsed her. ""Keep back, [lady]_n2009 , no one is going to catch [me]_p5102 and make [me]_p5103 a man. ""But where are [you]_p5104 going to live?. ""With [Tink]_n2010 in the house [we]_p5105 built for [Wendy]_n2011. The fairies are to put [it]_p5106 high up among the tree tops where [they]_p5107 sleep at nights. ""How lovely,"". cried [Wendy]_n2012 so longingly that [Mrs Darling]_n2013 tightened [her]_p5108 grip. ""I thought all the fairies were dead,"". [Mrs Darling]_n2014 said.",7,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""There are always a lot of young ones,"". explained [Wendy]_n2015 , who was now quite an authority,. ""because [you]_p5109 see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies. [They]_p5110 live in nests on the tops of trees and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what [they]_p5111 are. ""I shall have such fun,"". said [Peter]_n2016 , with eye on [Wendy]_n2017. ""It will be rather lonely in the evening,"". [she]_p5112 said,. ""sitting by the fire. ""I shall have [Tink]_n2018.",4,,4,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Tink]_n2019 can't go a twentieth part of the way round,"". [she]_p5113 reminded [him]_p5114 a little tartly. ""Sneaky tell-tale!"". [Tink]_n2020 called out from somewhere round the corner. ""It doesn't matter,"". [Peter]_n2021 said. ""[O Peter]_n2022 , [you]_p5115 know [it]_p5116 matters.

[Peter]_n2024 said, as if [he]_p5124 had asked [her]_p5125 from politeness merely but [Mrs Darling]_n2025 saw [his]_p5126 mouth twitch, and [she]_p5128 made this handsome offer: to let [Wendy]_n2026 go to [him]_p5129 for a week every year to do [his]_p5127 spring cleaning. [Wendy]_n2027 would have preferred a more permanent arrangement and [it]_p5130 seemed to [her]_p5131 that spring would be long in coming but this promise sent [Peter]_n2028 away quite gay again. [He]_p5132 had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all [I]_p5133 have told [you]_p5134 about [him]_p5135 is only a halfpenny-worth of them. [I]_p5136 suppose [it]_p5137 was because [Wendy]_n2029 knew this that [her]_p5138 last words to [him]_p5139 were these rather plaintive ones:. ""You won't forget me, [Peter]_n2030 , will you, before spring cleaning time comes? Of course [Peter]_n2031 promised and then [he]_p5140 flew away. [He]_p5141 took [Mrs Darling]_n2032 's kiss with him.",9,,23,
barrie_peter_pan," The kiss that had been for no one else, [Peter]_n2033 took quite easily. [Funny]_n2034. But [she]_p5142 seemed satisfied. Of course all the boys went to school and most of [them]_p5143 got into [Class III]_n2035 , but [Slightly]_n2036 was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. [Class]_n2037 [I]_p5144 is the top class. Before [they]_p5145 had attended school a week [they]_p5146 saw what goats [they]_p5146 had been not to remain on the island but [it]_p5149 was too late now, and soon [they]_p5147 settled down to being as ordinary as [you]_p5150 or [me]_p5151 or [Jenkins]_n2038 minor [the younger [Jenkins]_n2039 ]. [It]_p5152 is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them. At first [Nana]_n2040 tied [their]_p5153 feet to the bed-posts so that [they]_p5156 should not fly away in the night and one of [their]_p5154 diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses [the [English]_n2041 double-deckers] but by and by [they]_p5157 ceased to tug at [their]_p5154 bonds in bed, and found that [they]_p5157 hurt [themselves]_p5160 when [they]_p5158 let go of the bus. In time [they]_p5161 could not even fly after [their]_p5162 hats. Want of practice, [they]_p5163 called [it]_p5165 but what [it]_p5166 really meant was that [they]_p5164 no longer believed.",9,,25,
barrie_peter_pan," [Michael]_n2042 believed longer than the other boys, though [they]_p5167 jeered at [him]_p5168 so [he]_p5169 was with [Wendy]_n2043 when [Peter]_n2044 came for [her]_p5170 at the end of the first year. [She]_p5171 flew away with Peter in the frock [she]_p5172 had woven from leaves and berries in the [Neverland]_n2045 , and [her]_p5173 one fear was that [he]_p5174 might notice how short [it]_p5177 had become but [he]_p5175 never noticed, [he]_p5175 had so much to say about himself. [She]_p5178 had looked forward to thrilling talks with [him]_p5179 about old times, but new adventures had crowded the old ones from [his]_p5180 mind. ""Who is [Captain Hook]_n2046 ?"". [he]_p5181 asked with interest when [she]_p5182 spoke of the arch enemy. ""Don't [you]_p5183 remember,"". [she]_p5184 asked, amazed,. ""how [you]_p5185 killed [him]_p5186 and saved all [our]_p5187 lives?. ""I forget [them]_p5190 after [I]_p5188 kill them,"". [he]_p5192 replied carelessly.",5,,24,
barrie_peter_pan," When [she]_p5193 expressed a doubtful hope that [Tinker Bell]_n2047 would be glad to see [her]_p5194 [he]_p5195 said,. ""Who is [Tinker Bell]_n2048 ?. ""[O Peter]_n2049 ,"". [she]_p5196 said, shocked but even when [she]_p5197 explained [he]_p5198 could not remember. ""There are such a lot of them,"". [he]_p5199 said. ""I expect [she]_p5200 is no more. [I]_p5201 expect [he]_p5202 was right, for fairies don't live long, but [they]_p5203 are so little that a short time seems a good while to them. [Wendy]_n2050 was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to [Peter]_n2051 [it]_p5204 had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But [he]_p5205 was exactly as fascinating as ever, and [they]_p5206 had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.",5,,14,
barrie_peter_pan," [Next]_n2052 year [he]_p5207 did not come for her. [She]_p5208 waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but [he]_p5209 never came. ""Perhaps [he]_p5210 is ill,"". [Michael]_n2053 said. ""You know [he]_p5211 is never ill. [Michael]_n2054 came close to [her]_p5212 and whispered, with a shiver,. ""Perhaps there is no such person, [Wendy]_n2055 !"". and then [Wendy]_n2056 would have cried if [Michael]_n2057 had not been crying. [Peter]_n2058 came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that [he]_p5213 never knew [he]_p5214 had missed a year. That was the last time the girl [Wendy]_n2059 ever saw him.",8,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," For a little longer [she]_p5215 tried for [his]_p5219 sake not to have growing pains and [she]_p5216 felt [she]_p5216 was untrue to [him]_p5220 when [she]_p5217 got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and when [they]_p5221 met again [Wendy]_n2060 was a married woman, and [Peter]_n2061 was no more to [her]_p5222 than a little dust in the box in which [she]_p5224 had kept [her]_p5223 toys. [Wendy]_n2062 was grown up. [You]_p5225 need not be sorry for her. [She]_p5226 was one of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end [she]_p5227 grew up of [her]_p5228 own free will a day quicker than other girls. All the boys were grown up and done for by this time so [it]_p5229 is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them. [You]_p5230 may see the twins and [Nibs]_n2063 and [Curly]_n2064 any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella. [Michael]_n2065 is an engine-driver [train engineer]. [Slightly]_n2066 married a [lady]_n2067 of title, and so [he]_p5231 became a lord.",8,,17,
barrie_peter_pan," [You]_p5232 see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be [Tootles]_n2068. The bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell [his]_p5233 children was once [John]_n2069. [Wendy]_n2070 was married in white with a pink sash. [It]_p5234 is strange to think that [Peter]_n2071 did not alight in the church and forbid the banns [formal announcement of a marriage]. Years rolled on again, and [Wendy]_n2072 had a daughter. This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash. [She]_p5235 was called [Jane]_n2073 , and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from the moment [she]_p5236 arrived on the mainland [she]_p5237 wanted to ask questions. When [she]_p5238 was old enough to ask [them]_p5239 [they]_p5240 were mostly about [Peter Pan]_n2074. [She]_p5241 loved to hear of [Peter]_n2075 , and [Wendy]_n2076 told [her]_p5242 all [she]_p5243 could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. [It]_p5244 was [Jane]_n2077 's nursery now, for [her]_p5245 father had bought [it]_p5246 at the three per cents [mortgage rate] from [Wendy]_n2078 's father, who was no longer fond of stairs.",11,,15,
barrie_peter_pan," [Mrs Darling]_n2079 was now dead and forgotten. There were only two beds in the nursery now, [Jane]_n2080 's and [her]_p5247 nurse's and there was no kennel, for [Nana]_n2081 also had passed away. [She]_p5248 died of old age, and at the end [she]_p5249 had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself. Once a week [Jane]_n2082 's nurse had [her]_p5250 evening off and then [it]_p5251 was [Wendy]_n2083 's part to put [Jane]_n2084 to bed. That was the time for stories. [It]_p5252 was [Jane]_n2085 's invention to raise the sheet over [her]_p5253 mother's head and [her]_p5254 own, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:. ""What do [we]_p5255 see now?. ""I don't think [I]_p5256 see anything [to-night]_n2086 ,"". says [Wendy]_n2087 , with a feeling that if [Nana]_n2088 were here [she]_p5258 would object to further conversation. ""Yes, [you]_p5259 do,"".",10,,12,
barrie_peter_pan," says [Jane]_n2089 ,. ""you see when [you]_p5260 were a little girl. ""That is a long time ago, sweetheart,"". says [Wendy]_n2090. ""Ah me, how time flies!. ""Does [it]_p5262 fly,"". asks the artful child,. ""the way [you]_p5263 flew when [you]_p5264 were a little girl?. ""The way [I]_p5265 flew? Do [you]_p5268 know, [Jane]_n2091 , [I]_p5266 sometimes wonder whether [I]_p5266 ever did really fly. ""Yes, [you]_p5269 did.",3,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""The dear old days when [I]_p5270 could fly!. ""Why can't [you]_p5271 fly now, mother?. ""Because [I]_p5272 am grown up, dearest. When people grow up [they]_p5273 forget the way. ""Why do [they]_p5274 forget the way?. ""Because [they]_p5275 are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. [It]_p5276 is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly. ""What is gay and innocent and heartless? [I]_p5277 do wish [I]_p5278 were gay and innocent and heartless. Or perhaps [Wendy]_n2092 admits [she]_p5279 does see something. ""I do believe,"".",1,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," [she]_p5280 says,. ""that [it]_p5281 is this nursery. ""I do believe [it]_p5282 is,"". says [Jane]_n2093. ""Go on. [They]_p5283 are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when [Peter]_n2094 flew in looking for [his]_p5284 shadow. ""The foolish fellow,"". says [Wendy]_n2095 ,. ""tried to stick [it]_p5285 on with soap, and when [he]_p5287 could not [he]_p5288 cried, and that woke me, and [I]_p5289 sewed [it]_p5286 on for him. ""You have missed a bit,"".",3,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," interrupts [Jane]_n2096 , who now knows the story better than [her]_p5290 mother. ""When [you]_p5291 saw [him]_p5293 sitting on the floor crying, what did [you]_p5292 say?. ""I sat up in bed and [I]_p5294 said, [Boy]_n2097 , why are [you]_p5296 crying?'. ""Yes, that was it,"". says [Jane]_n2098 , with a big breath. ""And then [he]_p5297 flew [us]_p5298 all away to the [Neverland]_n2099 and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaids' lagoon, and the home under the ground, and the little house. ""Yes! which did [you]_p5299 like best of all?. ""I think [I]_p5300 liked the home under the ground best of all. ""Yes, so do I. What was the last thing [Peter]_n2100 ever said to you?.",5,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""The last thing [he]_p5302 ever said to [me]_p5303 was, Just always be waiting for me, and then some night [you]_p5306 will hear [me]_p5304 crowing. '. ""Yes. ""But, alas, [he]_p5307 forgot all about me,"". [Wendy]_n2101 said [it]_p5308 with a smile. [She]_p5309 was as grown up as that. ""What did [his]_p5310 crow sound like?"". [Jane]_n2102 asked one evening. ""It was like this,"". [Wendy]_n2103 said, trying to imitate [Peter]_n2104 's crow.",4,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No, [it]_p5311 wasn't,"". [Jane]_n2105 said gravely,. ""it was like this "". and [she]_p5312 did [it]_p5313 ever so much better than [her]_p5314 mother. [Wendy]_n2106 was a little startled. ""My darling, how can [you]_p5315 know?. ""I often hear [it]_p5318 when [I]_p5316 am sleeping,"". [Jane]_n2107 said. ""Ah yes, many girls hear [it]_p5319 when [they]_p5321 are sleeping, but [I]_p5322 was the only one who heard [it]_p5320 awake. ""Lucky you,"".",3,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," said [Jane]_n2108. And then one night came the tragedy. [It]_p5323 was the spring of the year, and the story had been told for the night, and [Jane]_n2109 was now [asleep]_n2110 in [her]_p5324 bed. [Wendy]_n2111 was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery and while [she]_p5325 sat darning [she]_p5326 heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and [Peter]_n2112 dropped in on the floor. [He]_p5327 was exactly the same as ever, and [Wendy]_n2113 saw at once that [he]_p5328 still had all [his]_p5329 first teeth. [He]_p5330 was a little boy, and [she]_p5331 was grown up. [She]_p5332 huddled by the fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman. ""[Hullo]_n2114 , [Wendy]_n2115 ,"". [he]_p5333 said, not noticing any difference, for [he]_p5334 was thinking chiefly of [himself]_p5336 and in the dim light [her]_p5337 white dress might have been the nightgown in which [he]_p5334 had seen [her]_p5338 first.",8,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Hullo]_n2116 , [Peter]_n2117 ,"". [she]_p5339 replied faintly, squeezing [herself]_p5340 as small as possible. Something inside [her]_p5341 was crying. ""[Woman]_n2118 , [Woman]_n2119 , let go of me. ""[Hullo]_n2120 , where is [John]_n2121 ?"". [he]_p5342 asked, suddenly missing the third bed. ""[John]_n2122 is not here now,"". [she]_p5343 gasped. ""Is [Michael]_n2123 [asleep]_n2124 ?"". [he]_p5344 asked, with a careless glance at [Jane]_n2125.",10,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""Yes,"". [she]_p5345 answered and now [she]_p5346 felt that [she]_p5346 was untrue to [Jane]_n2126 as well as to [Peter]_n2127. ""That is not [Michael]_n2128 ,"". [she]_p5348 said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on her. [Peter]_n2129 looked. ""[Hullo]_n2130 , is [it]_p5349 a new one?. ""Yes. ""[Boy]_n2131 or girl?. ""Girl. Now surely [he]_p5350 would understand but not a bit of it.",6,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," ""[Peter]_n2132 ,"". [she]_p5351 said, faltering,. ""are [you]_p5352 expecting [me]_p5354 to fly away with you?. ""Of course that is why [I]_p5355 have come. "". [He]_p5356 added a little sternly,. ""Have [you]_p5357 forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?   [She]_p5358 knew [it]_p5359 was useless to say that [he]_p5360 had let many spring cleaning times pass. ""I can't come,"". [she]_p5361 said apologetically,. ""I have forgotten how to fly.",1,,10,
barrie_peter_pan," ""I'll soon teach [you]_p5362 again. ""[O Peter]_n2133 , don't waste the fairy dust on me. [She]_p5363 had risen and now at last a fear assailed him. ""What is it?"". [he]_p5364 cried, shrinking. ""I will turn up the light,"". [she]_p5365 said,. ""and then [you]_p5366 can see for yourself. For almost the only time in [his]_p5367 life that [I]_p5368 know of, [Peter]_n2134 was afraid. ""Don't turn up the light,"".",2,,7,
barrie_peter_pan," [he]_p5369 cried. [She]_p5370 let [her]_p5371 hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. [She]_p5372 was not a little girl heart-broken about [him]_p5373 [she]_p5374 was a grown woman smiling at [it]_p5375 all, but [they]_p5376 were wet-eyed smiles. Then [she]_p5377 turned up the light, and [Peter]_n2135 saw. [He]_p5378 gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift [him]_p5379 in [her]_p5380 arms [he]_p5381 drew back sharply. ""What is it?"". [he]_p5382 cried again. [She]_p5383 had to tell him. ""I am old, [Peter]_n2136. [I]_p5384 am ever so much more than twenty.",2,,16,
barrie_peter_pan," [I]_p5385 grew up long ago. ""You promised not to!. ""I couldn't help it. [I]_p5386 am a married woman, [Peter]_n2137. ""No, you're not. ""Yes, and the little girl in the bed is [my]_p5387 baby. ""No, she's not. But [he]_p5388 supposed [she]_p5390 was and [he]_p5389 took a step towards the sleeping child with [his]_p5391 dagger upraised. Of course [he]_p5392 did not strike. [He]_p5393 sat down on the floor instead and sobbed and [Wendy]_n2138 did not know how to comfort him, though [she]_p5394 could have done [it]_p5395 so easily once.",2,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," [She]_p5396 was only a woman now, and [she]_p5397 ran out of the room to try to think. [Peter]_n2139 continued to cry, and soon [his]_p5398 sobs woke [Jane]_n2140. [She]_p5399 sat up in bed, and was interested at once. ""[Boy]_n2141 ,"". [she]_p5400 said,. ""why are [you]_p5401 crying? [Peter]_n2142 rose and bowed to her, and [she]_p5402 bowed to [him]_p5403 from the bed. ""[Hullo]_n2143 ,"". [he]_p5404 said. ""[Hullo]_n2144 ,"". said [Jane]_n2145.",7,,9,
barrie_peter_pan," ""My name is [Peter Pan]_n2146 ,"". [he]_p5405 told her. ""Yes, [I]_p5406 know. ""I came back for [my]_p5407 mother,"". [he]_p5408 explained,. ""to take [her]_p5409 to the [Neverland]_n2147. ""Yes, [I]_p5410 know,"". [Jane]_n2148 said,. ""I have been waiting for you. When [Wendy]_n2149 returned diffidently [she]_p5411 found [Peter]_n2150 sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously, while [Jane]_n2151 in [her]_p5412 nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy.",6,,8,
barrie_peter_pan," ""She is [my]_p5413 mother,"". [Peter]_n2152 explained and [Jane]_n2153 descended and stood by [his]_p5414 side, with the look in [her]_p5415 face that [he]_p5416 liked to see on ladies when [they]_p5417 gazed at him. ""He does so need a mother,"". [Jane]_n2154 said. ""Yes, [I]_p5418 know,"". [Wendy]_n2155 admitted rather forlornly. ""no one knows [it]_p5419 so well as I. ""Good-bye,"". said [Peter]_n2156 to [Wendy]_n2157 and [he]_p5420 rose in the air, and the shameless [Jane]_n2158 rose with [him]_p5421 [it]_p5422 was already [her]_p5423 easiest way of moving about. [Wendy]_n2159 rushed to the window.",8,,11,
barrie_peter_pan," ""No, no,"". [she]_p5424 cried. ""It is just for spring cleaning time,"". [Jane]_n2160 said,. ""he wants [me]_p5425 always to do [his]_p5426 spring cleaning. ""If only [I]_p5427 could go with you,"". [Wendy]_n2161 sighed. ""You see [you]_p5428 can't fly,"". said [Jane]_n2162. Of course in the end [Wendy]_n2163 let [them]_p5429 fly away together.",4,,6,
barrie_peter_pan," [Our]_p5430 last glimpse of [her]_p5431 shows [her]_p5432 at the window, watching [them]_p5433 receding into the sky until [they]_p5434 were as small as stars. As [you]_p5435 look at [Wendy]_n2164 , [you]_p5436 may see [her]_p5437 hair becoming white, and [her]_p5438 figure little again, for all this happened long ago. [Jane]_n2165 is now a common grown-up, with a daughter called [Margaret]_n2166 and every spring cleaning time, except when [he]_p5439 forgets, Peter comes for [Margaret]_n2167 and takes [her]_p5441 to the [Neverland]_n2168 , where [she]_p5442 tells [him]_p5443 stories about himself, to which [he]_p5440 listens eagerly. When [Margaret]_n2169 grows up [she]_p5444 will have a daughter, who is to be [Peter]_n2170 's mother in turn and thus [it]_p5445 will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.",7,,16,
