stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde,"STORY OF THE DOOR [Mr Utterson]_n0 the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse backward in sentiment lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to [his]_p0 taste, something eminently human beaconed from [his]_p1 eye something indeed which never found [its]_p4 way into [his]_p1 talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of [his]_p2 life. [He]_p5 was austere with [himself]_p6 drank gin when [he]_p7 was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages and though [he]_p8 enjoyed the [theatre]_n1 , had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But [he]_p9 had an approved tolerance for others sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in [their]_p10 misdeeds and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. ""[I]_p11 incline to [Cain]_n2 's heresy, [he]_p12 used to say quaintly:. ""[I]_p13 let [my]_p14 brother go to the devil in [his]_p15 own way. "". In this character, [it]_p16 was frequently [his]_p17 fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as [they]_p18 came about [his]_p19 chambers, [he]_p21 never marked a shade of change in [his]_p20 demeanour. No doubt the feat was easy to [Mr Utterson]_n3 for [he]_p22 was undemonstrative at the best, and even [his]_p23 friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature.",4,,24,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p24 is the mark of a modest man to accept [his]_p25 friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity and that was the lawyer's way. [His]_p26 friends were those of [his]_p27 own blood or those whom [he]_p29 had known the longest [his]_p28 affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, [they]_p30 implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united [him]_p31 to [Mr Richard Enfield]_n4 , [his]_p32 distant kinsman, the well-known man about town. [It]_p33 was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject [they]_p34 could find in common. [It]_p35 was reported by those who encountered [them]_p36 in [their]_p37 [Sunday]_n5 walks, that [they]_p38 said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted [them]_p39 the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that [they]_p41 might enjoy [them]_p40 uninterrupted. [It]_p42 chanced on one of these rambles that [their]_p43 way led [them]_p44 down a by-street in a busy quarter of [London]_n6. The street was small and what is called quiet, but [it]_p45 drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, [it]_p46 seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of [their]_p47 grains in coquetry  so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on [Sunday]_n7 , when [it]_p48 veiled [its]_p49 more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to [its]_p50 dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest and with [its]_p50 freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.",4,,28,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward [its]_p52 gable on the street. [It]_p53 was two storeys high showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels children kept shop upon the steps the schoolboy had tried [his]_p54 knife on the mouldings and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair [their]_p55 ravages. [Mr Enfield]_n8 and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street but when [they]_p56 came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up [his]_p57 cane and pointed. ""Did [you]_p58 ever remark that door?"". [he]_p59 asked and when [his]_p60 companion had replied in the affirmative. ""[It]_p61 is connected in [my]_p62 mind,"". added he,. ""with a very odd story.",1,,11,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Indeed?"". said [Mr Utterson]_n9 , with a slight change of voice,. ""and what was that?. ""Well, [it]_p63 was this way,"". returned [Mr Enfield]_n10 :. ""[I]_p64 was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o'clock of a black winter morning, and [my]_p65 way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the folks asleep, street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church, till at last [I]_p66 got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, [I]_p67 saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as [she]_p68 was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner and then came the horrible part of the thing for the man trampled calmly over the child's body and left [her]_p69 screaming on the ground. [It]_p70 sounds nothing to hear, but [it]_p71 was hellish to see.",2,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p72 wasn't like a man [it]_p73 was like some damned [Juggernaut]_n11. [I]_p74 gave a few halloa, took to [my]_p75 heels, collared [my]_p76 gentleman, and brought [him]_p77 back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. [He]_p78 was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave [me]_p79 one look, so ugly that [it]_p81 brought out the sweat on [me]_p80 like running. The people who had turned out were the girl's own family and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom [she]_p82 had been sent put in [his]_p83 appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones and there [you]_p84 might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. [I]_p85 had taken a loathing to [my]_p86 gentleman at first sight. So had the child's family, which was only natural. But the doctor's case was what struck me. [He]_p87 was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong [Edinburgh]_n12 accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe.",2,,16,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Well, sir, [he]_p88 was like the rest of [us]_p90 every time [he]_p89 looked at [my]_p91 prisoner, [I]_p92 saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with desire to kill him. [I]_p93 knew what was in [his]_p94 mind, just as [he]_p95 knew what was in mine and killing being out of the question, [we]_p96 did the next best. [We]_p97 told the man [we]_p98 could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make [his]_p99 name stink from one end of [London]_n13 to the other. If [he]_p100 had any friends or any credit, [we]_p102 undertook that [he]_p101 should lose them. And all the time, as [we]_p103 were pitching [it]_p106 in red hot, [we]_p104 were keeping the women off [him]_p107 as best [we]_p104 could for [they]_p108 were as wild as harpies. [I]_p109 never saw a circle of such hateful faces and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering coolness, frightened too, [I]_p110 could see that, but carrying [it]_p111 off, sir, really like [Satan]_n14. `If [you]_p112 choose to make capital out of this accident,' said he, `I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,' says he. `Name [your]_p113 figure. ' Well, [we]_p114 screwed [him]_p115 up to a hundred pounds for the child's family [he]_p116 would have clearly liked to stick out but there was something about the lot of [us]_p118 that meant mischief, and at last [he]_p117 struck.",2,,31,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," The next thing was to get the money and where do [you]_p119 think [he]_p120 carried [us]_p121 but to that place with the door?, whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts's, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that [I]_p122 can't mention, though it's one of the points of [my]_p125 story, but [it]_p123 was a name at least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff but the signature was good for more than that if [it]_p126 was only genuine. [I]_p127 took the liberty of pointing out to [my]_p128 gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man's cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But [he]_p129 was quite easy and sneering. `Set [your]_p130 mind at rest,' says he, `I will stay with [you]_p131 till the banks open and cash the cheque myself. ' So [we]_p132 all set off, the doctor, and the child's father, and [our]_p134 friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in [my]_p135 chambers and next day, when [we]_p133 had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. [I]_p136 gave in the cheque myself, and said [I]_p137 had every reason to believe [it]_p138 was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine. ""[Tut-tut]_n15 ,"".",1,,19,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said [Mr Utterson]_n16. ""[I]_p139 see [you]_p141 feel as [I]_p140 do,"". said [Mr Enfield]_n17. ""Yes, it's a bad story. For [my]_p142 man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable man and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes [it]_p143 worse) one of [your]_p144 fellows who do what [they]_p145 call good. Black mail [I]_p146 suppose an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of [his]_p147 youth. [Black Mail House]_n18 is what [I]_p148 call the place with the door, in consequence. Though even that, [you]_p149 know, is far from explaining all,"". [he]_p150 added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing. From this [he]_p151 was recalled by [Mr Utterson]_n19 asking rather suddenly:.",4,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""And [you]_p152 don't know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?. ""A likely place, isn't it?"". returned [Mr Enfield]_n20. ""But [I]_p153 happen to have noticed [his]_p154 address [he]_p155 lives in some square or other. ""And [you]_p156 never asked about the, place with the door?"". said [Mr Utterson]_n21. ""No, sir: [I]_p157 had a delicacy,"". was the reply. ""[I]_p158 feel very strongly about putting questions [it]_p159 partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. [You]_p160 start a question, and it's like starting a stone.",2,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [You]_p161 sit quietly on the top of a hill and away the stone goes, starting others  and presently some bland old bird (the last [you]_p162 would have thought of) is knocked on the head in [his]_p163 own back garden and the family have to change [their]_p164 name. No sir, [I]_p165 make [it]_p167 a rule of mine: the more [it]_p168 looks like [Queer Street]_n22 , the less [I]_p166 ask. ""A very good rule, too,"". said the lawyer. ""But [I]_p169 have studied the place for myself,"". continued [Mr Enfield]_n23. ""[It]_p170 seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of [my]_p171 adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor none below the windows are always shut but they're clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking so somebody must live there.",2,,11,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," And yet it's not so sure for the buildings are so packed together about the court, that it's hard to say where one ends and another begins. The pair walked on again for a while in silence and then. ""[Enfield]_n24 , said [Mr Utterson]_n25 ,. ""that's a good rule of yours. ""Yes, [I]_p172 think [it]_p173 is,"". returned [Enfield]_n26. ""But for all that,"". continued the lawyer,. ""there's one point [I]_p174 want to ask: [I]_p175 want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child. ""Well,"".",3,,4,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said [Mr Enfield]_n27 ,. ""[I]_p176 can't see what harm [it]_p177 would do. [It]_p178 was a man of the name of [Hyde]_n28. ""Hm,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n29. ""What sort of a man is [he]_p179 to see?. ""[He]_p180 is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with [his]_p181 appearance something displeasing, something down-right detestable. [I]_p182 never saw a man [I]_p183 so disliked, and yet [I]_p183 scarce know why. [He]_p185 must be deformed somewhere [he]_p186 gives a strong feeling of deformity, although [I]_p187 couldn't specify the point.",3,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," He's an extraordinary looking man, and yet [I]_p188 really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir [I]_p189 can make no hand of [it]_p191 [I]_p190 can't describe him. And it's not want of memory for [I]_p192 declare [I]_p193 can see [him]_p194 this moment. [Mr Utterson]_n30 again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration. ""[You]_p195 are sure [he]_p196 used a key?"". [he]_p197 inquired at last. ""[My]_p198 dear sir. "". began [Enfield]_n31 , surprised out of himself. ""Yes, [I]_p199 know,"".",2,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said [Utterson]_n32. ""[I]_p200 know [it]_p201 must seem strange. The fact is, if [I]_p202 do not ask [you]_p204 the name of the other party, [it]_p205 is because [I]_p203 know [it]_p206 already. [You]_p207 see, [Richard]_n33 , [your]_p208 tale has gone home. If [you]_p209 have been inexact in any point [you]_p210 had better correct it. ""[I]_p211 think [you]_p212 might have warned me,"". returned the other with a touch of sullenness. ""But [I]_p213 have been pedantically exact, as [you]_p214 call it. The fellow had a key and what's more, [he]_p215 has [it]_p216 still. [I]_p217 saw [him]_p218 use [it]_p219 not a week ago.",2,,20,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [Mr Utterson]_n34 sighed deeply but said never a word and the young man presently resumed. ""Here is another lesson to say nothing,"". said he. ""[I]_p220 am ashamed of [my]_p221 long tongue. Let [us]_p222 make a bargain never to refer to this again. ""With all [my]_p223 heart,"". said the lawyer. ""[I]_p224 shake hands on that, [Richard]_n35. [SEARCH]_n36 FOR [MR]_n37. HYDE That evening [Mr Utterson]_n38 came home to [his]_p225 bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish.",5,,6,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p226 was [his]_p227 custom of a [Sunday]_n39 , when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on [his]_p228 reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when [he]_p229 would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, [he]_p230 took up a candle and went into [his]_p231 business room. There [he]_p232 opened [his]_p233 safe, took from the most private part of [it]_p234 a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr Jekyll's Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study [its]_p235 contents. The will was holograph, for [Mr Utterson]_n40 though [he]_p236 took charge of [it]_p237 now that [it]_p238 was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of [it]_p238 [it]_p239 provided not only that, in case of the decease of [Henry Jekyll]_n41 , M. D. , D. C. L. , L. L.",3,,15,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," D. , F. R. S. , etc. , all [his]_p241 possessions were to pass into the hands of [his]_p242. ""friend and benefactor [Edward Hyde]_n42 ,"". but that in case of Dr Jekyll's. ""disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,"". the said [Edward Hyde]_n43 should step into the said [Henry Jekyll]_n44 's shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor's household.",3,,2,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," This document had long been the lawyer's eyesore. [It]_p243 offended [him]_p244 both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto [it]_p245 was [his]_p247 ignorance of [Mr Hyde]_n45 that had swelled [his]_p248 indignation now, by a sudden turn, [it]_p246 was [his]_p248 knowledge. [It]_p250 was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which [he]_p251 could learn no more. [It]_p252 was worse when [it]_p253 began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled [his]_p254 eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend. ""[I]_p255 thought [it]_p256 was madness,"". [he]_p257 said, as [he]_p258 replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe,. ""and now [I]_p259 begin to fear [it]_p260 is disgrace. With that [he]_p261 blew out [his]_p262 candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in the direction of [Cavendish Square]_n46 , that citadel of medicine, where [his]_p263 friend, the great [Dr Lanyon]_n47 , had [his]_p263 house and received [his]_p264 crowding patients. ""If anyone knows, [it]_p266 will be [Lanyon]_n48 ,"".",4,,24,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p267 had thought. The solemn butler knew and welcomed [him]_p268 [he]_p269 was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where [Dr Lanyon]_n49 sat alone over [his]_p270 wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner. At sight of [Mr Utterson]_n50 , [he]_p271 sprang up from [his]_p272 chair and welcomed [him]_p273 with both hands. The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye but [it]_p274 reposed on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both thorough respectors of [themselves]_p275 and of each other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each other's company. After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied [his]_p276 mind. ""[I]_p277 suppose, [Lanyon]_n51 ,"". said he,. ""[you]_p278 and [I]_p279 must be the two oldest friends that [Henry Jekyll]_n52 has?.",4,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[I]_p280 wish the friends were younger,"". chuckled [Dr Lanyon]_n53. ""But [I]_p281 suppose [we]_p282 are. And what of that? [I]_p283 see little of [him]_p284 now. ""Indeed?"". said [Utterson]_n54. ""[I]_p285 thought [you]_p286 had a bond of common interest. ""[We]_p287 had,"". was the reply. ""But [it]_p288 is more than ten years since [Henry Jekyll]_n55 became too fanciful for me.",3,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [He]_p289 began to go wrong, wrong in mind  and though of course [I]_p290 continue to take an interest in [him]_p293 for old sake's sake, as [they]_p294 say, [I]_p291 see and [I]_p291 have seen devilish little of the man. Such unscientific balderdash,"". added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple,. ""would have estranged [Damon]_n56 and [Pythias]_n57. This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to [Mr Utterson]_n58. ""[They]_p295 have only differed on some point of science,"". [he]_p296 thought  and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), [he]_p297 even added:. ""[It]_p298 is nothing worse than that!"". [He]_p299 gave [his]_p300 friend a few seconds to recover [his]_p301 composure, and then approached the question [he]_p302 had come to put. ""Did [you]_p303 ever come across a protege of his, one [Hyde]_n59 ?"".",4,,15,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p304 asked. ""[Hyde]_n60 ?"". repeated [Lanyon]_n61. ""No. Never heard of him. Since [my]_p305 time. That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with [him]_p306 to the great, dark bed on which [he]_p307 tossed to and fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. [It]_p308 was a night of little ease to [his]_p309 toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and beseiged by questions. Six o'clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to [Mr Utterson]_n62 's dwelling, and still [he]_p310 was digging at the problem. Hitherto [it]_p311 had touched [him]_p312 on the intellectual side alone but now [his]_p313 imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved and as [he]_p315 lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, [Mr Enfield]_n63 's tale went by before [his]_p314 mind in a scroll of lighted pictures.",4,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [He]_p316 would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city then of the figure of a man walking swiftly then of a child running from the doctor's and then these met, and that human [Juggernaut]_n64 trod the child down and passed on regardless of [her]_p317 screams. Or else [he]_p318 would see a room in a rich house, where [his]_p320 friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at [his]_p321 dreams and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by [his]_p321 side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, [he]_p319 must rise and do [its]_p323 bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night and if at any time [he]_p324 dozed over, [it]_p325 was but to see [it]_p326 glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave [her]_p327 screaming. And still the figure had no face by which [he]_p328 might know [it]_p329 even in [his]_p332 dreams, [it]_p330 had no face, or one that baffled [him]_p334 and melted before [his]_p333 eyes and thus [it]_p330 was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer's mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real [Mr Hyde]_n65. If [he]_p335 could but once set eyes on him, [he]_p336 thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. [He]_p337 might see a reason for [his]_p338 friend's strange preference or bondage (call [it]_p339 which [you]_p340 please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least [it]_p341 would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show [itself]_p342 to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable [Enfield]_n66 , a spirit of enduring hatred. From that time forward, [Mr Utterson]_n67 began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on [his]_p343 chosen post. ""If [he]_p344 be [Mr Hyde]_n68 ,"".",5,,29,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p345 had thought,. ""[I]_p346 shall be Mr Seek. And at last [his]_p347 patience was rewarded. [It]_p348 was a fine dry night frost in the air the streets as clean as a ballroom floor the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o'clock, when the shops were closed the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of [London]_n69 from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded [him]_p349 by a long time. [Mr Utterson]_n70 had been some minutes at [his]_p350 post, when [he]_p351 was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. In the course of [his]_p352 nightly patrols, [he]_p353 had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while [he]_p354 is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet [his]_p355 attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested and [it]_p356 was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that [he]_p357 withdrew into the entry of the court. The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as [they]_p358 turned the end of the street.",2,,14,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man [he]_p359 had to deal with. [He]_p360 was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher's inclination. But [he]_p361 made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time and as [he]_p362 came, [he]_p362 drew a key from [his]_p364 pocket like one approaching home. [Mr Utterson]_n71 stepped out and touched [him]_p365 on the shoulder as [he]_p366 passed. ""[Mr Hyde]_n72 , [I]_p367 think? [Mr Hyde]_n73 shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But [his]_p368 fear was only momentary and though [he]_p369 did not look the lawyer in the face, [he]_p370 answered coolly enough:. ""That is [my]_p371 name. What do [you]_p372 want?. ""[I]_p373 see [you]_p374 are going in,"". returned the lawyer.",3,,16,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[I]_p375 am an old friend of Dr Jekyll's, Mr Utterson of Gaunt Street, [you]_p377 must have heard of [my]_p380 name and meeting [you]_p378 so conveniently, [I]_p376 thought [you]_p378 might admit me. ""[You]_p381 will not find Dr Jekyll [he]_p382 is from home,"". replied [Mr Hyde]_n74 , blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,. ""How did [you]_p383 know me?"". [he]_p384 asked. ""On [your]_p385 side,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n75. ""will [you]_p386 do [me]_p387 a favour?. ""With pleasure,"".",2,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," replied the other. ""What shall [it]_p388 be?. ""[Will]_n76 [you]_p389 let [me]_p390 see [your]_p391 face?"". asked the lawyer. [Mr Hyde]_n77 appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. ""Now [I]_p392 shall know [you]_p393 again,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n78. ""[It]_p394 may be useful. ""Yes,"". returned [Mr Hyde]_n79 ,.",4,,7,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[It]_p395 is as well [we]_p396 have met and apropos, [you]_p397 should have [my]_p398 address. "". And [he]_p399 gave a number of a street in [Soho]_n80. ""Good God!"". thought [Mr Utterson]_n81 ,. ""can he, too, have been thinking of the will?"". But [he]_p400 kept [his]_p401 feelings to [himself]_p402 and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address. ""And now,"". said the other,. ""how did [you]_p403 know me?.",2,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""By description,"". was the reply. ""Whose description?. ""[We]_p404 have common friends,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n82. ""Common friends,"". echoed [Mr Hyde]_n83 , a little hoarsely. ""Who are they?. ""[Jekyll]_n84 , for instance,"". said the lawyer.",3,,1,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[He]_p405 never told you,"". cried [Mr Hyde]_n85 , with a flush of anger. ""[I]_p406 did not think [you]_p407 would have lied. ""Come,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n86 ,. ""that is not fitting language. The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, [he]_p408 had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house. The lawyer stood awhile when [Mr Hyde]_n87 had left him, the picture of disquietude. Then [he]_p409 began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting [his]_p410 hand to [his]_p411 brow like a man in mental perplexity. The problem [he]_p412 was thus debating as [he]_p413 walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved.",3,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [Mr Hyde]_n88 was pale and dwarfish, [he]_p414 gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, [he]_p415 had a displeasing smile, [he]_p415 had borne [himself]_p418 to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and [he]_p416 spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice all these were points against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which [Mr Utterson]_n89 regarded him. ""There must be something else,"". said the perplexed gentleman. ""There is something more, if [I]_p419 could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall [we]_p420 say? or can [it]_p421 be the old story of [Dr Fell]_n90 ? or is [it]_p422 the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, [its]_p424 clay continent? The last, [I]_p425 think for, O [my]_p427 poor old [Harry Jekyll]_n91 , if ever [I]_p426 read [Satan]_n92 's signature upon a face, [it]_p422 is on that of [your]_p428 new friend. [Round]_n93 the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from [their]_p429 high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though [it]_p430 was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight, [Mr Utterson]_n94 stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door. ""Is Dr Jekyll at home, Poole?"". asked the lawyer.",7,,17,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[I]_p431 will see, [Mr Utterson]_n95 ,"". said [Poole]_n96 , admitting the visitor, as [he]_p432 spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. ""[Will]_n97 [you]_p433 wait here by the fire, sir? or shall [I]_p435 give [you]_p434 a light in the dining-room?. ""Here, thank you,"". said the lawyer, and [he]_p436 drew near and leaned on the tall fender. This hall, in which [he]_p437 was now left alone, was a pet fancy of [his]_p438 friend the doctor's and [Utterson]_n98 [himself]_p439 was wont to speak of [it]_p440 as the pleasantest room in [London]_n99. But tonight there was a shudder in [his]_p441 blood the face of [Hyde]_n100 sat heavy on [his]_p442 memory [he]_p444 felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life and in the gloom of [his]_p442 spirits, [he]_p445 seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. [He]_p446 was ashamed of [his]_p447 relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr Jekyll was gone out. ""[I]_p448 saw [Mr Hyde]_n101 go in by the old dissecting room, [Poole]_n102 ,"". [he]_p449 said.",8,,19,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Is that right, when Dr Jekyll is from home?. ""Quite right, [Mr Utterson]_n103 , sir,"". replied the servant. ""[Mr Hyde]_n104 has a key. ""[Your]_p450 master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man, [Poole]_n105 ,"". resumed the other musingly. ""Yes, sir, [he]_p451 does indeed,"". said [Poole]_n106. ""[We]_p452 have all orders to obey him. ""[I]_p453 do not think [I]_p454 ever met [Mr Hyde]_n107 ?"".",5,,5,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," asked [Utterson]_n108. ""O, dear no, sir. [He]_p455 never dines here,"". replied the butler. ""Indeed [we]_p456 see very little of [him]_p457 on this side of the house [he]_p458 mostly comes and goes by the laboratory. ""Well, good-night, [Poole]_n109. ""Good-night, [Mr Utterson]_n110. And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. ""[Poor Harry Jekyll]_n111 ,"". [he]_p459 thought,.",4,,5,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[my]_p460 mind misgives [me]_p461 [he]_p462 is in deep waters! [He]_p464 was wild when [he]_p463 was young a long while ago to be sure but in the law of God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, [it]_p465 must be that the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, [PEDE CLAUDO]_n112 , years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault. "". And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on [his]_p466 own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by chance some [Jack-in-the-Box]_n113 of an old iniquity should leap to light there. [His]_p467 past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of [their]_p468 life with less apprehension yet [he]_p469 was humbled to the dust by the many ill things [he]_p470 had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many [he]_p470 had come so near to doing yet avoided. And then by a return on [his]_p472 former subject, [he]_p473 conceived a spark of hope. ""This Master [Hyde]_n114 , if [he]_p474 were studied,"". thought he,. ""must have secrets of [his]_p475 own black secrets, by the look of [him]_p476 secrets compared to which poor [Jekyll]_n115 's worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot continue as [they]_p477 are.",4,,18,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p478 turns [me]_p479 cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to [Harry]_n116 's bedside poor [Harry]_n117 , what a wakening! And the danger of [it]_p480 for if this [Hyde]_n118 suspects the existence of the will, [he]_p481 may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, [I]_p482 must put [my]_p483 shoulders to the wheel, if [Jekyll]_n119 will but let me,"". [he]_p484 added,. ""if [Jekyll]_n120 will only let me. "". For once more [he]_p485 saw before [his]_p486 mind's eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will. [DR]_n121. [JEKYLL]_n122 WAS QUITE AT EASE A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of [his]_p487 pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine and [Mr Utterson]_n123 so contrived that [he]_p488 remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where [Utterson]_n124 was liked, [he]_p489 was liked well.",9,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already [their]_p490 foot on the threshold [they]_p492 liked to sit a while in [his]_p493 unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering [their]_p491 minds in the man's rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr Jekyll was no exception and as [he]_p494 now sat on the opposite side of the fire, a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a stylish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness, [you]_p496 could see by [his]_p497 looks that [he]_p495 cherished for Mr Utterson a sincere and warm affection. ""[I]_p498 have been wanting to speak to you, [Jekyll]_n125 ,"". began the latter. ""[You]_p499 know that will of yours?   A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful but the doctor carried [it]_p500 off gaily. ""[My]_p501 poor [Utterson]_n126 ,"". said he,. ""[you]_p502 are unfortunate in such a client. [I]_p503 never saw a man so distressed as [you]_p504 were by [my]_p505 will unless [it]_p507 were that hide-bound pedant, [Lanyon]_n127 , at what [he]_p508 called [my]_p506 scientific heresies. O, [I]_p509 know he's a good fellow, [you]_p511 needn't frown, an excellent fellow, and [I]_p510 always mean to see more of [him]_p512 but a hide-bound pedant for all that an ignorant, blatant pedant.",3,,23,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p513 was never more disappointed in any man than [Lanyon]_n128. ""[You]_p514 know [I]_p515 never approved of it,"". pursued [Utterson]_n129 , ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic. ""[My]_p516 will? Yes, certainly, [I]_p517 know that,"". said the doctor, a trifle sharply. ""[You]_p518 have told [me]_p519 so. ""Well, [I]_p520 tell [you]_p521 so again,"". continued the lawyer. ""[I]_p522 have been learning something of young [Hyde]_n130. The large handsome face of Dr Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about [his]_p523 eyes.",3,,11,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[I]_p524 do not care to hear more,  said he. ""This is a matter [I]_p525 thought [we]_p526 had agreed to drop. ""What [I]_p527 heard was abominable,"". said [Utterson]_n131. ""[It]_p528 can make no change. [You]_p529 do not understand [my]_p530 position,"". returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. ""[I]_p531 am painfully situated, [Utterson]_n132 [my]_p532 position is a very strange, a very strange one. [It]_p533 is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.

Make a clean breast of this in confidence and [I]_p536 make no doubt [I]_p537 can get [you]_p538 out of it. ""[My]_p539 good [Utterson]_n135 ,"". said the doctor,. ""this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and [I]_p543 cannot find words to thank [you]_p540 in. [I]_p544 believe [you]_p550 fully [I]_p545 would trust [you]_p551 before any man alive, ay, before myself, if [I]_p545 could make the choice but indeed [it]_p554 isn't what [you]_p551 fancy [it]_p555 is not as bad as that and just to put [your]_p556 good heart at rest, [I]_p546 will tell [you]_p552 one thing: the moment [I]_p546 choose, [I]_p546 can be rid of [Mr Hyde]_n136. [I]_p557 give [you]_p562 [my]_p566 hand upon that and [I]_p558 thank [you]_p563 again and again and [I]_p558 will just add one little word, [Utterson]_n137 , that I'm sure you'll take in good part: this is a private matter, and [I]_p559 beg of [you]_p563 to let [it]_p567 sleep. [Utterson]_n138 reflected a little, looking in the fire. ""[I]_p568 have no doubt [you]_p569 are perfectly right,"".",5,,32,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p570 said at last, getting to [his]_p571 feet. ""Well, but since [we]_p572 have touched upon this business, and for the last time [I]_p573 hope,"". continued the doctor,. ""there is one point [I]_p574 should like [you]_p575 to understand. [I]_p576 have really a very great interest in poor [Hyde]_n139. [I]_p577 know [you]_p579 have seen [him]_p580 [he]_p581 told [me]_p583 so and [I]_p578 fear [he]_p582 was rude. But [I]_p584 do sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man and if [I]_p585 am taken away, [Utterson]_n140 , [I]_p585 wish [you]_p587 to promise [me]_p589 that [you]_p588 will bear with [him]_p590 and get [his]_p592 rights for him. [I]_p593 think [you]_p594 would, if [you]_p595 knew all  and [it]_p597 would be a weight off [my]_p598 mind if [you]_p595 would promise. ""[I]_p599 can't pretend that [I]_p600 shall ever like him,"". said the lawyer.",2,,30,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[I]_p601 don't ask that,"". pleaded [Jekyll]_n141 , laying [his]_p602 hand upon the other's arm. ""[I]_p603 only ask for justice [I]_p604 only ask [you]_p606 to help [him]_p607 for [my]_p608 sake, when [I]_p604 am no longer here. [Utterson]_n142 heaved an irrepressible sigh. ""Well,"". said he,. ""[I]_p609 promise. THE CAREW [MURDER CASE]_n143 Nearly a year later, in the month of [October]_n144 , 18, , [London]_n145 was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven.",5,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid's window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. [It]_p610 seems [she]_p611 was romantically given, for [she]_p612 sat down upon [her]_p613 box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when [she]_p614 narrated that experience), never had [she]_p615 felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world. And as [she]_p617 so sat [she]_p618 became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at first [she]_p618 paid less attention. When [they]_p620 had come within speech (which was just under the maid's eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness. [It]_p621 did not seem as if the subject of [his]_p622 address were of great importance indeed, from [his]_p623 pointing, [it]_p626 some times appeared as if [he]_p629 were only inquiring [his]_p623 way  but the moon shone on [his]_p624 face as [he]_p630 spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, [it]_p627 seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently [her]_p631 eye wandered to the other, and [she]_p633 was surprised to recognise in [him]_p635 a certain [Mr Hyde]_n146 , who had once visited [her]_p632 master and for whom [she]_p634 had conceived a dislike. [He]_p636 had in [his]_p637 hand a heavy cane, with which [he]_p638 was trifling but [he]_p639 answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden [he]_p640 broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with [his]_p641 foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt and at that [Mr Hyde]_n147 broke out of all bounds and clubbed [him]_p642 to the earth.",2,,31,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," And next moment, with ape-like fury, [he]_p643 was trampling [his]_p644 victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted. [It]_p645 was two o'clock when [she]_p646 came to [herself]_p647 and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago but there lay [his]_p648 victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been done, although [it]_p649 was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter, the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which [he]_p650 had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of [Mr Utterson]_n148. This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before [he]_p651 was out of bed and [he]_p652 had no sooner seen [it]_p654 and been told the circumstances, than [he]_p652 shot out a solemn lip. ""[I]_p655 shall say nothing till [I]_p656 have seen the body,"". said [he]_p657. ""this may be very serious.",1,,15,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Have the kindness to wait while [I]_p658 dress. "". And with the same grave countenance [he]_p659 hurried through [his]_p660 breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been carried. As soon as [he]_p661 came into the cell, [he]_p662 nodded. ""Yes,"". said he,. ""[I]_p663 recognise him. [I]_p664 am sorry to say that this is [Sir Danvers Carew]_n149. ""Good God, sir,"". exclaimed the officer,.",1,,7,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""is [it]_p665 possible?"". And the next moment [his]_p666 eye lighted up with professional ambition. ""This will make a deal of noise,"". [he]_p667 said. ""And perhaps [you]_p668 can help [us]_p669 to the man. "". And [he]_p670 briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick. [Mr Utterson]_n150 had already quailed at the name of [Hyde]_n151 but when the stick was laid before him, [he]_p671 could doubt no longer broken and battered as [it]_p674 was, [he]_p672 recognized [it]_p675 for one that [he]_p672 had [himself]_p676 presented many years before to [Henry Jekyll]_n152. ""Is this [Mr Hyde]_n153 a person of small stature?"". [he]_p677 inquired.",4,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid calls him,"". said the officer. [Mr Utterson]_n154 reflected and then, raising [his]_p678 head,. ""If [you]_p679 will come with [me]_p680 in [my]_p681 cab,"". [he]_p682 said,. ""[I]_p683 think [I]_p684 can take [you]_p685 to [his]_p686 house. [It]_p687 was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours so that as the cab crawled from street to street, [Mr Utterson]_n155 beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight for here [it]_p688 would be dark like the back-end of evening and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal quarter of [Soho]_n156 seen under these changing glimpses, with [its]_p689 muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and [its]_p690 lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer's eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of [his]_p691 mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye and when [he]_p693 glanced at the companion of [his]_p692 drive, [he]_p694 was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law's officers, which may at times assail the most honest.",3,,17,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed [him]_p695 a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut [him]_p696 off from [his]_p697 blackguardly surroundings. This was the home of [Henry Jekyll]_n157 's favourite of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling. An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. [She]_p698 had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but [her]_p699 manners were excellent. Yes, [she]_p700 said, this was [Mr Hyde]_n158 's, but [he]_p702 was not at home [he]_p703 had been in that night very late, but [he]_p703 had gone away again in less than an hour there was nothing strange in that [his]_p706 habits were very irregular, and [he]_p704 was often absent for instance, [it]_p707 was nearly two months since [she]_p701 had seen [him]_p708 till yesterday. ""Very well, then, [we]_p709 wish to see [his]_p710 rooms,"". said the lawyer and when the woman began to declare [it]_p711 was impossible,. ""[I]_p712 had better tell [you]_p713 who this person is,"". [he]_p714 added. ""This is [Inspector Newcomen]_n159 of [Scotland Yard]_n160.",4,,20,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman's face. ""[Ah]_n161 !"". said she,. ""[he]_p715 is in trouble! What has [he]_p716 done? [Mr Utterson]_n162 and the inspector exchanged glances. ""[He]_p717 don't seem a very popular character,"". observed the latter. ""And now, [my]_p718 good woman, just let [me]_p719 and this gentleman have a look about us. In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, [Mr Hyde]_n163 had only used a couple of rooms but these were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with wine the plate was of silver, the napery elegant a good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as [Utterson]_n164 supposed) from [Henry Jekyll]_n165 , who was much of a connoisseur and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked clothes lay about the floor, with [their]_p720 pockets inside out lock-fast drawers stood open and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned.",5,,6,

A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's credit, completed [his]_p723 gratification. ""[You]_p724 may depend upon it, sir,"". [he]_p725 told [Mr Utterson]_n166 :. ""[I]_p726 have [him]_p727 in [my]_p728 hand. [He]_p729 must have lost [his]_p730 head, or [he]_p731 never would have left the stick or, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money's life to the man. [We]_p732 have nothing to do but wait for [him]_p733 at the bank, and get out the handbills. This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment for [Mr Hyde]_n167 had numbered few familiars, even the master of the servant maid had only seen [him]_p734 twice [his]_p736 family could nowhere be traced [he]_p737 had never been photographed and the few who could describe [him]_p735 differed widely, as common observers will. Only on one point were [they]_p738 agreed and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed [his]_p739 beholders.",2,,19,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," INCIDENT OF THE LETTER   [It]_p740 was late in the afternoon, when Mr Utterson found [his]_p741 way to Dr Jekyll's door, where [he]_p742 was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon and [his]_p743 own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden. [It]_p744 was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of [his]_p745 friend's quarters and [he]_p746 eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as [he]_p747 crossed the [theatre]_n168 , once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize and through this, [Mr Utterson]_n169 was at last received into the doctor's cabinet. [It]_p748 was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The fire burned in the grate a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr Jekyll, looking deathly sick. [He]_p749 did not rise to meet [his]_p750 visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade [him]_p751 welcome in a changed voice. ""And now,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n170 , as soon as [Poole]_n171 had left them,. ""[you]_p752 have heard the news?   The doctor shuddered.",4,,13,

""One word,"". said the lawyer. ""[Carew]_n172 was [my]_p759 client, but so are you, and [I]_p760 want to know what [I]_p761 am doing. [You]_p762 have not been mad enough to hide this fellow?.

The lawyer listened gloomily [he]_p782 did not like [his]_p783 friend's feverish manner. ""[You]_p784 seem pretty sure of him,"". said [he]_p785. ""and for [your]_p786 sake, [I]_p787 hope [you]_p788 may be right. If [it]_p789 came to a trial, [your]_p790 name might appear. ""[I]_p791 am quite sure of him,"". replied [Jekyll]_n174.",1,,25,

[I]_p800 should like to leave [it]_p803 in [your]_p804 hands, [Utterson]_n175 [you]_p805 would judge wisely, [I]_p801 am sure [I]_p801 have so great a trust in you. ""[You]_p807 fear, [I]_p808 suppose, that [it]_p809 might lead to [his]_p810 detection?"". asked the lawyer. ""No,"". said the other. ""[I]_p811 cannot say that [I]_p812 care what becomes of [Hyde]_n176 [I]_p812 am quite done with him.

stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [Utterson]_n177 ruminated awhile [he]_p816 was surprised at [his]_p817 friend's selfishness, and yet relieved by it. ""Well,"". said he, at last,. ""let [me]_p818 see the letter. The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed. ""Edward Hyde : and [it]_p819 signified, briefly enough, that the writer's benefactor, Dr Jekyll, whom [he]_p820 had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for [his]_p823 safety, as [he]_p821 had means of escape on which [he]_p821 placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked this letter well enough [it]_p824 put a better colour on the intimacy than [he]_p825 had looked for and [he]_p826 blamed [himself]_p827 for some of [his]_p828 past suspicions. ""Have [you]_p829 the envelope?"". [he]_p830 asked. ""[I]_p831 burned it,"".",1,,16,

""Shall [I]_p835 keep this and sleep upon it?"". asked [Utterson]_n179. ""[I]_p836 wish [you]_p837 to judge for [me]_p838 entirely,"". was the reply. ""[I]_p839 have lost confidence in myself. ""Well, [I]_p840 shall consider,"".",2,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," returned the lawyer. ""And now one word more: [it]_p841 was [Hyde]_n180 who dictated the terms in [your]_p842 will about that disappearance? The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness [he]_p843 shut [his]_p844 mouth tight and nodded. ""[I]_p845 knew it,"". said [Utterson]_n181. ""[He]_p846 meant to murder you. [You]_p847 had a fine escape. ""[I]_p848 have had what is far more to the purpose,"". returned the doctor solemnly:. ""[I]_p849 have had a lesson, O God, [Utterson]_n182 , what a lesson [I]_p850 have had!"". And [he]_p851 covered [his]_p852 face for a moment with [his]_p853 hands.",3,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," On [his]_p854 way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with [Poole]_n183. ""By the bye,"". said he,. ""there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger like?"". But [Poole]_n184 was positive nothing had come except by post. ""and only circulars by that,"". [he]_p855 added. This news sent off the visitor with [his]_p856 fears renewed. Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door possibly, indeed, [it]_p857 had been written in the cabinet and if that were so, [it]_p858 must be differently judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as [he]_p859 went, were crying [themselves]_p860 hoarse along the footways:.",2,,7,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Special edition. Shocking murder of an M. P. "". That was the funeral oration of one friend and client and [he]_p861 could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. [It]_p862 was, at least, a ticklish decision that [he]_p863 had to make and self-reliant as [he]_p864 was by habit, [he]_p864 began to cherish a longing for advice. [It]_p866 was not to be had directly but perhaps, [he]_p867 thought, [it]_p868 might be fished for. Presently after, [he]_p869 sat on one side of [his]_p870 own hearth, with [Mr Guest]_n185 , [his]_p871 head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of [his]_p871 house. The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds, the procession of the town's life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the room was gay with firelight.",1,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," In the bottle the acids were long ago resolved the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows richer in stained windows and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of [London]_n186. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom [he]_p873 kept fewer secrets than [Mr Guest]_n187 and [he]_p874 was not always sure that [he]_p874 kept as many as [he]_p875 meant. [Guest]_n188 had often been on business to the doctor's [he]_p877 knew [Poole]_n189 [he]_p878 could scarce have failed to hear of [Mr Hyde]_n190 's familiarity about the house [he]_p878 might draw conclusions: was [it]_p882 not as well, then, that [he]_p879 should see a letter which put that mystery to right? and above all since [Guest]_n191 , being a great student and critic of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The clerk, besides, was a man of counsel [he]_p879 could scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark and by that remark [Mr Utterson]_n192 might shape [his]_p883 future course. ""This is a sad business about [Sir Danvers]_n193 ,"". [he]_p884 said. ""Yes, sir, indeed. [It]_p885 has elicited a great deal of public feeling, returned [Guest]_n194. ""The man, of course, was mad. ""[I]_p886 should like to hear [your]_p887 views on that,"".",9,,15,

""[I]_p888 have a document here in [his]_p890 handwriting [it]_p891 is between ourselves, for [I]_p889 scarce know what to do about [it]_p892 [it]_p893 is an ugly business at the best. But there [it]_p894 is quite in [your]_p895 way: a murderer's autograph. [Guest]_n196 's eyes brightened, and [he]_p896 sat down at once and studied [it]_p897 with passion. ""No sir,"". [he]_p898 said:. ""not mad but [it]_p899 is an odd hand. ""And by all accounts a very odd writer,"". added the lawyer. Just then the servant entered with a note.",2,,12,

""Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do [you]_p902 want to see it?. ""One moment.

[LANYON]_n206 Time ran on thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death of [Sir Danvers]_n207 was resented as a public injury but [Mr Hyde]_n208 had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though [he]_p919 had never existed. Much of [his]_p920 past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came out of the man's cruelty, at once so callous and violent of [his]_p921 vile life, of [his]_p921 strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded [his]_p922 career but of [his]_p922 present whereabouts, not a whisper. From the time [he]_p925 had left the house in [Soho]_n209 on the morning of the murder, [he]_p926 was simply blotted out and gradually, as time drew on, [Mr Utterson]_n210 began to recover from the hotness of [his]_p927 alarm, and to grow more at quiet with himself. The death of [Sir Danvers]_n211 was, to [his]_p928 way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of [Mr Hyde]_n212. Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr Jekyll. [He]_p929 came out of [his]_p930 seclusion, renewed relations with [his]_p931 friends, became once more [their]_p932 familiar guest and entertainer and whilst [he]_p933 had always been known for charities, [he]_p934 was now no less distinguished for religion. [He]_p935 was busy, [he]_p936 was much in the open air, [he]_p937 did good [his]_p938 face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace.",10,,22,

On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against the lawyer. ""The doctor was confined to the house,"". [Poole]_n215 said,. ""and saw no one. "". On the 15th, [he]_p939 tried again, and was again refused and having now been used for the last two months to see [his]_p941 friend almost daily, [he]_p940 found this return of solitude to weigh upon [his]_p942 spirits. The fifth night [he]_p943 had in [Guest]_n216 to dine with [him]_p945 and the sixth [he]_p944 betook [himself]_p946 to [Dr Lanyon]_n217 's. There at least [he]_p947 was not denied admittance but when [he]_p948 came in, [he]_p948 was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor's appearance. [He]_p950 had [his]_p951 death-warrant written legibly upon [his]_p952 face.",5,,14,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," The rosy man had grown pale [his]_p953 flesh had fallen away [he]_p954 was visibly balder and older  and yet [it]_p955 was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer's notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. [It]_p956 was unlikely that the doctor should fear death and yet that was what [Utterson]_n218 was tempted to suspect. ""Yes,"". [he]_p957 thought. ""[he]_p958 is a doctor, [he]_p959 must know [his]_p961 own state and that [his]_p962 days are counted and the knowledge is more than [he]_p959 can bear. "". And yet when [Utterson]_n219 remarked on [his]_p963 ill-looks, [it]_p964 was with an air of great firmness that [Lanyon]_n220 declared [himself]_p965 a doomed man. ""[I]_p966 have had a shock,"".

As soon as [he]_p999 got home, [Utterson]_n229 sat down and wrote to [Jekyll]_n230 , complaining of [his]_p1000 exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break with [Lanyon]_n231 and the next day brought [him]_p1001 a long answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift. The quarrel with [Lanyon]_n232 was incurable. ""[I]_p1002 do not blame [our]_p1003 old friend,"". [Jekyll]_n233 wrote,. ""but [I]_p1004 share [his]_p1005 view that [we]_p1006 must never meet.

[I]_p1021 could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning and [you]_p1022 can do but one thing, [Utterson]_n234 , to lighten this destiny, and that is to respect [my]_p1023 silence. "". [Utterson]_n235 was amazed the dark influence of [Hyde]_n236 had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to [his]_p1024 old tasks and amities a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of [his]_p1025 life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness but in view of [Lanyon]_n237 's manner and words, there must lie for [it]_p1026 some deeper ground. A week afterwards [Dr Lanyon]_n238 took to [his]_p1027 bed, and in something less than a fortnight [he]_p1028 was dead. The night after the funeral, at which [he]_p1029 had been sadly affected, [Utterson]_n239 locked the door of [his]_p1030 business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before [him]_p1032 an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of [his]_p1031 dead friend.

A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries but professional honour and faith to [his]_p1045 dead friend were stringent obligations and the packet slept in the inmost corner of [his]_p1046 private safe.

[Poole]_n248 had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate.

stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""And by the way, what an ass [you]_p1081 must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr Jekyll's! [It]_p1082 was partly [your]_p1083 own fault that [I]_p1084 found [it]_p1086 out, even when [I]_p1085 did. ""So [you]_p1087 found [it]_p1089 out, did you?"". said [Utterson]_n259. ""But if that be so, [we]_p1090 may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell [you]_p1091 the truth, [I]_p1092 am uneasy about poor [Jekyll]_n260 and even outside, [I]_p1093 feel as if the presence of a friend might do [him]_p1094 good. The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr Jekyll. ""What! [Jekyll]_n261 !"". [he]_p1095 cried. ""[I]_p1096 trust [you]_p1097 are better.",3,,16,

""Why, then,"". said the lawyer, good-naturedly,. ""the best thing [we]_p1112 can do is to stay down here and speak with [you]_p1114 from where [we]_p1113 are. ""That is just what [I]_p1115 was about to venture to propose,"". returned the doctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile was struck out of [his]_p1116 face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below. [They]_p1117 saw [it]_p1118 but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down  but that glimpse had been sufficient, and [they]_p1119 turned and left the court without a word.",2,,15,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," In silence, too, [they]_p1120 traversed the by-street and [it]_p1122 was not until [they]_p1121 had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon a [Sunday]_n266 there were still some stirrings of life, that [Mr Utterson]_n267 at last turned and looked at [his]_p1123 companion. [They]_p1124 were both pale and there was an answering horror in [their]_p1125 eyes. ""God forgive us, God forgive us,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n268. But [Mr Enfield]_n269 only nodded [his]_p1126 head very seriously, and walked on once more in silence. THE LAST NIGHT [Mr Utterson]_n270 was sitting by [his]_p1127 fireside one evening after dinner, when [he]_p1128 was surprised to receive a visit from [Poole]_n271. ""Bless me, [Poole]_n272 , what brings [you]_p1129 here?"". [he]_p1130 cried and then taking a second look at him,. ""What ails you?"". [he]_p1131 added.",7,,12,

stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Even now, [he]_p1151 sat with the glass of wine untasted on [his]_p1152 knee, and [his]_p1153 eyes directed to a corner of the floor. ""[I]_p1154 can bear [it]_p1155 no more,"". [he]_p1156 repeated. ""Come,"". said the lawyer,. ""[I]_p1157 see [you]_p1159 have some good reason, [Poole]_n277 [I]_p1158 see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell [me]_p1160 what [it]_p1161 is.

[Mr Utterson]_n280 's only answer was to rise and get [his]_p1166 hat and greatcoat but [he]_p1167 observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butler's face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was still untasted when [he]_p1168 set [it]_p1169 down to follow. [It]_p1170 was a wild, cold, seasonable night of [March]_n281 , with a pale moon, lying on [her]_p1171 back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. [It]_p1173 seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides for [Mr Utterson]_n282 thought [he]_p1174 had never seen that part of [London]_n283 so deserted. [He]_p1175 could have wished [it]_p1176 otherwise never in [his]_p1177 life had [he]_p1180 been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch [his]_p1178 fellow-creatures for struggle as [he]_p1181 might, there was borne in upon [his]_p1178 mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square, when [they]_p1182 got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing [themselves]_p1183 along the railing.",4,,20,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [Poole]_n284 , who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off [his]_p1184 hat and mopped [his]_p1185 brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of [his]_p1186 coming, these were not the dews of exertion that [he]_p1189 wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish for [his]_p1187 face was white and [his]_p1187 voice, when [he]_p1190 spoke, harsh and broken. ""Well, sir,"". [he]_p1191 said,. ""here [we]_p1192 are, and God grant there be nothing wrong. ""Amen, [Poole]_n285 ,"". said the lawyer. Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner the door was opened on the chain and a voice asked from within,. ""Is that you, [Poole]_n286 ?. ""It's all right,"".",3,,9,

The hall, when [they]_p1193 entered it, was brightly lighted up the fire was built high and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of [Mr Utterson]_n288 , the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering and the cook, crying out. ""[Bless God]_n289 ! it's [Mr Utterson]_n290 ,"". ran forward as if to take [him]_p1194 in [her]_p1195 arms. ""What, what? Are [you]_p1196 all here?"". said the lawyer peevishly.

""Hold [your]_p1199 tongue!"". [Poole]_n293 said to her, with a ferocity of accent that testified to [his]_p1202 own jangled nerves and indeed, when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of [her]_p1200 lamentation, [they]_p1203 had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. ""And now,"". continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy,. ""reach [me]_p1204 a candle, and we'll get this through hands at once. "".

And see here, sir, if by any chance [he]_p1212 was to ask [you]_p1213 in, don't go. [Mr Utterson]_n295 's nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk that nearly threw [him]_p1214 from [his]_p1215 balance but [he]_p1217 recollected [his]_p1216 courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the surgical [theatre]_n296 , with [its]_p1218 lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of the stair. Here [Poole]_n297 motioned [him]_p1219 to stand on one side and listen while [he]_p1220 himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on [his]_p1221 resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door. ""[Mr Utterson]_n298 , sir, asking to see you,"". [he]_p1222 called and even as [he]_p1223 did so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear. A voice answered from within:.

""Sir,"". [he]_p1230 said, looking [Mr Utterson]_n301 in the eyes,. ""Was that [my]_p1231 master's voice?. ""[It]_p1232 seems much changed,"". replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look for look.

""This is a very strange tale, [Poole]_n305 this is rather a wild tale [my]_p1241 man, said [Mr Utterson]_n306 , biting [his]_p1242 finger.

stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""So [it]_p1431 will walk all day, sir,"". whispered [Poole]_n348. ""ay, and the better part of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist, there's a bit of a break. [Ah]_n349 , it's an ill conscience that's such an enemy to rest! [Ah]_n350 , sir, there's blood foully shed in every step of it! But hark again, a little closer, put [your]_p1435 heart in [your]_p1436 ears, [Mr Utterson]_n351 , and tell me, is that the doctor's foot? The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all [they]_p1437 went so slowly [it]_p1432 was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of [Henry Jekyll]_n352. [Utterson]_n353 sighed. ""Is there never anything else?"". [he]_p1438 asked. [Poole]_n354 nodded. ""Once,"".",7,,6,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p1439 said. ""Once [I]_p1440 heard [it]_p1441 weeping!. ""Weeping? how that?"". said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of horror. ""Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,"". said the butler. ""[I]_p1442 came away with that upon [my]_p1444 heart, that [I]_p1443 could have wept too. But now the ten minutes drew to an end. [Poole]_n355 disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw the candle was set upon the nearest table to light [them]_p1445 to the attack and [they]_p1446 drew near with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in the quiet of the night. ""[Jekyll]_n356 ,"".",2,,8,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," cried [Utterson]_n357 , with a loud voice,. ""[I]_p1447 demand to see you. "". [He]_p1448 paused a moment, but there came no reply. ""[I]_p1449 give [you]_p1451 fair warning, [our]_p1453 suspicions are aroused, and [I]_p1450 must and shall see you,"". [he]_p1454 resumed. ""if not by fair means, then by foul, if not of [your]_p1455 consent, then by brute force!. ""[Utterson]_n358 ,"". said the voice,. ""for God's sake, have mercy!.",2,,8,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[Ah]_n359 , that's not [Jekyll]_n360 's voice, it's [Hyde]_n361 's!"". cried [Utterson]_n362. ""Down with the door, [Poole]_n363 ! [Poole]_n364 swung the axe over [his]_p1456 shoulder the blow shook the building, and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded four times the blow fell but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship and [it]_p1457 was not until the fifth, that the lock burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet. The besiegers, appalled by [their]_p1458 own riot and the stillness that had succeeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet before [their]_p1459 eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing [its]_p1460 thin strain, a drawer or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer the fire, the things laid out for tea the quietest room, [you]_p1461 would have said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most commonplace that night in [London]_n365. Right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and still twitching. [They]_p1462 drew near on tiptoe, turned [it]_p1463 on [its]_p1464 back and beheld the face of [Edward Hyde]_n366. [He]_p1465 was dressed in clothes far too large for him, clothes of the doctor's bigness the cords of [his]_p1466 face still moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone: and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air, [Utterson]_n367 knew that [he]_p1467 was looking on the body of a self-destroyer.",9,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[We]_p1468 have come too late,"". [he]_p1469 said sternly,. ""whether to save or punish. [Hyde]_n368 is gone to [his]_p1470 account and [it]_p1471 only remains for [us]_p1472 to find the body of [your]_p1473 master. The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the [theatre]_n369 , which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end and looked upon the court. A corridor joined the [theatre]_n370 to the door on the by-street and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these [they]_p1474 now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from [their]_p1475 doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was [Jekyll]_n371 's predecessor but even as [they]_p1476 opened the door [they]_p1477 were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.",4,,10,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," No where was there any trace of [Henry Jekyll]_n372 dead or alive. [Poole]_n373 stamped on the flags of the corridor. ""[He]_p1478 must be buried here,"". [he]_p1479 said, hearkening to the sound. ""Or [he]_p1480 may have fled,"". said [Utterson]_n374 , and [he]_p1481 turned to examine the door in the by-street. [It]_p1482 was locked and lying near by on the flags, [they]_p1483 found the key, already stained with rust. ""This does not look like use,"". observed the lawyer. ""Use!"".",3,,6,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," echoed [Poole]_n375. ""Do [you]_p1484 not see, sir, [it]_p1485 is broken? much as if a man had stamped on it. ""Ay,"". continued [Utterson]_n376 ,. ""and the fractures, too, are rusty. "". The two men looked at each other with a scare. ""This is beyond me, [Poole]_n377 ,"". said the lawyer. ""Let [us]_p1487 go back to the cabinet.",3,,3,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [They]_p1488 mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented. ""That is the same drug that [I]_p1489 was always bringing him,"". said [Poole]_n378 and even as [he]_p1490 spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over. This brought [them]_p1491 to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter's elbow, the very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf one lay beside the tea things open, and [Utterson]_n379 was amazed to find [it]_p1492 a copy of a pious work, for which [Jekyll]_n380 had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in [his]_p1493 own hand with startling blasphemies. Next, in the course of [their]_p1494 review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths [they]_p1495 looked with an involuntary horror. But [it]_p1496 was so turned as to show [them]_p1497 nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and [their]_p1498 own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in. ""This glass has seen some strange things, sir,"". whispered [Poole]_n381.",4,,11,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""And surely none stranger than itself,"". echoed the lawyer in the same tones. ""For what did [Jekyll]_n382 , [he]_p1499 caught [himself]_p1500 up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness,. ""what could [Jekyll]_n383 want with it?"". [he]_p1501 said. ""[You]_p1502 may say that!"". said [Poole]_n384. Next [they]_p1503 turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor's hand, the name of [Mr Utterson]_n385. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor.",4,,5,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which [he]_p1504 had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance but in place of the name of [Edward Hyde]_n386 , the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of [Gabriel John Utterson]_n387. [He]_p1505 looked at [Poole]_n388 , and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet. ""[My]_p1506 head goes round,"". [he]_p1507 said. ""[He]_p1508 has been all these days in possession [he]_p1509 had no cause to like [me]_p1512 [he]_p1510 must have raged to see [himself]_p1513 displaced and [he]_p1510 has not destroyed this document. [He]_p1514 caught up the next paper [it]_p1515 was a brief note in the doctor's hand and dated at the top. ""O [Poole]_n389 !"". the lawyer cried,. ""[he]_p1516 was alive and here this day. [He]_p1517 cannot have been disposed of in so short a space [he]_p1518 must be still alive, [he]_p1519 must have fled! And then, why fled? and how? and in that case, can [we]_p1520 venture to declare this suicide? O, [we]_p1521 must be careful.",4,,18,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p1522 foresee that [we]_p1523 may yet involve [your]_p1524 master in some dire catastrophe. ""Why don't [you]_p1525 read it, sir?"". asked [Poole]_n390. ""Because [I]_p1526 fear,"". replied the lawyer solemnly. ""God grant [I]_p1527 have no cause for it!"". And with that [he]_p1528 brought the paper to [his]_p1529 eyes and read as follows:. ""[My]_p1530 dear [Utterson]_n391 ,, When this shall fall into [your]_p1531 hands, [I]_p1532 shall have disappeared, under what circumstances [I]_p1533 have not the penetration to foresee, but [my]_p1534 instinct and all the circumstances of [my]_p1535 nameless situation tell [me]_p1536 that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and first read the narrative which [Lanyon]_n392 warned [me]_p1537 [he]_p1538 was to place in [your]_p1539 hands and if [you]_p1540 care to hear more, turn to the confession of. ""[Your]_p1541 unworthy and unhappy friend,.",3,,20,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""HENRY [JEKYLL]_n393. ""There was a third enclosure?"". asked [Utterson]_n394. ""Here, sir,"". said [Poole]_n395 , and gave into [his]_p1542 hands a considerable packet sealed in several places. The lawyer put [it]_p1543 in [his]_p1544 pocket. ""[I]_p1545 would say nothing of this paper. If [your]_p1546 master has fled or is dead, [we]_p1547 may at least save [his]_p1548 credit. [It]_p1549 is now ten [I]_p1550 must go home and read these documents in quiet but [I]_p1551 shall be back before midnight, when [we]_p1552 shall send for the police. [They]_p1553 went out, locking the door of the [theatre]_n396 behind [them]_p1554 and [Utterson]_n397 , once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall, trudged back to [his]_p1555 office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained.",5,,14,

[LANYON]_n399 'S NARRATIVE On the ninth of [January]_n400 , now four days ago, [I]_p1556 received by the evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of [my]_p1557 colleague and old school companion, [Henry Jekyll]_n401. [I]_p1558 was a good deal surprised by this for [we]_p1561 were by no means in the habit of correspondence [I]_p1559 had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before and [I]_p1559 could imagine nothing in [our]_p1562 intercourse that should justify formality of registration. The contents increased [my]_p1563 wonder for this is how the letter ran:. ""10th [December]_n402 , 18,. ""[Dear Lanyon]_n403 ,, [You]_p1564 are one of [my]_p1565 oldest friends and although [we]_p1567 may have differed at times on scientific questions, [I]_p1568 cannot remember, at least on [my]_p1566 side, any break in [our]_p1569 affection. There was never a day when, if [you]_p1570 had said to me, `[Jekyll]_n404 , [my]_p1573 life, [my]_p1574 honour, [my]_p1574 reason, depend upon you,' [I]_p1577 would not have sacrificed [my]_p1575 left hand to help you. [Lanyon]_n405 [my]_p1578 life, [my]_p1579 honour, [my]_p1579 reason, are all at [your]_p1581 mercy if [you]_p1582 fail [me]_p1583 to-night, [I]_p1584 am lost. [You]_p1585 might suppose, after this preface, that [I]_p1586 am going to ask [you]_p1587 for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for yourself.",8,,30,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[I]_p1588 want [you]_p1589 to postpone all other engagements for to-night, ay, even if [you]_p1590 were summoned to the bedside of an emperor to take a cab, unless [your]_p1591 carriage should be actually at the door and with this letter in [your]_p1592 hand for consultation, to drive straight to [my]_p1593 house. [Poole]_n406 , [my]_p1594 butler, has [his]_p1595 orders [you]_p1596 will find [him]_p1597 waiting [your]_p1598 arrival with a locksmith. The door of [my]_p1599 cabinet is then to be forced: and [you]_p1600 are to go in alone to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if [it]_p1601 be shut and to draw out, with all [its]_p1602 contents as [they]_p1603 stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom. In [my]_p1604 extreme distress of mind, [I]_p1605 have a morbid fear of misdirecting [you]_p1607 but even if [I]_p1606 am in error, [you]_p1608 may know the right drawer by [its]_p1609 contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book. This drawer [I]_p1610 beg of [you]_p1611 to carry back with [you]_p1612 to [Cavendish Square]_n407 exactly as [it]_p1613 stands. ""That is the first part of the service: now for the second. [You]_p1614 should be back, if [you]_p1615 set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight but [I]_p1617 will leave [you]_p1616 that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when [your]_p1618 servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, [I]_p1619 have to ask [you]_p1620 to be alone in [your]_p1623 consulting room, to admit with [your]_p1624 own hand into the house a man who will present [himself]_p1625 in [my]_p1626 name, and to place in [his]_p1628 hands the drawer that [you]_p1621 will have brought with [you]_p1621 from [my]_p1627 cabinet. Then [you]_p1629 will have played [your]_p1630 part and earned [my]_p1631 gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if [you]_p1632 insist upon an explanation, [you]_p1633 will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as [they]_p1635 must appear, [you]_p1633 might have charged [your]_p1636 conscience with [my]_p1637 death or the shipwreck of [my]_p1638 reason.",2,,51,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Confident as [I]_p1639 am that [you]_p1640 will not trifle with this appeal, [my]_p1641 heart sinks and [my]_p1642 hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility. Think of [me]_p1643 at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if [you]_p1645 will but punctually serve me, [my]_p1646 troubles will roll away like a story that is told. Serve me, [my]_p1647 dear [Lanyon]_n408 and save. ""[Your]_p1648 friend,. ""H. J. ""P. S. , [I]_p1649 had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon [my]_p1650 soul.

stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," In that case, dear [Lanyon]_n409 , do [my]_p1653 errand when [it]_p1655 shall be most convenient for [you]_p1656 in the course of the day and once more expect [my]_p1654 messenger at midnight. [It]_p1657 may then already be too late and if that night passes without event, [you]_p1658 will know that [you]_p1659 have seen the last of [Henry Jekyll]_n410. Upon the reading of this letter, [I]_p1660 made sure [my]_p1662 colleague was insane  but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, [I]_p1661 felt bound to do as [he]_p1663 requested. The less [I]_p1664 understood of this farrago, the less [I]_p1665 was in a position to judge of [its]_p1666 importance and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. [I]_p1667 rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to [Jekyll]_n411 's house. The butler was awaiting [my]_p1668 arrival [he]_p1669 had received by the same post as [mine]_p1670 a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while [we]_p1671 were yet speaking and [we]_p1672 moved in a body to old [Dr Denman]_n412 's surgical [theatre]_n413 , from which (as [you]_p1673 are doubtless aware) [Jekyll]_n414 's private cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock excellent the carpenter avowed [he]_p1674 would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used and the locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour's work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked and [I]_p1675 took out the drawer, had [it]_p1676 filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with [it]_p1677 to [Cavendish Square]_n415.",7,,25,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Here [I]_p1678 proceeded to examine [its]_p1679 contents. The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist so that [it]_p1680 was plain [they]_p1681 were of [Jekyll]_n416 's private manufacture: and when [I]_p1682 opened one of the wrappers [I]_p1683 found what seemed to [me]_p1684 a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which [I]_p1685 next turned [my]_p1686 attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to [me]_p1687 to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients [I]_p1688 could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many years, but [I]_p1689 observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single word:. ""double"". occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation,. ""total failure!!!"".",1,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," All this, though [it]_p1690 whetted [my]_p1691 curiosity, told [me]_p1692 little that was definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of [Jekyll]_n417 's investigations) to no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these articles in [my]_p1693 house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of [my]_p1694 flighty colleague? If [his]_p1696 messenger could go to one place, why could [he]_p1697 not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by [me]_p1698 in secret? The more [I]_p1699 reflected the more convinced [I]_p1700 grew that [I]_p1700 was dealing with a case of cerebral disease and though [I]_p1701 dismissed [my]_p1694 servants to bed, [I]_p1701 loaded an old revolver, that [I]_p1701 might be found in some posture of self-defence. Twelve o'clock had scarce rung out over [London]_n418 , ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door. [I]_p1705 went [myself]_p1706 at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico. ""Are [you]_p1707 come from Dr Jekyll?"". [I]_p1708 asked. [He]_p1709 told [me]_p1710. ""yes"". by a constrained gesture and when [I]_p1711 had bidden [him]_p1712 enter, [he]_p1713 did not obey [me]_p1714 without a searching backward glance into the darkness of the square.",2,,25,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," There was a policeman not far off, advancing with [his]_p1715 bull's eye open and at the sight, [I]_p1716 thought [my]_p1717 visitor started and made greater haste. These particulars struck me, [I]_p1718 confess, disagreeably and as [I]_p1719 followed [him]_p1721 into the bright light of the consulting room, [I]_p1719 kept [my]_p1722 hand ready on [my]_p1723 weapon. Here, at last, [I]_p1724 had a chance of clearly seeing him. [I]_p1725 had never set eyes on [him]_p1726 before, so much was certain. [He]_p1727 was small, as [I]_p1728 have said [I]_p1729 was struck besides with the shocking expression of [his]_p1730 face, with [his]_p1731 remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and, last but not least, with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by [his]_p1731 neighbourhood. This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse. At the time, [I]_p1733 set [it]_p1735 down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms  but [I]_p1734 have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred. This person (who had thus, from the first moment of [his]_p1736 entrance, struck in [me]_p1741 what [I]_p1742 can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable [his]_p1737 clothes, that is to say, although [they]_p1743 were of rich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for [him]_p1744 in every measurement, the trousers hanging on [his]_p1737 legs and rolled up to keep [them]_p1745 from the ground, the waist of the coat below [his]_p1738 haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon [his]_p1738 shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving [me]_p1746 to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced me, something seizing, surprising and revolting, this fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce [it]_p1747 so that to [my]_p1748 interest in the man's nature and character, there was added a curiosity as to [his]_p1749 origin, [his]_p1750 life, [his]_p1750 fortune and status in the world.",0,,37,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," These observations, though [they]_p1752 have taken so great a space to be set down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. [My]_p1753 visitor was, indeed, on fire with sombre excitement. ""Have [you]_p1754 got it?"". [he]_p1755 cried. ""Have [you]_p1756 got it?"". And so lively was [his]_p1757 impatience that [he]_p1759 even laid [his]_p1758 hand upon [my]_p1760 arm and sought to shake me. [I]_p1761 put [him]_p1762 back, conscious at [his]_p1763 touch of a certain [icy]_n419 pang along [my]_p1764 blood. ""Come, sir,"". said I. ""[You]_p1765 forget that [I]_p1766 have not yet the pleasure of [your]_p1767 acquaintance.",1,,16,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Be seated, if [you]_p1768 please. "". And [I]_p1769 showed [him]_p1771 an example, and sat down [myself]_p1772 in [my]_p1773 customary seat and with as fair an imitation of [my]_p1774 ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of [my]_p1774 preoccupations, and the horror [I]_p1770 had of [my]_p1775 visitor, would suffer [me]_p1777 to muster. ""[I]_p1778 beg [your]_p1779 pardon, [Dr Lanyon]_n420 ,"". [he]_p1780 replied civilly enough. ""What [you]_p1781 say is very well founded and [my]_p1782 impatience has shown [its]_p1784 heels to [my]_p1783 politeness. [I]_p1785 come here at the instance of [your]_p1787 colleague, [Dr Henry Jekyll]_n421 , on a piece of business of some moment and [I]_p1786 understood. "". [He]_p1788 paused and put [his]_p1789 hand to [his]_p1790 throat, and [I]_p1792 could see, in spite of [his]_p1790 collected manner, that [he]_p1793 was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria,. ""[I]_p1794 understood, a drawer.",2,,27,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But here [I]_p1795 took pity on [my]_p1796 visitor's suspense, and some perhaps on [my]_p1797 own growing curiosity. ""There [it]_p1798 is, sir,"". said I, pointing to the drawer, where [it]_p1799 lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet. [He]_p1800 sprang to it, and then paused, and laid [his]_p1801 hand upon [his]_p1802 heart: [I]_p1807 could hear [his]_p1802 teeth grate with the convulsive action of [his]_p1803 jaws and [his]_p1803 face was so ghastly to see that [I]_p1808 grew alarmed both for [his]_p1803 life and reason. ""Compose yourself,"". said I. [He]_p1809 turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, [he]_p1810 uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that [I]_p1811 sat petrified. And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control,. ""Have [you]_p1812 a graduated glass?"".",0,,18,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p1813 asked. [I]_p1814 rose from [my]_p1815 place with something of an effort and gave [him]_p1816 what [he]_p1817 asked. [He]_p1818 thanked [me]_p1819 with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to a watery green. [My]_p1820 visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned and looked upon [me]_p1821 with an air of scrutiny. ""And now,"". said he,. ""to settle what remains. [Will]_n422 [you]_p1822 be wise? will [you]_p1823 be guided? will [you]_p1823 suffer [me]_p1828 to take this glass in [my]_p1829 hand and to go forth from [your]_p1830 house without further parley? or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you? Think before [you]_p1824 answer, for [it]_p1831 shall be done as [you]_p1824 decide.",1,,18,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," As [you]_p1832 decide, [you]_p1833 shall be left as [you]_p1833 were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul. Or, if [you]_p1835 shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in this room, upon the instant and [your]_p1837 sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of [Satan]_n423. ""Sir,"". said I, affecting a coolness that [I]_p1838 was far from truly possessing,. ""[you]_p1840 speak enigmas, and [you]_p1841 will perhaps not wonder that [I]_p1843 hear [you]_p1841 with no very strong impression of belief. But [I]_p1844 have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before [I]_p1845 see the end. ""[It]_p1846 is well,"". replied [my]_p1847 visitor. ""[Lanyon]_n424 , [you]_p1848 remember [your]_p1849 vows: what follows is under the seal of [our]_p1850 profession. And now, [you]_p1851 who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, [you]_p1852 who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, [you]_p1852 who have derided [your]_p1854 superiors, behold!   [He]_p1855 put the glass to [his]_p1856 lips and drank at one gulp.",2,,23,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," A cry followed  [he]_p1857 reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth and as [I]_p1859 looked there came, [I]_p1860 thought, a change, [he]_p1858 seemed to swell, [his]_p1862 face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter, and the next moment, [I]_p1860 had sprung to [my]_p1863 feet and leaped back against the wall, [my]_p1864 arms raised to shield [me]_p1866 from that prodigy, [my]_p1864 mind submerged in terror. ""O God!"". [I]_p1867 screamed, and. ""O God!"". again and again for there before [my]_p1868 eyes, pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before [him]_p1870 with [his]_p1871 hands, like a man restored from death, there stood [Henry Jekyll]_n425 ! What [he]_p1872 told [me]_p1873 in the next hour, [I]_p1874 cannot bring [my]_p1869 mind to set on paper. [I]_p1875 saw what [I]_p1876 saw, [I]_p1876 heard what [I]_p1877 heard, and [my]_p1882 soul sickened at [it]_p1884 and yet now when that sight has faded from [my]_p1883 eyes, [I]_p1877 ask [myself]_p1886 if [I]_p1877 believe it, and [I]_p1878 cannot answer. [My]_p1887 life is shaken to [its]_p1888 roots sleep has left [me]_p1889 the deadliest terror sits by [me]_p1890 at all hours of the day and night and [I]_p1891 feel that [my]_p1894 days are numbered, and that [I]_p1892 must die  and yet [I]_p1892 shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, [I]_p1895 can not, even in memory, dwell on [it]_p1896 without a start of horror. [I]_p1897 will say but one thing, [Utterson]_n426 , and that (if [you]_p1898 can bring [your]_p1899 mind to credit it) will be more than enough. The creature who crept into [my]_p1900 house that night was, on [Jekyll]_n427 's own confession, known by the name of [Hyde]_n428 and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of [Carew]_n429.",5,,43,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," HASTIE [LANYON]_n430 HENRY [JEKYLL]_n431 'S [FULL]_n432 STATEMENT OF THE CASE [I]_p1901 was born in the year 18, to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among [my]_p1902 fellowmen, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future. And indeed the worst of [my]_p1903 faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as [I]_p1906 found [it]_p1907 hard to reconcile with [my]_p1904 imperious desire to carry [my]_p1904 head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public. Hence [it]_p1908 came about that [I]_p1909 concealed [my]_p1912 pleasures and that when [I]_p1910 reached years of reflection, and began to look round [me]_p1914 and take stock of [my]_p1913 progress and position in the world, [I]_p1910 stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as [I]_p1915 was guilty of but from the high views that [I]_p1916 had set before me, [I]_p1916 regarded and hid [them]_p1918 with an almost morbid sense of shame. [It]_p1919 was thus rather the exacting nature of [my]_p1920 aspirations than any particular degradation in [my]_p1921 faults, that made [me]_p1922 what [I]_p1924 was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in [me]_p1923 those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man's dual nature. In this case, [I]_p1925 was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer, [I]_p1926 was in no sense a hypocrite both sides of [me]_p1930 were in dead earnest  [I]_p1927 was no more [myself]_p1931 when [I]_p1927 laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when [I]_p1928 laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering. And [it]_p1932 chanced that the direction of [my]_p1933 scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among [my]_p1934 members. With every day, and from both sides of [my]_p1935 intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, [I]_p1936 thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery [I]_p1937 have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. [I]_p1938 say two, because the state of [my]_p1939 own knowledge does not pass beyond that point.",3,,39,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Others will follow, others will outstrip [me]_p1940 on the same lines  and [I]_p1941 hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for [my]_p1942 part, from the nature of [my]_p1943 life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only. [It]_p1944 was on the moral side, and in [my]_p1945 own person, that [I]_p1948 learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man [I]_p1949 saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of [my]_p1946 consciousness, even if [I]_p1949 could rightly be said to be either, [it]_p1953 was only because [I]_p1950 was radically both and from an early date, even before the course of [my]_p1946 scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, [I]_p1950 had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements. If each, [I]_p1954 told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable the unjust might go [his]_p1955 way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of [his]_p1956 more upright twin and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on [his]_p1956 upward path, doing the good things in which [he]_p1959 found [his]_p1957 pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. [It]_p1960 was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together, that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then were [they]_p1961 dissociated?  [I]_p1962 was so far in [my]_p1964 reflections when, as [I]_p1963 have said, a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. [I]_p1965 began to perceive more deeply than [it]_p1966 has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in which [we]_p1967 walk attired. Certain agents [I]_p1968 found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, [I]_p1969 will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of [my]_p1970 confession. First, because [I]_p1971 have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of [our]_p1972 life is bound for ever on man's shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast [it]_p1973 off, [it]_p1974 but returns upon [us]_p1975 with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure.",0,,36,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Second, because, as [my]_p1976 narrative will make, alas! too evident, [my]_p1977 discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that [I]_p1978 not only recognised [my]_p1979 natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up [my]_p1980 spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from [their]_p1982 supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to [me]_p1983 because [they]_p1984 were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements in [my]_p1980 soul. [I]_p1985 hesitated long before [I]_p1986 put this theory to the test of practice. [I]_p1987 knew well that [I]_p1988 risked death for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which [I]_p1988 looked to [it]_p1990 to change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm. [I]_p1991 had long since prepared [my]_p1995 tincture [I]_p1992 purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt which [I]_p1992 knew, from [my]_p1996 experiments, to be the last ingredient required and late one accursed night, [I]_p1993 compounded the elements, watched [them]_p1997 boil and smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off the potion. The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and [I]_p1998 came to [myself]_p1999 as if out of a great sickness. There was something strange in [my]_p2000 sensations, something indescribably new and, from [its]_p2001 very novelty, incredibly sweet. [I]_p2002 felt younger, lighter, happier in body  within [I]_p2003 was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in [my]_p2004 fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul.",0,,29,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p2005 knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to [my]_p2006 original evil and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted [me]_p2007 like wine. [I]_p2008 stretched out [my]_p2011 hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations and in the act, [I]_p2009 was suddenly aware that [I]_p2009 had lost in stature. There was no mirror, at that date, in [my]_p2012 room that which stands beside [me]_p2013 as [I]_p2014 write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations. The night however, was far gone into the morning, the morning, black as [it]_p2015 was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day, the inmates of [my]_p2016 house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber and [I]_p2019 determined, flushed as [I]_p2020 was with hope and triumph, to venture in [my]_p2017 new shape as far as to [my]_p2017 bedroom. [I]_p2021 crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, [I]_p2022 could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that [their]_p2025 unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to [them]_p2026 [I]_p2022 stole through the corridors, a stranger in [my]_p2027 own house and coming to [my]_p2028 room, [I]_p2023 saw for the first time the appearance of [Edward Hyde]_n433. [I]_p2029 must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which [I]_p2030 know, but that which [I]_p2030 suppose to be most probable. The evil side of [my]_p2032 nature, to which [I]_p2033 had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good which [I]_p2034 had just deposed. Again, in the course of [my]_p2035 life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, [it]_p2036 had been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as [I]_p2037 think, [it]_p2038 came about that [Edward Hyde]_n434 was so much smaller, slighter and younger than [Henry Jekyll]_n435. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other.",3,,34,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Evil besides (which [I]_p2039 must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when [I]_p2040 looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, [I]_p2041 was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself. [It]_p2042 seemed natural and human. In [my]_p2043 eyes [it]_p2044 bore a livelier image of the spirit, [it]_p2045 seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance [I]_p2046 had been hitherto accustomed to call mine. And in so far [I]_p2047 was doubtless right. [I]_p2048 have observed that when [I]_p2049 wore the semblance of [Edward Hyde]_n436 , none could come near to [me]_p2050 at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as [I]_p2051 take it, was because all human beings, as [we]_p2052 meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and [Edward Hyde]_n437 , alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil. [I]_p2053 lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted [it]_p2056 yet remained to be seen if [I]_p2054 had lost [my]_p2057 identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer [mine]_p2059 and hurrying back to [my]_p2058 cabinet, [I]_p2054 once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to [myself]_p2060 once more with the character, the stature and the face of [Henry Jekyll]_n438. That night [I]_p2061 had come to the fatal cross-roads.",3,,23,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Had [I]_p2062 approached [my]_p2065 discovery in a more noble spirit, had [I]_p2063 risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, [I]_p2063 had come forth an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action [it]_p2066 was neither diabolical nor divine [it]_p2067 but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of [my]_p2068 disposition and like the captives of [Philippi]_n439 , that which stood within ran forth. At that time [my]_p2069 virtue slumbered [my]_p2070 evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion and the thing that was projected was [Edward Hyde]_n440. Hence, although [I]_p2071 had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old [Henry Jekyll]_n441 , that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement [I]_p2072 had already learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse. Even at that time, [I]_p2073 had not conquered [my]_p2074 aversions to the dryness of a life of study. [I]_p2075 would still be merrily disposed at times and as [my]_p2077 pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and [I]_p2076 was not only well known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of [my]_p2078 life was daily growing more unwelcome. [It]_p2079 was on this side that [my]_p2080 new power tempted [me]_p2081 until [I]_p2082 fell in slavery. [I]_p2083 had but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to assume, like a thick cloak, that of [Edward Hyde]_n442. [I]_p2084 smiled at the notion  [it]_p2086 seemed to [me]_p2087 at the time to be humourous and [I]_p2085 made [my]_p2088 preparations with the most studious care.",4,,27,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p2089 took and furnished that house in [Soho]_n443 , to which [Hyde]_n444 was tracked by the police and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom [I]_p2090 knew well to be silent and unscrupulous. On the other side, [I]_p2091 announced to [my]_p2094 servants that a [Mr Hyde]_n445 (whom [I]_p2092 described) was to have full liberty and power about [my]_p2095 house in the square and to parry mishaps, [I]_p2092 even called and made [myself]_p2097 a familiar object, in [my]_p2095 second character. [I]_p2098 next drew up that will to which [you]_p2100 so much objected so that if anything befell [me]_p2101 in the person of Dr Jekyll, [I]_p2099 could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as [I]_p2102 supposed, on every side, [I]_p2103 began to profit by the strange immunities of [my]_p2104 position. Men have before hired bravos to transact [their]_p2105 crimes, while [their]_p2106 own person and reputation sat under shelter. [I]_p2107 was the first that ever did so for [his]_p2108 pleasures. [I]_p2109 was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty. But for me, in [my]_p2110 impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think of it, [I]_p2111 did not even exist! Let [me]_p2113 but escape into [my]_p2115 laboratory door, give [me]_p2114 but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that [I]_p2112 had always standing ready and whatever [he]_p2116 had done, [Edward Hyde]_n446 would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror and there in [his]_p2117 stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in [his]_p2118 study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be [Henry Jekyll]_n447. The pleasures which [I]_p2119 made haste to seek in [my]_p2122 disguise were, as [I]_p2120 have said, undignified [I]_p2120 would scarce use a harder term.",5,,34,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But in the hands of [Edward Hyde]_n448 , [they]_p2123 soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When [I]_p2124 would come back from these excursions, [I]_p2125 was often plunged into a kind of wonder at [my]_p2126 vicarious depravity. This familiar that [I]_p2127 called out of [my]_p2128 own soul, and sent forth alone to do [his]_p2129 good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous [his]_p2130 every act and thought centered on self drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another relentless like a man of stone. [Henry Jekyll]_n449 stood at times aghast before the acts of [Edward Hyde]_n450 but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. [It]_p2131 was [Hyde]_n451 , after all, and [Hyde]_n452 alone, that was guilty. [Jekyll]_n453 was no worse [he]_p2132 woke again to [his]_p2134 good qualities seemingly unimpaired [he]_p2133 would even make haste, where [it]_p2135 was possible, to undo the evil done by [Hyde]_n454. And thus [his]_p2136 conscience slumbered. Into the details of the infamy at which [I]_p2137 thus connived (for even now [I]_p2138 can scarce grant that [I]_p2138 committed it) [I]_p2139 have no design of entering [I]_p2139 mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which [my]_p2142 chastisement approached. [I]_p2143 met with one accident which, as [it]_p2145 brought on no consequence, [I]_p2144 shall no more than mention. An act of cruelty to a child aroused against [me]_p2146 the anger of a passer-by, whom [I]_p2147 recognised the other day in the person of [your]_p2149 kinsman the doctor and the child's family joined [him]_p2150 there were moments when [I]_p2148 feared for [my]_p2151 life and at last, in order to pacify [their]_p2152 too just resentment, [Edward Hyde]_n455 had to bring [them]_p2153 to the door, and pay [them]_p2154 in a cheque drawn in the name of [Henry Jekyll]_n456.",9,,32,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of [Edward Hyde]_n457 [himself]_p2155 and when, by sloping [my]_p2156 own hand backward, [I]_p2158 had supplied [my]_p2157 double with a signature, [I]_p2159 thought [I]_p2159 sat beyond the reach of fate. Some two months before the murder of [Sir Danvers]_n458 , [I]_p2161 had been out for one of [my]_p2162 adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. [It]_p2163 was in vain [I]_p2164 looked about [me]_p2172 in vain [I]_p2165 saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of [my]_p2173 room in the square in vain that [I]_p2165 recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame something still kept insisting that [I]_p2166 was not where [I]_p2166 was, that [I]_p2166 had not wakened where [I]_p2167 seemed to be, but in the little room in [Soho]_n459 where [I]_p2167 was accustomed to sleep in the body of [Edward Hyde]_n460. [I]_p2174 smiled to myself, and in [my]_p2176 psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as [I]_p2175 did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. [I]_p2177 was still so engaged when, in one of [my]_p2178 more wakeful moments, [my]_p2179 eyes fell upon [my]_p2179 hand. Now the hand of [Henry Jekyll]_n461 (as [you]_p2181 have often remarked) was professional in shape and size: [it]_p2182 was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which [I]_p2183 now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-[London]_n462 morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corder, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. [It]_p2184 was the hand of [Edward Hyde]_n463. [I]_p2185 must have stared upon [it]_p2188 for near half a minute, sunk as [I]_p2186 was in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in [my]_p2189 breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals and bounding from [my]_p2190 bed [I]_p2186 rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met [my]_p2191 eyes, [my]_p2192 blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and [icy]_n464.",8,,38,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Yes, [I]_p2193 had gone to bed [Henry Jekyll]_n465 , [I]_p2194 had awakened [Edward Hyde]_n466. How was this to be explained? [I]_p2195 asked [myself]_p2197 and then, with another bound of terror, how was [it]_p2198 to be remedied? [It]_p2199 was well on in the morning the servants were up all [my]_p2200 drugs were in the cabinet, a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical [theatre]_n467 , from where [I]_p2196 was then standing horror-struck. [It]_p2201 might indeed be possible to cover [my]_p2202 face but of what use was that, when [I]_p2206 was unable to conceal the alteration in [my]_p2203 stature? And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, [it]_p2207 came back upon [my]_p2203 mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of [my]_p2204 second self. [I]_p2208 had soon dressed, as well as [I]_p2209 was able, in clothes of [my]_p2210 own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array and ten minutes later, Dr Jekyll had returned to [his]_p2211 own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting. Small indeed was [my]_p2212 appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal of [my]_p2213 previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of [my]_p2214 judgment and [I]_p2216 began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of [my]_p2214 double existence. That part of [me]_p2217 which [I]_p2219 had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished [it]_p2223 had seemed to [me]_p2218 of late as though the body of [Edward Hyde]_n468 had grown in stature, as though (when [I]_p2220 wore that form) [I]_p2220 were conscious of a more generous tide of blood and [I]_p2221 began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged, the balance of [my]_p2224 nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of [Edward Hyde]_n469 become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally displayed. Once, very early in [my]_p2225 career, [it]_p2227 had totally failed [me]_p2228  since then [I]_p2229 had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on [my]_p2226 contentment. Now, however, and in the light of that morning's accident, [I]_p2230 was led to remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of [Jekyll]_n470 , [it]_p2231 had of late gradually but decidedly transferred [itself]_p2232 to the other side.",6,,40,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," All things therefore seemed to point to this that [I]_p2233 was slowly losing hold of [my]_p2234 original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with [my]_p2235 second and worse. Between these two, [I]_p2236 now felt [I]_p2237 had to choose. [My]_p2238 two natures had memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them. [Jekyll]_n471 (who was composite) now with the most sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of [Hyde]_n472 but [Hyde]_n473 was indifferent to [Jekyll]_n474 , or but remembered [him]_p2239 as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which [he]_p2240 conceals [himself]_p2241 from pursuit. [Jekyll]_n475 had more than a father's interest [Hyde]_n476 had more than a son's indifference. To cast in [my]_p2242 lot with [Jekyll]_n477 , was to die to those appetites which [I]_p2243 had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast [it]_p2244 in with [Hyde]_n478 , was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal but there was still another consideration in the scales for while [Jekyll]_n479 would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, [Hyde]_n480 would be not even conscious of all that [he]_p2245 had lost. Strange as [my]_p2246 circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man  much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner and [it]_p2248 fell out with me, as [it]_p2249 falls with so vast a majority of [my]_p2247 fellows, that [I]_p2251 chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it. Yes, [I]_p2252 preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that [I]_p2253 had enjoyed in the disguise of [Hyde]_n481.",11,,20,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p2254 made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for [I]_p2255 neither gave up the house in [Soho]_n482 , nor destroyed the clothes of [Edward Hyde]_n483 , which still lay ready in [my]_p2256 cabinet. For two months, however, [I]_p2257 was true to [my]_p2260 determination for two months, [I]_p2258 led a life of such severity as [I]_p2258 had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate the freshness of [my]_p2261 alarm the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course [I]_p2262 began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of [Hyde]_n484 struggling after freedom and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, [I]_p2263 once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught. [I]_p2264 do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with [himself]_p2267 upon [his]_p2268 vice, [he]_p2270 is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that [he]_p2271 runs through [his]_p2269 brutish, physical insensibility neither had I, long as [I]_p2265 had considered [my]_p2272 position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of [Edward Hyde]_n485. Yet [it]_p2273 was by these that [I]_p2274 was punished. [My]_p2275 devil had been long caged, [he]_p2276 came out roaring. [I]_p2277 was conscious, even when [I]_p2278 took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill. [It]_p2279 must have been this, [I]_p2280 suppose, that stirred in [my]_p2284 soul that tempest of impatience with which [I]_p2281 listened to the civilities of [my]_p2285 unhappy victim [I]_p2281 declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation and that [I]_p2282 struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But [I]_p2286 had voluntarily stripped [myself]_p2287 of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of [us]_p2288 continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations and in [my]_p2289 case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall. Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in [me]_p2290 and raged.",4,,36,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," With a transport of glee, [I]_p2291 mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow  and [it]_p2293 was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that [I]_p2292 was suddenly, in the top fit of [my]_p2294 delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed [I]_p2295 saw [my]_p2296 life to be forfeit and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, [my]_p2297 lust of evil gratified and stimulated, [my]_p2297 love of life screwed to the topmost peg. [I]_p2299 ran to the house in [Soho]_n486 , and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed [my]_p2301 papers thence [I]_p2300 set out through the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on [my]_p2302 crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in [my]_p2302 wake for the steps of the avenger. [Hyde]_n487 had a song upon [his]_p2304 lips as [he]_p2305 compounded the draught, and as [he]_p2306 drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before [Henry Jekyll]_n488 , with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon [his]_p2307 knees and lifted [his]_p2308 clasped hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. [I]_p2309 saw [my]_p2312 life as a whole: [I]_p2310 followed [it]_p2315 up from the days of childhood, when [I]_p2310 had walked with [my]_p2313 father's hand, and through the self-denying toils of [my]_p2313 professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. [I]_p2316 could have screamed aloud [I]_p2317 sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which [my]_p2318 memory swarmed against [me]_p2321 and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of [my]_p2319 iniquity stared into [my]_p2319 soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, [it]_p2322 was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of [my]_p2323 conduct was solved.",3,,33,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [Hyde]_n489 was thenceforth impossible whether [I]_p2324 would or not, [I]_p2325 was now confined to the better part of [my]_p2330 existence and O, how [I]_p2325 rejoiced to think of it! with what willing humility [I]_p2326 embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation [I]_p2326 locked the door by which [I]_p2326 had so often gone and come, and ground the key under [my]_p2331 heel! The next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked, that the guilt of [Hyde]_n490 was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in public estimation. [It]_p2332 was not only a crime, [it]_p2333 had been a tragic folly. [I]_p2334 think [I]_p2335 was glad to know [it]_p2338 [I]_p2335 think [I]_p2336 was glad to have [my]_p2339 better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold. [Jekyll]_n491 was now [my]_p2340 city of refuge let but [Hyde]_n492 peep out an instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him. [I]_p2341 resolved in [my]_p2343 future conduct to redeem the past and [I]_p2342 can say with honesty that [my]_p2344 resolve was fruitful of some good. [You]_p2345 know [yourself]_p2346 how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, [I]_p2347 laboured to relieve suffering [you]_p2348 know that much was done for others, and that the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can [I]_p2349 truly say that [I]_p2350 wearied of this beneficent and innocent life [I]_p2350 think instead that [I]_p2351 daily enjoyed [it]_p2354 more completely but [I]_p2351 was still cursed with [my]_p2355 duality of purpose and as the first edge of [my]_p2356 penitence wore off, the lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl for licence. Not that [I]_p2357 dreamed of resuscitating [Hyde]_n493 the bare idea of that would startle [me]_p2360 to frenzy: no, [it]_p2361 was in [my]_p2363 own person that [I]_p2358 was once more tempted to trifle with [my]_p2364 conscience and [it]_p2362 was as an ordinary secret sinner that [I]_p2358 at last fell before the assaults of temptation. There comes an end to all things the most capacious measure is filled at last and this brief condescension to [my]_p2365 evil finally destroyed the balance of [my]_p2366 soul. And yet [I]_p2367 was not alarmed the fall seemed natural, like a return to the old days before [I]_p2368 had made [my]_p2369 discovery.",5,,46,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p2370 was a fine, clear, [January]_n494 day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead and the [Regent]_n495 's [Park]_n496 was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. [I]_p2371 sat in the sun on a bench the animal within [me]_p2372 licking the chops of memory the spiritual side a little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin. After all, [I]_p2373 reflected, [I]_p2374 was like [my]_p2376 neighbours and then [I]_p2374 smiled, comparing [myself]_p2378 with other men, comparing [my]_p2377 active good-will with the lazy cruelty of [their]_p2379 neglect. And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left [me]_p2380 faint and then as in [its]_p2381 turn faintness subsided, [I]_p2382 began to be aware of a change in the temper of [my]_p2383 thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation. [I]_p2384 looked down [my]_p2385 clothes hung formlessly on [my]_p2386 shrunken limbs the hand that lay on [my]_p2386 knee was corded and hairy. [I]_p2388 was once more [Edward Hyde]_n497. A moment before [I]_p2389 had been safe of all men's respect, wealthy, beloved, the cloth laying for [me]_p2391 in the dining-room at home and now [I]_p2390 was the common quarry of mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows. [My]_p2392 reason wavered, but [it]_p2393 did not fail [me]_p2394 utterly. [I]_p2395 have more than once observed that in [my]_p2396 second character, [my]_p2397 faculties seemed sharpened to a point and [my]_p2397 spirits more tensely elastic thus [it]_p2399 came about that, where [Jekyll]_n498 perhaps might have succumbed, [Hyde]_n499 rose to the importance of the moment.",6,,30,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [My]_p2400 drugs were in one of the presses of [my]_p2401 cabinet how was [I]_p2404 to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing [my]_p2402 temples in [my]_p2402 hands) [I]_p2405 set [myself]_p2406 to solve. The laboratory door [I]_p2407 had closed. If [I]_p2408 sought to enter by the house, [my]_p2409 own servants would consign [me]_p2410 to the gallows. [I]_p2411 saw [I]_p2412 must employ another hand, and thought of [Lanyon]_n500. How was [he]_p2413 to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing that [I]_p2414 escaped capture in the streets, how was [I]_p2415 to make [my]_p2421 way into [his]_p2424 presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of [his]_p2425 colleague, Dr Jekyll? Then [I]_p2415 remembered that of [my]_p2422 original character, one part remained to me: [I]_p2416 could write [my]_p2422 own hand and once [I]_p2416 had conceived that kindling spark, the way that [I]_p2416 must follow became lighted up from end to end. Thereupon, [I]_p2426 arranged [my]_p2429 clothes as best [I]_p2427 could, and summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in [Portland Street]_n501 , the name of which [I]_p2427 chanced to remember. At [my]_p2430 appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal [his]_p2431 mirth. [I]_p2432 gnashed [my]_p2434 teeth upon [him]_p2435 with a gust of devilish fury and the smile withered from [his]_p2438 face, happily for him, yet more happily for myself, for in another instant [I]_p2433 had certainly dragged [him]_p2436 from [his]_p2439 perch. At the inn, as [I]_p2440 entered, [I]_p2441 looked about [me]_p2442 with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble not a look did [they]_p2445 exchange in [my]_p2446 presence but obsequiously took [my]_p2447 orders, led [me]_p2443 to a private room, and brought [me]_p2443 wherewithal to write. [Hyde]_n502 in danger of [his]_p2448 life was a creature new to [me]_p2449 shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain.",3,,48,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Yet the creature was astute mastered [his]_p2450 fury with a great effort of the will composed [his]_p2451 two important letters, one to [Lanyon]_n503 and one to [Poole]_n504 and that [he]_p2452 might receive actual evidence of [their]_p2453 being posted, sent [them]_p2454 out with directions that [they]_p2455 should be registered. Thenceforward, [he]_p2456 sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing [his]_p2459 nails there [he]_p2457 dined, sitting alone with [his]_p2460 fears, the waiter visibly quailing before [his]_p2460 eye and thence, when the night was fully come, [he]_p2457 set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, [I]_p2462 say, [I]_p2463 cannot say, I. That child of [Hell]_n505 had nothing human nothing lived in [him]_p2465 but fear and hatred. And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, [he]_p2466 discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in [his]_p2467 misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within [him]_p2468 like a tempest. [He]_p2469 walked fast, hunted by [his]_p2470 fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided [him]_p2471 from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, [I]_p2472 think, a box of lights. [He]_p2473 smote [her]_p2474 in the face, and [she]_p2475 fled. When [I]_p2476 came to [myself]_p2479 at [Lanyon]_n506 's, the horror of [my]_p2480 old friend perhaps affected [me]_p2481 somewhat: [I]_p2477 do not know [it]_p2482 was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which [I]_p2477 looked back upon these hours. A change had come over me.",4,,32,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p2483 was no longer the fear of the gallows, [it]_p2484 was the horror of being [Hyde]_n507 that racked me. [I]_p2485 received [Lanyon]_n508 's condemnation partly in a dream [it]_p2487 was partly in a dream that [I]_p2486 came home to [my]_p2488 own house and got into bed. [I]_p2489 slept after the prostration of the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung [me]_p2490 could avail to break. [I]_p2491 awoke in the morning shaken, weakened, but refreshed. [I]_p2492 still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me, and [I]_p2493 had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before but [I]_p2493 was once more at home, in [my]_p2495 own house and close to [my]_p2496 drugs and gratitude for [my]_p2496 escape shone so strong in [my]_p2497 soul that [it]_p2499 almost rivalled the brightness of hope. [I]_p2500 was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when [I]_p2501 was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change and [I]_p2501 had but the time to gain the shelter of [my]_p2504 cabinet, before [I]_p2502 was once again raging and freezing with the passions of [Hyde]_n509. [It]_p2505 took on this occasion a double dose to recall [me]_p2506 to [myself]_p2507 and alas! six hours after, as [I]_p2508 sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered. In short, from that day forth [it]_p2509 seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that [I]_p2510 was able to wear the countenance of [Jekyll]_n510. At all hours of the day and night, [I]_p2511 would be taken with the premonitory shudder above all, if [I]_p2512 slept, or even dozed for a moment in [my]_p2514 chair, [it]_p2515 was always as [Hyde]_n511 that [I]_p2512 awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which [I]_p2516 now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what [I]_p2517 had thought possible to man, [I]_p2517 became, in [my]_p2519 own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of [my]_p2520 other self.",5,,38,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But when [I]_p2521 slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, [I]_p2522 would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life. The powers of [Hyde]_n512 seemed to have grown with the sickliness of [Jekyll]_n513. And certainly the hate that now divided [them]_p2523 was equal on each side. With [Jekyll]_n514 , [it]_p2524 was a thing of vital instinct. [He]_p2525 had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with [him]_p2526 some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with [him]_p2527 to death: and beyond these links of community, which in [themselves]_p2528 made the most poignant part of [his]_p2529 distress, [he]_p2531 thought of [Hyde]_n515 , for all [his]_p2530 energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing  that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to [him]_p2532 closer than a wife, closer than an eye  lay caged in [his]_p2535 flesh, where [he]_p2536 heard [it]_p2537 mutter and felt [it]_p2538 struggle to be born and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed [him]_p2533 out of life. The hatred of [Hyde]_n516 for [Jekyll]_n517 was of a different order. [His]_p2539 terror of the gallows drove [him]_p2540 continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to [his]_p2541 subordinate station of a part instead of a person but [he]_p2542 loathed the necessity, [he]_p2543 loathed the despondency into which [Jekyll]_n518 was now fallen, and [he]_p2543 resented the dislike with which [he]_p2544 was [himself]_p2546 regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks that [he]_p2547 would play me, scrawling in [my]_p2551 own hand blasphemies on the pages of [my]_p2552 books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of [my]_p2552 father and indeed, had [it]_p2554 not been for [his]_p2555 fear of death, [he]_p2548 would long ago have ruined [himself]_p2556 in order to involve [me]_p2549 in the ruin.",7,,34,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But [his]_p2557 love of [me]_p2558 is wonderful [I]_p2559 go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when [I]_p2560 recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when [I]_p2560 know how [he]_p2567 fears [my]_p2568 power to cut [him]_p2564 off by suicide, [I]_p2561 find [it]_p2570 in [my]_p2569 heart to pity him. [It]_p2571 is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this description no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice  and yet even to these, habit brought, no, not alleviation, but a certain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair and [my]_p2574 punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has finally severed [me]_p2572 from [my]_p2575 own face and nature. [My]_p2576 provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment, began to run low. [I]_p2577 sent out for a fresh supply and mixed the draught the ebullition followed, and the first change of colour, not the second [I]_p2578 drank [it]_p2579 and [it]_p2580 was without efficiency. [You]_p2581 will learn from [Poole]_n519 how [I]_p2582 have had [London]_n520 ransacked [it]_p2584 was in vain and [I]_p2583 am now persuaded that [my]_p2586 first supply was impure, and that [it]_p2585 was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught. About a week has passed, and [I]_p2587 am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last time, short of a miracle, that [Henry Jekyll]_n521 can think [his]_p2588 own thoughts or see [his]_p2589 own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must [I]_p2590 delay too long to bring [my]_p2591 writing to an end for if [my]_p2592 narrative has hitherto escaped destruction, [it]_p2593 has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take [me]_p2594 in the act of writing it, [Hyde]_n522 will tear [it]_p2595 in pieces but if some time shall have elapsed after [I]_p2599 have laid [it]_p2596 by, [his]_p2600 wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save [it]_p2596 once again from the action of [his]_p2601 ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing on [us]_p2602 both has already changed and crushed him.",4,,41,

[Will]_n523 [Hyde]_n524 die upon the scaffold? or will [he]_p2608 find courage to release [himself]_p2609 at the last moment? God knows [I]_p2610 am careless this is [my]_p2611 true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself. Here then, as [I]_p2612 lay down the pen and proceed to seal up [my]_p2614 confession, [I]_p2613 bring the life of that unhappy [Henry Jekyll]_n525 to an end.",3,,11,
