stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde,"STORY OF THE [DOOR]_n0 [Mr Utterson]_n1 the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse backward in sentiment lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to [his]_p0 taste, something eminently human beaconed from [his]_p1 eye something indeed which never found [its]_p4 way into [his]_p1 talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of [his]_p2 life. [He]_p5 was austere with [himself]_p6 drank gin when [he]_p7 was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages and though [he]_p8 enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But [he]_p9 had an approved tolerance for others sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in [their]_p10 misdeeds and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. ""I incline to Cain's heresy,  [he]_p11 used to say quaintly:. ""I let [my]_p12 brother go to the devil in [his]_p13 own way. "". In this character, [it]_p14 was frequently [his]_p15 fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as [they]_p16 came about [his]_p17 chambers, [he]_p19 never marked a shade of change in [his]_p18 demeanour. No doubt the feat was easy to [Mr Utterson]_n2 for [he]_p20 was undemonstrative at the best, and even [his]_p21 friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature.",3,,22,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p22 is the mark of a modest man to accept [his]_p23 friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity and that was the lawyer's way. [His]_p24 friends were those of [his]_p25 own blood or those whom [he]_p27 had known the longest [his]_p26 affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, [they]_p28 implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united [him]_p29 to [Mr Richard Enfield]_n3 , [his]_p30 distant kinsman, the well-known man about town. [It]_p31 was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject [they]_p32 could find in common. [It]_p33 was reported by those who encountered [them]_p34 in [their]_p35 [Sunday]_n4 walks, that [they]_p36 said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted [them]_p37 the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that [they]_p39 might enjoy [them]_p38 uninterrupted. [It]_p40 chanced on one of these rambles that [their]_p41 way led [them]_p42 down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but [it]_p43 drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, [it]_p44 seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of [their]_p45 grains in coquetry  so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on [Sunday]_n5 , when [it]_p46 veiled [its]_p47 more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to [its]_p48 dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest and with [its]_p48 freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.",3,,28,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward [its]_p50 gable on the street. [It]_p51 was two storeys high showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels children kept shop upon the steps the schoolboy had tried [his]_p52 knife on the mouldings and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair [their]_p53 ravages. [Mr Enfield]_n6 and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street but when [they]_p54 came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up [his]_p55 cane and pointed. ""Did [you]_p56 ever remark that door?"". [he]_p57 asked and when [his]_p58 companion had replied in the affirmative. ""It is connected in [my]_p59 mind,"". added he,. ""with a very odd story.",1,,10,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Indeed?"". said [Mr Utterson]_n7 , with a slight change of voice,. ""and what was that?. ""Well, [it]_p60 was this way,"". returned [Mr Enfield]_n8 :. ""I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o'clock of a black winter morning, and [my]_p61 way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. [Street]_n9 after street and all the folks asleep, street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church, till at last [I]_p62 got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, [I]_p63 saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as [she]_p64 was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner and then came the horrible part of the thing for the man trampled calmly over the child's body and left [her]_p65 screaming on the ground. [It]_p66 sounds nothing to hear, but [it]_p67 was hellish to see.",3,,8,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p68 wasn't like a man [it]_p69 was like some damned Juggernaut. [I]_p70 gave a few halloa, took to [my]_p71 heels, collared [my]_p72 gentleman, and brought [him]_p73 back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. [He]_p74 was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave [me]_p75 one look, so ugly that [it]_p77 brought out the sweat on [me]_p76 like running. The people who had turned out were the girl's own family and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom [she]_p78 had been sent put in [his]_p79 appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones and there [you]_p80 might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. [I]_p81 had taken a loathing to [my]_p82 gentleman at first sight. So had the child's family, which was only natural. But the doctor's case was what struck me. [He]_p83 was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe.",0,,16,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Well, sir, [he]_p84 was like the rest of [us]_p86 every time [he]_p85 looked at [my]_p87 prisoner, [I]_p88 saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with desire to kill him. [I]_p89 knew what was in [his]_p90 mind, just as [he]_p91 knew what was in mine and killing being out of the question, [we]_p92 did the next best. [We]_p93 told the man [we]_p94 could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make [his]_p95 name stink from one end of London to the other. If [he]_p96 had any friends or any credit, [we]_p98 undertook that [he]_p97 should lose them. And all the time, as [we]_p99 were pitching [it]_p102 in red hot, [we]_p100 were keeping the women off [him]_p103 as best [we]_p100 could for [they]_p104 were as wild as harpies. [I]_p105 never saw a circle of such hateful faces and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering coolness, frightened too, [I]_p106 could see that, but carrying [it]_p107 off, sir, really like Satan. `If [you]_p108 choose to make capital out of this accident,' said he, `I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,' says he. `Name [your]_p109 figure. ' Well, [we]_p110 screwed [him]_p111 up to a hundred pounds for the child's family [he]_p112 would have clearly liked to stick out but there was something about the lot of [us]_p114 that meant mischief, and at last [he]_p113 struck.",0,,31,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," The next thing was to get the money and where do [you]_p115 think [he]_p116 carried [us]_p117 but to that place with the door?, whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts's, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that [I]_p118 can't mention, though it's one of the points of [my]_p121 story, but [it]_p119 was a name at least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff but the signature was good for more than that if [it]_p122 was only genuine. [I]_p123 took the liberty of pointing out to [my]_p124 gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man's cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But [he]_p125 was quite easy and sneering. `Set [your]_p126 mind at rest,' says he, `I will stay with [you]_p127 till the banks open and cash the cheque myself. ' So [we]_p128 all set off, the doctor, and the child's father, and [our]_p130 friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in [my]_p131 chambers and next day, when [we]_p129 had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. [I]_p132 gave in the cheque myself, and said [I]_p133 had every reason to believe [it]_p134 was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine. ""Tut-tut,"".",0,,19,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said [Mr Utterson]_n10. ""I see [you]_p137 feel as [I]_p135 do,"". said [Mr Enfield]_n11. ""Yes, it's a bad story. For [my]_p138 man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable man and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes [it]_p139 worse) one of [your]_p140 fellows who do what [they]_p141 call good. [Black]_n12 mail [I]_p142 suppose an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of [his]_p143 youth. [Black Mail House]_n13 is what [I]_p144 call the place with the door, in consequence. Though even that, [you]_p145 know, is far from explaining all,"". [he]_p146 added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing. From this [he]_p147 was recalled by [Mr Utterson]_n14 asking rather suddenly:.",5,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""And [you]_p148 don't know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?. ""A likely place, isn't it?"". returned [Mr Enfield]_n15. ""But [I]_p149 happen to have noticed [his]_p150 address [he]_p151 lives in some square or other. ""And [you]_p152 never asked about the, place with the door?"". said [Mr Utterson]_n16. ""No, sir: [I]_p153 had a delicacy,"". was the reply. ""I feel very strongly about putting questions [it]_p154 partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. [You]_p155 start a question, and it's like starting a stone.",2,,8,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [You]_p156 sit quietly on the top of a hill and away the stone goes, starting others  and presently some bland old bird (the last [you]_p157 would have thought of) is knocked on the head in [his]_p158 own back garden and the family have to change [their]_p159 name. No sir, [I]_p160 make [it]_p162 a rule of mine: the more [it]_p163 looks like [Queer Street]_n17 , the less [I]_p161 ask. ""A very good rule, too,"". said the lawyer. ""But [I]_p164 have studied the place for myself,"". continued [Mr Enfield]_n18. ""It seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of [my]_p165 adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor none below the windows are always shut but they're clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking so somebody must live there.",2,,10,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," And yet it's not so sure for the buildings are so packed together about the court, that it's hard to say where one ends and another begins. The pair walked on again for a while in silence and then. ""[Enfield]_n19 , said [Mr Utterson]_n20 ,. ""that's a good rule of yours. ""Yes, [I]_p166 think [it]_p167 is,"". returned [Enfield]_n21. ""But for all that,"". continued the lawyer,. ""there's one point [I]_p168 want to ask: [I]_p169 want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child. ""Well,"".",3,,4,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said [Mr Enfield]_n22 ,. ""I can't see what harm [it]_p170 would do. [It]_p171 was a man of the name of [Hyde]_n23. ""Hm,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n24. ""What sort of a man is [he]_p172 to see?. ""He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with [his]_p173 appearance something displeasing, something down-right detestable. [I]_p174 never saw a man [I]_p175 so disliked, and yet [I]_p175 scarce know why. [He]_p177 must be deformed somewhere [he]_p178 gives a strong feeling of deformity, although [I]_p179 couldn't specify the point.",3,,10,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," He's an extraordinary looking man, and yet [I]_p180 really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir [I]_p181 can make no hand of [it]_p183 [I]_p182 can't describe him. And it's not want of memory for [I]_p184 declare [I]_p185 can see [him]_p186 this moment. [Mr Utterson]_n25 again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration. ""You are sure [he]_p187 used a key?"". [he]_p188 inquired at last. ""My dear sir. "". began [Enfield]_n26 , surprised out of himself. ""Yes, [I]_p189 know,"".",2,,10,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said [Utterson]_n27. ""I know [it]_p190 must seem strange. The fact is, if [I]_p191 do not ask [you]_p193 the name of the other party, [it]_p194 is because [I]_p192 know [it]_p195 already. [You]_p196 see, [Richard]_n28 , [your]_p197 tale has gone home. If [you]_p198 have been inexact in any point [you]_p199 had better correct it. ""I think [you]_p200 might have warned me,"". returned the other with a touch of sullenness. ""But [I]_p201 have been pedantically exact, as [you]_p202 call it. The fellow had a key and what's more, [he]_p203 has [it]_p204 still. [I]_p205 saw [him]_p206 use [it]_p207 not a week ago.",2,,18,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [Mr Utterson]_n29 sighed deeply but said never a word and the young man presently resumed. ""Here is another lesson to say nothing,"". said he. ""I am ashamed of [my]_p208 long tongue. Let [us]_p209 make a bargain never to refer to this again. ""With all [my]_p210 heart,"". said the lawyer. ""I shake hands on that, [Richard]_n30. SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE That evening [Mr Utterson]_n31 came home to [his]_p211 bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish.",3,,4,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p212 was [his]_p213 custom of a [Sunday]_n32 , when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on [his]_p214 reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when [he]_p215 would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, [he]_p216 took up a candle and went into [his]_p217 business room. There [he]_p218 opened [his]_p219 safe, took from the most private part of [it]_p220 a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr Jekyll's Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study [its]_p221 contents. The will was holograph, for [Mr Utterson]_n33 though [he]_p222 took charge of [it]_p223 now that [it]_p224 was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of [it]_p224 [it]_p225 provided not only that, in case of the decease of [Henry Jekyll]_n34 , M. D. , D. C. L. , L. L.",3,,15,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," D. , F. R. S. , etc. , all [his]_p227 possessions were to pass into the hands of [his]_p228. ""friend and benefactor [Edward Hyde]_n35 ,"". but that in case of Dr Jekyll's. ""disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,"". the said [Edward Hyde]_n36 should step into the said [Henry Jekyll]_n37 's shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor's household.",3,,2,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," This document had long been the lawyer's eyesore. [It]_p229 offended [him]_p230 both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto [it]_p231 was [his]_p233 ignorance of [Mr Hyde]_n38 that had swelled [his]_p234 indignation now, by a sudden turn, [it]_p232 was [his]_p234 knowledge. [It]_p236 was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which [he]_p237 could learn no more. [It]_p238 was worse when [it]_p239 began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled [his]_p240 eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend. ""I thought [it]_p241 was madness,"". [he]_p242 said, as [he]_p243 replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe,. ""and now [I]_p244 begin to fear [it]_p245 is disgrace. With that [he]_p246 blew out [his]_p247 candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in the direction of [Cavendish Square]_n39 , that citadel of medicine, where [his]_p248 friend, the great [Dr Lanyon]_n40 , had [his]_p248 house and received [his]_p249 crowding patients. ""If anyone knows, [it]_p251 will be [Lanyon]_n41 ,"".",4,,23,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p252 had thought. The solemn butler knew and welcomed [him]_p253 [he]_p254 was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where [Dr Lanyon]_n42 sat alone over [his]_p255 wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner. At sight of [Mr Utterson]_n43 , [he]_p256 sprang up from [his]_p257 chair and welcomed [him]_p258 with both hands. The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye but [it]_p259 reposed on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both thorough respectors of [themselves]_p260 and of each other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each other's company. After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied [his]_p261 mind. ""I suppose, [Lanyon]_n44 ,"". said he,. ""you and [I]_p262 must be the two oldest friends that [Henry Jekyll]_n45 has?.",4,,11,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""I wish the friends were younger,"". chuckled [Dr Lanyon]_n46. ""But [I]_p263 suppose [we]_p264 are. And what of that? [I]_p265 see little of [him]_p266 now. ""Indeed?"". said [Utterson]_n47. ""I thought [you]_p267 had a bond of common interest. ""We had,"". was the reply. ""But [it]_p268 is more than ten years since [Henry Jekyll]_n48 became too fanciful for me.",3,,6,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [He]_p269 began to go wrong, wrong in mind  and though of course [I]_p270 continue to take an interest in [him]_p273 for old sake's sake, as [they]_p274 say, [I]_p271 see and [I]_p271 have seen devilish little of the man. Such unscientific balderdash,"". added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple,. ""would have estranged Damon and Pythias. This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to [Mr Utterson]_n49. ""They have only differed on some point of science,"". [he]_p275 thought  and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), [he]_p276 even added:. ""It is nothing worse than that!"". [He]_p277 gave [his]_p278 friend a few seconds to recover [his]_p279 composure, and then approached the question [he]_p280 had come to put. ""Did [you]_p281 ever come across a protege of his, one [Hyde]_n50 ?"".",2,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p282 asked. ""[Hyde]_n51 ?"". repeated [Lanyon]_n52. ""No. Never heard of him. Since [my]_p283 time. That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with [him]_p284 to the great, dark bed on which [he]_p285 tossed to and fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. [It]_p286 was a night of little ease to [his]_p287 toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and beseiged by questions. Six o'clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to [Mr Utterson]_n53 's dwelling, and still [he]_p288 was digging at the problem. Hitherto [it]_p289 had touched [him]_p290 on the intellectual side alone but now [his]_p291 imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved and as [he]_p293 lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, [Mr Enfield]_n54 's tale went by before [his]_p292 mind in a scroll of lighted pictures.",4,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [He]_p294 would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city then of the figure of a man walking swiftly then of a child running from the doctor's and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of [her]_p295 screams. Or else [he]_p296 would see a room in a rich house, where [his]_p298 friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at [his]_p299 dreams and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by [his]_p299 side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, [he]_p297 must rise and do [its]_p301 bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night and if at any time [he]_p302 dozed over, [it]_p303 was but to see [it]_p304 glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave [her]_p305 screaming. And still the figure had no face by which [he]_p306 might know [it]_p307 even in [his]_p310 dreams, [it]_p308 had no face, or one that baffled [him]_p312 and melted before [his]_p311 eyes and thus [it]_p308 was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer's mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real [Mr Hyde]_n55. If [he]_p313 could but once set eyes on him, [he]_p314 thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. [He]_p315 might see a reason for [his]_p316 friend's strange preference or bondage (call [it]_p317 which [you]_p318 please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least [it]_p319 would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show [itself]_p320 to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable [Enfield]_n56 , a spirit of enduring hatred. From that time forward, [Mr Utterson]_n57 began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on [his]_p321 chosen post. ""If [he]_p322 be [Mr Hyde]_n58 ,"".",4,,29,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p323 had thought,. ""I shall be Mr Seek. And at last [his]_p324 patience was rewarded. [It]_p325 was a fine dry night frost in the air the streets as clean as a ballroom floor the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o'clock, when the shops were closed the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded [him]_p326 by a long time. [Mr Utterson]_n59 had been some minutes at [his]_p327 post, when [he]_p328 was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. In the course of [his]_p329 nightly patrols, [he]_p330 had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while [he]_p331 is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet [his]_p332 attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested and [it]_p333 was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that [he]_p334 withdrew into the entry of the court. The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as [they]_p335 turned the end of the street.",1,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man [he]_p336 had to deal with. [He]_p337 was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher's inclination. But [he]_p338 made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time and as [he]_p339 came, [he]_p339 drew a key from [his]_p341 pocket like one approaching home. [Mr Utterson]_n60 stepped out and touched [him]_p342 on the shoulder as [he]_p343 passed. ""[Mr Hyde]_n61 , [I]_p344 think? [Mr Hyde]_n62 shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But [his]_p345 fear was only momentary and though [he]_p346 did not look the lawyer in the face, [he]_p347 answered coolly enough:. ""That is [my]_p348 name. What do [you]_p349 want?. ""I see [you]_p350 are going in,"". returned the lawyer.",3,,15,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""I am an old friend of Dr Jekyll's, Mr Utterson of Gaunt Street, [you]_p353 must have heard of [my]_p356 name and meeting [you]_p354 so conveniently, [I]_p351 thought [you]_p354 might admit me. ""You will not find Dr Jekyll [he]_p357 is from home,"". replied [Mr Hyde]_n63 , blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,. ""How did [you]_p358 know me?"". [he]_p359 asked. ""On [your]_p360 side,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n64. ""will [you]_p361 do [me]_p362 a favour?. ""With pleasure,"".",2,,11,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," replied the other. ""What shall [it]_p363 be?. ""Will [you]_p364 let [me]_p365 see [your]_p366 face?"". asked the lawyer. [Mr Hyde]_n65 appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. ""Now [I]_p367 shall know [you]_p368 again,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n66. ""It may be useful. ""Yes,"". returned [Mr Hyde]_n67 ,.",3,,6,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""It is as well [we]_p369 have met and apropos, [you]_p370 should have [my]_p371 address. "". And [he]_p372 gave a number of a street in Soho. ""Good God!"". thought [Mr Utterson]_n68 ,. ""can he, too, have been thinking of the will?"". But [he]_p373 kept [his]_p374 feelings to [himself]_p375 and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address. ""And now,"". said the other,. ""how did [you]_p376 know me?.",1,,8,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""By description,"". was the reply. ""Whose description?. ""We have common friends,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n69. ""Common friends,"". echoed [Mr Hyde]_n70 , a little hoarsely. ""Who are they?. ""[Jekyll]_n71 , for instance,"". said the lawyer.",3,,0,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""He never told you,"". cried [Mr Hyde]_n72 , with a flush of anger. ""I did not think [you]_p377 would have lied. ""Come,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n73 ,. ""that is not fitting language. The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, [he]_p378 had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house. The lawyer stood awhile when [Mr Hyde]_n74 had left him, the picture of disquietude. Then [he]_p379 began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting [his]_p380 hand to [his]_p381 brow like a man in mental perplexity. The problem [he]_p382 was thus debating as [he]_p383 walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved.",3,,7,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [Mr Hyde]_n75 was pale and dwarfish, [he]_p384 gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, [he]_p385 had a displeasing smile, [he]_p385 had borne [himself]_p388 to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and [he]_p386 spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice all these were points against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which [Mr Utterson]_n76 regarded him. ""There must be something else,"". said the perplexed gentleman. ""There is something more, if [I]_p389 could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall [we]_p390 say? or can [it]_p391 be the old story of [Dr Fell]_n77 ? or is [it]_p392 the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, [its]_p394 clay continent? The last, [I]_p395 think for, O [my]_p397 poor old [Harry Jekyll]_n78 , if ever [I]_p396 read Satan's signature upon a face, [it]_p392 is on that of [your]_p398 new friend. Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from [their]_p399 high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men  map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though [it]_p400 was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight, [Mr Utterson]_n79 stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door. ""Is Dr Jekyll at home, Poole?"". asked the lawyer.",5,,17,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""I will see, [Mr Utterson]_n80 ,"". said Poole, admitting the visitor, as [he]_p401 spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. ""Will [you]_p402 wait here by the fire, sir? or shall [I]_p404 give [you]_p403 a light in the dining-room?. ""Here, thank you,"". said the lawyer, and [he]_p405 drew near and leaned on the tall fender. This hall, in which [he]_p406 was now left alone, was a pet fancy of [his]_p407 friend the doctor's and [Utterson]_n81 [himself]_p408 was wont to speak of [it]_p409 as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder in [his]_p410 blood the face of [Hyde]_n82 sat heavy on [his]_p411 memory [he]_p413 felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life and in the gloom of [his]_p411 spirits, [he]_p414 seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. [He]_p415 was ashamed of [his]_p416 relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr Jekyll was gone out. ""I saw [Mr Hyde]_n83 go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,"". [he]_p417 said.",4,,17,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Is that right, when Dr Jekyll is from home?. ""Quite right, [Mr Utterson]_n84 , sir,"". replied the servant. ""[Mr Hyde]_n85 has a key. ""Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man, Poole,"". resumed the other musingly. ""Yes, sir, [he]_p418 does indeed,"". said Poole. ""We have all orders to obey him. ""I do not think [I]_p419 ever met [Mr Hyde]_n86 ?"".",3,,2,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," asked [Utterson]_n87. ""O, dear no, sir. [He]_p421 never dines here,"". replied the butler. ""Indeed [we]_p422 see very little of [him]_p423 on this side of the house [he]_p424 mostly comes and goes by the laboratory. ""Well, good-night, Poole. ""Good-night, [Mr Utterson]_n88. And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. ""[Poor Harry Jekyll]_n89 ,"". [he]_p425 thought,.",3,,5,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""my mind misgives [me]_p426 [he]_p427 is in deep waters! [He]_p429 was wild when [he]_p428 was young a long while ago to be sure but in the law of God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, [it]_p430 must be that the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, [PEDE CLAUDO]_n90 , years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault. "". And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on [his]_p431 own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there. [His]_p432 past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of [their]_p433 life with less apprehension yet [he]_p434 was humbled to the dust by the many ill things [he]_p435 had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many [he]_p435 had come so near to doing yet avoided. And then by a return on [his]_p437 former subject, [he]_p438 conceived a spark of hope. ""This Master [Hyde]_n91 , if [he]_p439 were studied,"". thought he,. ""must have secrets of [his]_p440 own black secrets, by the look of [him]_p441 secrets compared to which poor [Jekyll]_n92 's worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot continue as [they]_p442 are.",3,,17,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p443 turns [me]_p444 cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to [Harry]_n93 's bedside poor [Harry]_n94 , what a wakening! And the danger of [it]_p445 for if this [[Hyde]_n95 ]_n96 suspects the existence of the will, [he]_p446 may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, [I]_p447 must put [my]_p448 shoulders to the wheel, if [Jekyll]_n97 will but let me,"". [he]_p449 added,. ""if [Jekyll]_n98 will only let me. "". For once more [he]_p450 saw before [his]_p451 mind's eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will. DR. [JEKYLL]_n99 WAS QUITE AT EASE A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of [his]_p452 pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine and [Mr Utterson]_n100 so contrived that [he]_p453 remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where [Utterson]_n101 was liked, [he]_p454 was liked well.",9,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already [their]_p455 foot on the threshold [they]_p457 liked to sit a while in [his]_p458 unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering [their]_p456 minds in the man's rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr Jekyll was no exception and as [he]_p459 now sat on the opposite side of the fire, a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a stylish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness, [you]_p461 could see by [his]_p462 looks that [he]_p460 cherished for Mr Utterson a sincere and warm affection. ""I have been wanting to speak to you, [Jekyll]_n102 ,"". began the latter. ""You know that will of yours?   A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful but the doctor carried [it]_p463 off gaily. ""My poor [Utterson]_n103 ,"". said he,. ""you are unfortunate in such a client. [I]_p464 never saw a man so distressed as [you]_p465 were by [my]_p466 will unless [it]_p468 were that hide-bound pedant, [Lanyon]_n104 , at what [he]_p469 called [my]_p467 scientific heresies. O, [I]_p470 know he's a good fellow, [you]_p472 needn't frown, an excellent fellow, and [I]_p471 always mean to see more of [him]_p473 but a hide-bound pedant for all that an ignorant, blatant pedant.",3,,19,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p474 was never more disappointed in any man than [Lanyon]_n105. ""You know [I]_p475 never approved of it,"". pursued [Utterson]_n106 , ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic. ""My will? Yes, certainly, [I]_p476 know that,"". said the doctor, a trifle sharply. ""You have told [me]_p477 so. ""Well, [I]_p478 tell [you]_p479 so again,"". continued the lawyer. ""I have been learning something of young [Hyde]_n107. The large handsome face of Dr Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about [his]_p480 eyes.",3,,7,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""I do not care to hear more,  said he. ""This is a matter [I]_p481 thought [we]_p482 had agreed to drop. ""What [I]_p483 heard was abominable,"". said [Utterson]_n108. ""It can make no change. [You]_p484 do not understand [my]_p485 position,"". returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. ""I am painfully situated, [Utterson]_n109 [my]_p486 position is a very strange, a very strange one. [It]_p487 is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking. ""[Jekyll]_n110 ,"".",3,,7,

Make a clean breast of this in confidence and [I]_p489 make no doubt [I]_p490 can get [you]_p491 out of it. ""My good [Utterson]_n112 ,"". said the doctor,. ""this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and [I]_p495 cannot find words to thank [you]_p492 in. [I]_p496 believe [you]_p502 fully [I]_p497 would trust [you]_p503 before any man alive, ay, before myself, if [I]_p497 could make the choice but indeed [it]_p506 isn't what [you]_p503 fancy [it]_p507 is not as bad as that and just to put [your]_p508 good heart at rest, [I]_p498 will tell [you]_p504 one thing: the moment [I]_p498 choose, [I]_p498 can be rid of [Mr Hyde]_n113. [I]_p509 give [you]_p514 [my]_p518 hand upon that and [I]_p510 thank [you]_p515 again and again and [I]_p510 will just add one little word, [Utterson]_n114 , that I'm sure you'll take in good part: this is a private matter, and [I]_p511 beg of [you]_p515 to let [it]_p519 sleep. [Utterson]_n115 reflected a little, looking in the fire. ""I have no doubt [you]_p520 are perfectly right,"".",5,,29,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p521 said at last, getting to [his]_p522 feet. ""Well, but since [we]_p523 have touched upon this business, and for the last time [I]_p524 hope,"". continued the doctor,. ""there is one point [I]_p525 should like [you]_p526 to understand. [I]_p527 have really a very great interest in poor [Hyde]_n116. [I]_p528 know [you]_p530 have seen [him]_p531 [he]_p532 told [me]_p534 so and [I]_p529 fear [he]_p533 was rude. But [I]_p535 do sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man and if [I]_p536 am taken away, [Utterson]_n117 , [I]_p536 wish [you]_p538 to promise [me]_p540 that [you]_p539 will bear with [him]_p541 and get [his]_p543 rights for him. [I]_p544 think [you]_p545 would, if [you]_p546 knew all  and [it]_p548 would be a weight off [my]_p549 mind if [you]_p546 would promise. ""I can't pretend that [I]_p550 shall ever like him,"". said the lawyer.",2,,29,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""I don't ask that,"". pleaded [Jekyll]_n118 , laying [his]_p552 hand upon the other's arm. ""I only ask for justice [I]_p553 only ask [you]_p556 to help [him]_p557 for [my]_p558 sake, when [I]_p554 am no longer here. [Utterson]_n119 heaved an irrepressible sigh. ""Well,"". said he,. ""I promise. THE CAREW [MURDER CASE]_n120 Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18, , London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven.",3,,6,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid's window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. [It]_p559 seems [she]_p560 was romantically given, for [she]_p561 sat down upon [her]_p562 box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when [she]_p563 narrated that experience), never had [she]_p564 felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world. And as [she]_p566 so sat [she]_p567 became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at first [she]_p567 paid less attention. When [they]_p569 had come within speech (which was just under the maid's eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness. [It]_p570 did not seem as if the subject of [his]_p571 address were of great importance indeed, from [his]_p572 pointing, [it]_p575 some times appeared as if [he]_p578 were only inquiring [his]_p572 way  but the moon shone on [his]_p573 face as [he]_p579 spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, [it]_p576 seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently [her]_p580 eye wandered to the other, and [she]_p582 was surprised to recognise in [him]_p584 a certain [Mr Hyde]_n121 , who had once visited [her]_p581 master and for whom [she]_p583 had conceived a dislike. [He]_p585 had in [his]_p586 hand a heavy cane, with which [he]_p587 was trifling but [he]_p588 answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden [he]_p589 broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with [his]_p590 foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt and at that [Mr Hyde]_n122 broke out of all bounds and clubbed [him]_p591 to the earth.",2,,31,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," And next moment, with ape-like fury, [he]_p592 was trampling [his]_p593 victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted. [It]_p594 was two o'clock when [she]_p595 came to [herself]_p596 and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago but there lay [his]_p597 victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been done, although [it]_p598 was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter, the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which [he]_p599 had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of [Mr Utterson]_n123. This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before [he]_p600 was out of bed and [he]_p601 had no sooner seen [it]_p603 and been told the circumstances, than [he]_p601 shot out a solemn lip. ""I shall say nothing till [I]_p604 have seen the body,"". said [he]_p606. ""this may be very serious.",1,,14,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Have the kindness to wait while [I]_p607 dress. "". And with the same grave countenance [he]_p608 hurried through [his]_p609 breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been carried. As soon as [he]_p610 came into the cell, [he]_p611 nodded. ""Yes,"". said he,. ""I recognise him. [I]_p612 am sorry to say that this is [Sir Danvers Carew]_n124. ""Good God, sir,"". exclaimed the officer,.",1,,6,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""is [it]_p613 possible?"". And the next moment [his]_p614 eye lighted up with professional ambition. ""This will make a deal of noise,"". [he]_p615 said. ""And perhaps [you]_p616 can help [us]_p617 to the man. "". And [he]_p618 briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick. [Mr Utterson]_n125 had already quailed at the name of [Hyde]_n126 but when the stick was laid before him, [he]_p619 could doubt no longer broken and battered as [it]_p622 was, [he]_p620 recognized [it]_p623 for one that [he]_p620 had [himself]_p624 presented many years before to [Henry Jekyll]_n127. ""Is this [Mr Hyde]_n128 a person of small stature?"". [he]_p625 inquired.",4,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid calls him,"". said the officer. [Mr Utterson]_n129 reflected and then, raising [his]_p626 head,. ""If [you]_p627 will come with [me]_p628 in [my]_p629 cab,"". [he]_p630 said,. ""I think [I]_p631 can take [you]_p633 to [his]_p634 house. [It]_p635 was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours so that as the cab crawled from street to street, [Mr Utterson]_n130 beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight for here [it]_p636 would be dark like the back-end of evening and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with [its]_p637 muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and [its]_p638 lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer's eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of [his]_p639 mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye and when [he]_p641 glanced at the companion of [his]_p640 drive, [he]_p642 was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law's officers, which may at times assail the most honest.",2,,16,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed [him]_p643 a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut [him]_p644 off from [his]_p645 blackguardly surroundings. This was the home of [Henry Jekyll]_n131 's favourite of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling. An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. [She]_p646 had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but [her]_p647 manners were excellent. Yes, [she]_p648 said, this was [Mr Hyde]_n132 's, but [he]_p650 was not at home [he]_p651 had been in that night very late, but [he]_p651 had gone away again in less than an hour there was nothing strange in that [his]_p654 habits were very irregular, and [he]_p652 was often absent for instance, [it]_p655 was nearly two months since [she]_p649 had seen [him]_p656 till yesterday. ""Very well, then, [we]_p657 wish to see [his]_p658 rooms,"". said the lawyer and when the woman began to declare [it]_p659 was impossible,. ""I had better tell [you]_p660 who this person is,"". [he]_p661 added. ""This is [Inspector Newcomen]_n133 of [Scotland Yard]_n134.",4,,19,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman's face. ""Ah!"". said she,. ""he is in trouble! What has [he]_p662 done? [Mr Utterson]_n135 and the inspector exchanged glances. ""He don't seem a very popular character,"". observed the latter. ""And now, [my]_p664 good woman, just let [me]_p665 and this gentleman have a look about us. In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, [Mr Hyde]_n136 had only used a couple of rooms but these were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with wine the plate was of silver, the napery elegant a good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as [Utterson]_n137 supposed) from [Henry Jekyll]_n138 , who was much of a connoisseur and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked clothes lay about the floor, with [their]_p666 pockets inside out lock-fast drawers stood open and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned.",4,,4,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire the other half of the stick was found behind the door and as this clinched [his]_p667 suspicions, the officer declared [himself]_p668 delighted. A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's credit, completed [his]_p669 gratification. ""You may depend upon it, sir,"". [he]_p670 told [Mr Utterson]_n139 :. ""I have [him]_p671 in [my]_p672 hand. [He]_p673 must have lost [his]_p674 head, or [he]_p675 never would have left the stick or, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money's life to the man. [We]_p676 have nothing to do but wait for [him]_p677 at the bank, and get out the handbills. This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment for [Mr Hyde]_n140 had numbered few familiars, even the master of the servant maid had only seen [him]_p678 twice [his]_p680 family could nowhere be traced [he]_p681 had never been photographed and the few who could describe [him]_p679 differed widely, as common observers will. Only on one point were [they]_p682 agreed and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed [his]_p683 beholders.",2,,17,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," INCIDENT OF THE LETTER   [It]_p684 was late in the afternoon, when Mr Utterson found [his]_p685 way to Dr Jekyll's door, where [he]_p686 was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon and [his]_p687 own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden. [It]_p688 was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of [his]_p689 friend's quarters and [he]_p690 eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as [he]_p691 crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize and through this, [Mr Utterson]_n141 was at last received into the doctor's cabinet. [It]_p692 was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The fire burned in the grate a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr Jekyll, looking deathly sick. [He]_p693 did not rise to meet [his]_p694 visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade [him]_p695 welcome in a changed voice. ""And now,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n142 , as soon as Poole had left them,. ""you have heard the news?   The doctor shuddered.",2,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""They were crying [it]_p696 in the square,"". [he]_p697 said. ""I heard [them]_p698 in [my]_p699 dining-room. ""One word,"". said the lawyer. ""[Carew]_n143 was [my]_p700 client, but so are you, and [I]_p701 want to know what [I]_p702 am doing. [You]_p703 have not been mad enough to hide this fellow?. ""[Utterson]_n144 , [I]_p704 swear to God,"". cried the doctor,. ""I swear to God [I]_p705 will never set eyes on [him]_p707 again.",2,,11,

And indeed [he]_p714 does not want [my]_p718 help [you]_p720 do not know [him]_p721 as [I]_p722 do [he]_p715 is safe, [he]_p715 is quite safe mark [my]_p719 words, [he]_p716 will never more be heard of. The lawyer listened gloomily [he]_p723 did not like [his]_p724 friend's feverish manner. ""You seem pretty sure of him,"". said [he]_p725. ""and for [your]_p726 sake, [I]_p727 hope [you]_p728 may be right. If [it]_p729 came to a trial, [your]_p730 name might appear. ""I am quite sure of him,"". replied [Jekyll]_n145.",1,,23,

[I]_p734 have, [I]_p735 have received a letter and [I]_p735 am at a loss whether [I]_p736 should show [it]_p738 to the police. [I]_p739 should like to leave [it]_p742 in [your]_p743 hands, [Utterson]_n146 [you]_p744 would judge wisely, [I]_p740 am sure [I]_p740 have so great a trust in you. ""You fear, [I]_p746 suppose, that [it]_p747 might lead to [his]_p748 detection?"". asked the lawyer. ""No,"". said the other. ""I cannot say that [I]_p749 care what becomes of [Hyde]_n147 [I]_p750 am quite done with him. [I]_p752 was thinking of [my]_p753 own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed.",2,,20,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [Utterson]_n148 ruminated awhile [he]_p754 was surprised at [his]_p755 friend's selfishness, and yet relieved by it. ""Well,"". said he, at last,. ""let [me]_p756 see the letter. The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed. ""Edward Hyde : and [it]_p757 signified, briefly enough, that the writer's benefactor, Dr Jekyll, whom [he]_p758 had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for [his]_p761 safety, as [he]_p759 had means of escape on which [he]_p759 placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked this letter well enough [it]_p762 put a better colour on the intimacy than [he]_p763 had looked for and [he]_p764 blamed [himself]_p765 for some of [his]_p766 past suspicions. ""Have [you]_p767 the envelope?"". [he]_p768 asked. ""I burned it,"".",1,,15,

""Shall [I]_p772 keep this and sleep upon it?"". asked [Utterson]_n150. ""I wish [you]_p773 to judge for [me]_p774 entirely,"". was the reply. ""I have lost confidence in myself. ""Well, [I]_p775 shall consider,"".",2,,7,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," returned the lawyer. ""And now one word more: [it]_p776 was [Hyde]_n151 who dictated the terms in [your]_p777 will about that disappearance? The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness [he]_p778 shut [his]_p779 mouth tight and nodded. ""I knew it,"". said [Utterson]_n152. ""He meant to murder you. [You]_p780 had a fine escape. ""I have had what is far more to the purpose,"". returned the doctor solemnly:. ""I have had a lesson, O God, [Utterson]_n153 , what a lesson [I]_p781 have had!"". And [he]_p783 covered [his]_p784 face for a moment with [his]_p785 hands.",3,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," On [his]_p786 way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole. ""By the bye,"". said he,. ""there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger like?"". But Poole was positive nothing had come except by post. ""and only circulars by that,"". [he]_p787 added. This news sent off the visitor with [his]_p788 fears renewed. Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door possibly, indeed, [it]_p789 had been written in the cabinet and if that were so, [it]_p790 must be differently judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as [he]_p791 went, were crying [themselves]_p792 hoarse along the footways:.",0,,7,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Special edition. Shocking murder of an M. P. "". That was the funeral oration of one friend and client and [he]_p793 could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. [It]_p794 was, at least, a ticklish decision that [he]_p795 had to make and self-reliant as [he]_p796 was by habit, [he]_p796 began to cherish a longing for advice. [It]_p798 was not to be had directly but perhaps, [he]_p799 thought, [it]_p800 might be fished for. Presently after, [he]_p801 sat on one side of [his]_p802 own hearth, with [Mr Guest]_n154 , [his]_p803 head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of [his]_p803 house. The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds, the procession of the town's life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the room was gay with firelight.",1,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," In the bottle the acids were long ago resolved the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows richer in stained windows and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom [he]_p805 kept fewer secrets than [Mr Guest]_n155 and [he]_p806 was not always sure that [he]_p806 kept as many as [he]_p807 meant. [Guest]_n156 had often been on business to the doctor's [he]_p809 knew Poole [he]_p810 could scarce have failed to hear of [Mr Hyde]_n157 's familiarity about the house [he]_p810 might draw conclusions: was [it]_p814 not as well, then, that [he]_p811 should see a letter which put that mystery to right? and above all since [Guest]_n158 , being a great student and critic of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The clerk, besides, was a man of counsel [he]_p811 could scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark and by that remark [[Mr Utterson]_n159 ]_n160 might shape [his]_p815 future course. ""This is a sad business about [Sir Danvers]_n161 ,"". [he]_p816 said. ""Yes, sir, indeed. [It]_p817 has elicited a great deal of public feeling, returned [Guest]_n162. ""The man, of course, was mad. ""I should like to hear [your]_p818 views on that,"".",8,,14,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," replied [Utterson]_n163. ""I have a document here in [his]_p821 handwriting [it]_p822 is between ourselves, for [I]_p819 scarce know what to do about [it]_p823 [it]_p824 is an ugly business at the best. But there [it]_p825 is quite in [your]_p826 way: a murderer's autograph. [Guest]_n164 's eyes brightened, and [he]_p827 sat down at once and studied [it]_p828 with passion. ""No sir,"". [he]_p829 said:. ""not mad but [it]_p830 is an odd hand. ""And by all accounts a very odd writer,"". added the lawyer. Just then the servant entered with a note.",2,,11,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Is that from Dr Jekyll, sir?"". inquired the clerk. ""I thought [I]_p831 knew the writing. Anything private, [Mr Utterson]_n165 ?. ""Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do [you]_p833 want to see it?. ""One moment. [I]_p834 thank you, sir "". and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper alongside and sedulously compared [their]_p835 contents. ""Thank you, sir,"".",1,,4,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p836 said at last, returning both. ""it's a very interesting autograph. There was a pause, during which [Mr Utterson]_n166 struggled with himself. ""Why did [you]_p837 compare them, [Guest]_n167 ?"". [he]_p838 inquired suddenly. ""Well, sir,"". returned the clerk,. ""there's a rather singular resemblance  the two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped. ""Rather quaint,"". said [Utterson]_n168.",3,,3,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""It is, as [you]_p839 say, rather quaint,"". returned [Guest]_n169. ""I wouldn't speak of this note, [you]_p840 know,"". said the master. ""No, sir,"". said the clerk. ""I understand. But no sooner was [Mr Utterson]_n170 alone that night, than [he]_p841 locked the note into [his]_p842 safe, where [it]_p843 reposed from that time forward. ""What!"". [he]_p844 thought.",2,,6,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[Henry Jekyll]_n171 forge for a murderer!"". And [his]_p845 blood ran cold in [his]_p846 veins. INCIDENT OF DR. [LANYON]_n172 [Time]_n173 ran on thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death of [Sir Danvers]_n174 was resented as a public injury but [Mr Hyde]_n175 had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though [he]_p847 had never existed. Much of [his]_p848 past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came out of the man's cruelty, at once so callous and violent of [his]_p849 vile life, of [his]_p849 strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded [his]_p850 career but of [his]_p850 present whereabouts, not a whisper. From the time [he]_p853 had left the house in Soho on the morning of the murder, [he]_p854 was simply blotted out and gradually, as time drew on, [Mr Utterson]_n176 began to recover from the hotness of [his]_p855 alarm, and to grow more at quiet with himself. The death of [Sir Danvers]_n177 was, to [his]_p856 way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of [Mr Hyde]_n178. Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr Jekyll. [He]_p857 came out of [his]_p858 seclusion, renewed relations with [his]_p859 friends, became once more [their]_p860 familiar guest and entertainer and whilst [he]_p861 had always been known for charities, [he]_p862 was now no less distinguished for religion. [He]_p863 was busy, [he]_p864 was much in the open air, [he]_p865 did good [his]_p866 face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace.",8,,22,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," On the 8th of [January Utterson]_n179 had dined at the doctor's with a small party [Lanyon]_n180 had been there and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against the lawyer. ""The doctor was confined to the house,"". Poole said,. ""and saw no one. "". On the 15th, [he]_p867 tried again, and was again refused and having now been used for the last two months to see [his]_p869 friend almost daily, [he]_p868 found this return of solitude to weigh upon [his]_p870 spirits. The fifth night [he]_p871 had in [Guest]_n181 to dine with [him]_p873 and the sixth [he]_p872 betook [himself]_p874 to [Dr Lanyon]_n182 's. There at least [he]_p875 was not denied admittance but when [he]_p876 came in, [he]_p876 was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor's appearance. [He]_p878 had [his]_p879 death-warrant written legibly upon [his]_p880 face.",4,,14,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," The rosy man had grown pale [his]_p881 flesh had fallen away [he]_p882 was visibly balder and older  and yet [it]_p883 was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer's notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. [It]_p884 was unlikely that the doctor should fear death and yet that was what [Utterson]_n183 was tempted to suspect. ""Yes,"". [he]_p885 thought. ""he is a doctor, [he]_p886 must know [his]_p889 own state and that [his]_p890 days are counted and the knowledge is more than [he]_p887 can bear. "". And yet when [Utterson]_n184 remarked on [his]_p891 ill-looks, [it]_p892 was with an air of great firmness that [Lanyon]_n185 declared [himself]_p893 a doomed man. ""I have had a shock,"". [he]_p894 said,. ""and [I]_p895 shall never recover.",3,,14,

[I]_p901 sometimes think if [we]_p902 knew all, [we]_p903 should be more glad to get away. ""[Jekyll]_n186 is ill, too,"". observed [Utterson]_n187. ""Have [you]_p904 seen him? But [Lanyon]_n188 's face changed, and [he]_p905 held up a trembling hand. ""I wish to see or hear no more of Dr Jekyll,"". [he]_p906 said in a loud, unsteady voice. ""I am quite done with that person and [I]_p907 beg that [you]_p910 will spare [me]_p911 any allusion to one whom [I]_p908 regard as dead. ""Tut-tut,"".",3,,14,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said [Mr Utterson]_n189 and then after a considerable pause,. ""Can't [I]_p912 do anything?"". [he]_p913 inquired. ""We are three very old friends, [Lanyon]_n190 [we]_p914 shall not live to make others. ""Nothing can be done,"". returned [Lanyon]_n191. ""ask himself. ""He will not see me,"". said the lawyer. ""I am not surprised at that,"".",3,,3,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," was the reply. ""Some day, [Utterson]_n192 , after [I]_p915 am dead, [you]_p916 may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. [I]_p917 cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if [you]_p918 can sit and talk with [me]_p920 of other things, for God's sake, stay and do so but if [you]_p919 cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in God's name, go, for [I]_p921 cannot bear it. As soon as [he]_p922 got home, [Utterson]_n193 sat down and wrote to [Jekyll]_n194 , complaining of [his]_p923 exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break with [Lanyon]_n195 and the next day brought [him]_p924 a long answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift. The quarrel with [Lanyon]_n196 was incurable. ""I do not blame [our]_p925 old friend,"". [Jekyll]_n197 wrote,. ""but [I]_p926 share [his]_p927 view that [we]_p928 must never meet. [I]_p929 mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion [you]_p930 must not be surprised, nor must [you]_p931 doubt [my]_p933 friendship, if [my]_p934 door is often shut even to you.",6,,19,

[I]_p938 have brought on [myself]_p940 a punishment and a danger that [I]_p939 cannot name. If [I]_p941 am the chief of sinners, [I]_p942 am the chief of sufferers also. [I]_p943 could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning and [you]_p944 can do but one thing, [Utterson]_n198 , to lighten this destiny, and that is to respect [my]_p945 silence. "". [Utterson]_n199 was amazed the dark influence of [Hyde]_n200 had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to [his]_p946 old tasks and amities a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of [his]_p947 life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness but in view of [Lanyon]_n201 's manner and words, there must lie for [it]_p948 some deeper ground. A week afterwards [Dr Lanyon]_n202 took to [his]_p949 bed, and in something less than a fortnight [he]_p950 was dead. The night after the funeral, at which [he]_p951 had been sadly affected, [Utterson]_n203 locked the door of [his]_p952 business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before [him]_p954 an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of [his]_p953 dead friend. ""PRIVATE: for the hands of G.",6,,20,

""I have buried one friend to-day,"". [he]_p957 thought:. ""what if this should cost [me]_p958 another?"". And then [he]_p959 condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as. ""not to be opened till the death or disappearance of [Dr Henry Jekyll]_n205. "".",2,,5,

Yes, [it]_p961 was disappearance here again, as in the mad will which [he]_p962 had long ago restored to [its]_p963 author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of [Henry Jekyll]_n207 bracketted. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man [Hyde]_n208 [it]_p964 was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of [Lanyon]_n209 , what should [it]_p965 mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries but professional honour and faith to [his]_p966 dead friend were stringent obligations and the packet slept in the inmost corner of [his]_p967 private safe. [It]_p968 is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer [it]_p969 and [it]_p970 may be doubted if, from that day forth, [Utterson]_n210 desired the society of [his]_p971 surviving friend with the same eagerness. [He]_p972 thought of [him]_p973 kindly but [his]_p974 thoughts were disquieted and fearful. [He]_p975 went to call indeed but [he]_p976 was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance perhaps, in [his]_p978 heart, [he]_p977 preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with [its]_p979 inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, [it]_p980 appeared, now more than ever confined [himself]_p982 to the cabinet over the laboratory, where [he]_p983 would sometimes even sleep [he]_p984 was out of spirits, [he]_p984 had grown very silent, [he]_p985 did not read [it]_p981 seemed as if [he]_p985 had something on [his]_p988 mind. [Utterson]_n211 became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that [he]_p989 fell off little by little in the frequency of [his]_p990 visits.",6,,31,

""Well,"". said [Enfield]_n215 ,. ""that story's at an end at least. [We]_p995 shall never see more of [Mr Hyde]_n216. ""I hope not,"". said [Utterson]_n217. ""Did [I]_p996 ever tell [you]_p998 that [I]_p997 once saw him, and shared [your]_p999 feeling of repulsion?. ""It was impossible to do the one without the other,"". returned [Enfield]_n218.",7,,9,

The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr Jekyll. ""What!

But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile was struck out of [his]_p1030 face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below. [They]_p1031 saw [it]_p1032 but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down  but that glimpse had been sufficient, and [they]_p1033 turned and left the court without a word.",2,,14,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," In silence, too, [they]_p1034 traversed the by-street and [it]_p1036 was not until [they]_p1035 had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon a [Sunday]_n226 there were still some stirrings of life, that [Mr Utterson]_n227 at last turned and looked at [his]_p1037 companion. [They]_p1038 were both pale and there was an answering horror in [their]_p1039 eyes. ""God forgive us, God forgive us,"". said [Mr Utterson]_n228. But [Mr Enfield]_n229 only nodded [his]_p1040 head very seriously, and walked on once more in silence. THE [LAST]_n230 [NIGHT]_n231 [Mr Utterson]_n232 was sitting by [his]_p1041 fireside one evening after dinner, when [he]_p1042 was surprised to receive a visit from Poole. ""[Bless]_n233 me, Poole, what brings [you]_p1043 here?"". [he]_p1044 cried and then taking a second look at him,. ""What ails you?"". [he]_p1045 added.",8,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""is the doctor ill?. ""[Mr Utterson]_n234 ,"". said the man,. ""there is something wrong. ""Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,"". said the lawyer. ""Now, take [your]_p1046 time, and tell [me]_p1047 plainly what [you]_p1048 want. ""You know the doctor's ways, sir,"". replied Poole,. ""and how [he]_p1049 shuts [himself]_p1050 up.",1,,5,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Well, he's shut up again in the cabinet and [I]_p1051 don't like it, sir, [I]_p1052 wish [I]_p1052 may die if [I]_p1053 like it. [Mr Utterson]_n235 , sir, I'm afraid. ""Now, [my]_p1055 good man,"". said the lawyer,. ""be explicit. What are [you]_p1056 afraid of?. ""I've been afraid for about a week,"". returned Poole, doggedly disregarding the question,. ""and [I]_p1057 can bear [it]_p1058 no more. The man's appearance amply bore out [his]_p1059 words [his]_p1060 manner was altered for the worse and except for the moment when [he]_p1062 had first announced [his]_p1060 terror, [he]_p1063 had not once looked the lawyer in the face.",1,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Even now, [he]_p1064 sat with the glass of wine untasted on [his]_p1065 knee, and [his]_p1066 eyes directed to a corner of the floor. ""I can bear [it]_p1067 no more,"". [he]_p1068 repeated. ""Come,"". said the lawyer,. ""I see [you]_p1071 have some good reason, Poole [I]_p1069 see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell [me]_p1072 what [it]_p1073 is. ""I think there's been foul play,"". said Poole, hoarsely. ""Foul play!"".",0,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence. ""What foul play! What does the man mean?. ""I daren't say, sir,"". was the answer. ""but will [you]_p1074 come along with [me]_p1075 and see for yourself? [Mr Utterson]_n236 's only answer was to rise and get [his]_p1076 hat and greatcoat but [he]_p1077 observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butler's face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was still untasted when [he]_p1078 set [it]_p1079 down to follow. [It]_p1080 was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying on [her]_p1081 back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. [It]_p1083 seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides for [Mr Utterson]_n237 thought [he]_p1084 had never seen that part of London so deserted. [He]_p1085 could have wished [it]_p1086 otherwise never in [his]_p1087 life had [he]_p1090 been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch [his]_p1088 fellow-creatures for struggle as [he]_p1091 might, there was borne in upon [his]_p1088 mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square, when [they]_p1092 got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing [themselves]_p1093 along the railing.",2,,19,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off [his]_p1094 hat and mopped [his]_p1095 brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of [his]_p1096 coming, these were not the dews of exertion that [he]_p1099 wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish for [his]_p1097 face was white and [his]_p1097 voice, when [he]_p1100 spoke, harsh and broken. ""Well, sir,"". [he]_p1101 said,. ""here [we]_p1102 are, and God grant there be nothing wrong. ""Amen, Poole,"". said the lawyer. Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner the door was opened on the chain and a voice asked from within,. ""Is that you, Poole?. ""It's all right,"".",0,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said Poole. ""Open the door. The hall, when [they]_p1103 entered it, was brightly lighted up the fire was built high and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of [Mr Utterson]_n238 , the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering and the cook, crying out. ""[Bless God]_n239 ! it's [Mr Utterson]_n240 ,"". ran forward as if to take [him]_p1104 in [her]_p1105 arms. ""What, what? Are [you]_p1106 all here?"". said the lawyer peevishly. ""Very irregular, very unseemly [your]_p1107 master would be far from pleased. ""They're all afraid,"".",3,,5,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said Poole. Blank silence followed, no one protesting only the maid lifted [her]_p1108 voice and now wept loudly. ""Hold [your]_p1109 tongue!"". Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that testified to [his]_p1112 own jangled nerves and indeed, when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of [her]_p1110 lamentation, [they]_p1113 had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. ""And now,"". continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy,. ""reach [me]_p1114 a candle, and we'll get this through hands at once. "". And then [he]_p1115 begged [Mr Utterson]_n241 to follow him, and led the way to the back garden. ""Now, sir,"".",1,,7,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," said he,. ""you come as gently as [you]_p1116 can. [I]_p1118 want [you]_p1120 to hear, and [I]_p1119 don't want [you]_p1121 to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any chance [he]_p1122 was to ask [you]_p1123 in, don't go. [Mr Utterson]_n242 's nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk that nearly threw [him]_p1124 from [his]_p1125 balance but [he]_p1127 recollected [his]_p1126 courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the surgical theatre, with [its]_p1128 lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of the stair. Here Poole motioned [him]_p1129 to stand on one side and listen  while [he]_p1130 himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on [his]_p1131 resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door. ""[Mr Utterson]_n243 , sir, asking to see you,"". [he]_p1132 called and even as [he]_p1133 did so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear. A voice answered from within:.

stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [it]_p1136 said complainingly. ""Thank you, sir,"". said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in [his]_p1137 voice and taking up [his]_p1138 candle, [he]_p1139 led [Mr Utterson]_n244 back across the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor. ""Sir,"". [he]_p1140 said, looking [Mr Utterson]_n245 in the eyes,. ""Was that [my]_p1141 master's voice?. ""It seems much changed,"". replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look for look. ""Changed? Well, yes, [I]_p1142 think so,"". said the butler.",2,,7,

""This is a very strange tale, Poole this is rather a wild tale [my]_p1150 man, said [Mr Utterson]_n247 , biting [his]_p1151 finger. ""Suppose [it]_p1152 were as [you]_p1154 suppose, supposing Dr Jekyll to have been, well, murdered what could induce the murderer to stay?

[It]_p1162 was sometimes [his]_p1163 way, the master's, that is, to write [his]_p1164 orders on a sheet of paper and throw [it]_p1165 on the stair.

Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and [I]_p1166 have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time [I]_p1167 brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling [me]_p1168 to return it, because [it]_p1169 was not pure, and another order to a different firm.

""Dr Jekyll presents [his]_p1174 compliments to Messrs. Maw. [He]_p1175 assures [them]_p1176 that [their]_p1177 last sample is impure and quite useless for [his]_p1178 present purpose.

stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p1201 was but for one minute that [I]_p1202 saw him, but the hair stood upon [my]_p1203 head like quills.

There is [my]_p1222 explanation [it]_p1223 is sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider but [it]_p1224 is plain and natural, hangs well together, and delivers [us]_p1225 from all exorbitant alarms.

No, sir, that thing in the mask was never Dr Jekyll, God knows what [it]_p1240 was, but [it]_p1241 was never Dr Jekyll and [it]_p1241 is the belief of [my]_p1236 heart that there was murder done.

[You]_p1281 have not forgot, sir, that at the time of the murder [he]_p1282 had still the key with him? But that's not all.

[he]_p1327 said and taking the poker under [his]_p1328 arm, led the way into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and [it]_p1329 was now quite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about [their]_p1330 steps, until [they]_p1331 came into the shelter of the theatre, where [they]_p1332 sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around but nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.",0,,16,

But hark again, a little closer, put [your]_p1337 heart in [your]_p1338 ears, [Mr Utterson]_n265 , and tell me, is that the doctor's foot? The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all [they]_p1339 went so slowly [it]_p1334 was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of [Henry Jekyll]_n266.

Poole swung the axe over [his]_p1357 shoulder the blow shook the building, and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded four times the blow fell but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship and [it]_p1358 was not until the fifth, that the lock burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet. The besiegers, appalled by [their]_p1359 own riot and the stillness that had succeeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet before [their]_p1360 eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing [its]_p1361 thin strain, a drawer or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer the fire, the things laid out for tea the quietest room, [you]_p1362 would have said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most commonplace that night in London. Right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and still twitching.

[He]_p1366 was dressed in clothes far too large for him, clothes of the doctor's bigness the cords of [his]_p1367 face still moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone: and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air, [Utterson]_n275 knew that [he]_p1368 was looking on the body of a self-destroyer.",5,,12,

[Hyde]_n276 is gone to [his]_p1370 account and [it]_p1371 only remains for [us]_p1372 to find the body of [your]_p1373 master. The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre, which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end and looked upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these [they]_p1374 now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from [their]_p1375 doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was [Jekyll]_n277 's predecessor but even as [they]_p1376 opened the door [they]_p1377 were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.",2,,9,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," No where was there any trace of [Henry Jekyll]_n278 dead or alive. Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. ""He must be buried here,"". [he]_p1378 said, hearkening to the sound. ""Or [he]_p1379 may have fled,"". said [Utterson]_n279 , and [he]_p1380 turned to examine the door in the by-street. [It]_p1381 was locked and lying near by on the flags, [they]_p1382 found the key, already stained with rust. ""This does not look like use,"". observed the lawyer. ""Use!"".",2,,5,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," echoed Poole. ""Do [you]_p1383 not see, sir, [it]_p1384 is broken? much as if a man had stamped on it. ""Ay,"". continued [Utterson]_n280 ,. ""and the fractures, too, are rusty. "". The two men looked at each other with a scare. ""This is beyond me, Poole,"". said the lawyer. ""Let [us]_p1386 go back to the cabinet.",1,,3,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [They]_p1387 mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented. ""That is the same drug that [I]_p1388 was always bringing him,"". said Poole and even as [he]_p1389 spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over. This brought [them]_p1390 to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter's elbow, the very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf one lay beside the tea things open, and [Utterson]_n281 was amazed to find [it]_p1391 a copy of a pious work, for which [Jekyll]_n282 had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in [his]_p1392 own hand with startling blasphemies. Next, in the course of [their]_p1393 review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths [they]_p1394 looked with an involuntary horror. But [it]_p1395 was so turned as to show [them]_p1396 nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and [their]_p1397 own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in. ""This glass has seen some strange things, sir,"". whispered Poole.",2,,11,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""And surely none stranger than itself,"". echoed the lawyer in the same tones. ""For what did [Jekyll]_n283 , [he]_p1398 caught [himself]_p1399 up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness,. ""what could [Jekyll]_n284 want with it?"". [he]_p1400 said. ""You may say that!"". said Poole. Next [they]_p1401 turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor's hand, the name of [Mr Utterson]_n285. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor.",3,,4,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which [he]_p1402 had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance but in place of the name of [Edward Hyde]_n286 , the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of [Gabriel John Utterson]_n287. [He]_p1403 looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet. ""My head goes round,"". [he]_p1404 said. ""He has been all these days in possession [he]_p1405 had no cause to like [me]_p1408 [he]_p1406 must have raged to see [himself]_p1409 displaced and [he]_p1406 has not destroyed this document. [He]_p1410 caught up the next paper [it]_p1411 was a brief note in the doctor's hand and dated at the top. ""O Poole!"". the lawyer cried,. ""he was alive and here this day. [He]_p1412 cannot have been disposed of in so short a space [he]_p1413 must be still alive, [he]_p1414 must have fled! And then, why fled? and how? and in that case, can [we]_p1415 venture to declare this suicide? O, [we]_p1416 must be careful.",2,,15,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p1417 foresee that [we]_p1418 may yet involve [your]_p1419 master in some dire catastrophe. ""Why don't [you]_p1420 read it, sir?"". asked Poole. ""Because [I]_p1421 fear,"". replied the lawyer solemnly. ""God grant [I]_p1422 have no cause for it!"". And with that [he]_p1423 brought the paper to [his]_p1424 eyes and read as follows:. ""My dear [Utterson]_n288 ,, When this shall fall into [your]_p1425 hands, [I]_p1426 shall have disappeared, under what circumstances [I]_p1427 have not the penetration to foresee, but [my]_p1428 instinct and all the circumstances of [my]_p1429 nameless situation tell [me]_p1430 that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and first read the narrative which [Lanyon]_n289 warned [me]_p1431 [he]_p1432 was to place in [your]_p1433 hands and if [you]_p1434 care to hear more, turn to the confession of. ""Your unworthy and unhappy friend,.",2,,18,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""[HENRY]_n290 [JEKYLL]_n291. ""There was a third enclosure?"". asked [Utterson]_n292. ""Here, sir,"". said Poole, and gave into [his]_p1435 hands a considerable packet sealed in several places. The lawyer put [it]_p1436 in [his]_p1437 pocket. ""I would say nothing of this paper. If [your]_p1438 master has fled or is dead, [we]_p1439 may at least save [his]_p1440 credit. [It]_p1441 is now ten [I]_p1442 must go home and read these documents in quiet but [I]_p1443 shall be back before midnight, when [we]_p1444 shall send for the police. [They]_p1445 went out, locking the door of the theatre behind [them]_p1446 and [Utterson]_n293 , once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall, trudged back to [his]_p1447 office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained.",4,,13,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," DR. [LANYON]_n294 'S NARRATIVE On the ninth of [January]_n295 , now four days ago, [I]_p1448 received by the evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of [my]_p1449 colleague and old school companion, [Henry Jekyll]_n296. [I]_p1450 was a good deal surprised by this for [we]_p1453 were by no means in the habit of correspondence [I]_p1451 had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before and [I]_p1451 could imagine nothing in [our]_p1454 intercourse that should justify formality of registration. The contents increased [my]_p1455 wonder for this is how the letter ran:. ""10th December, 18,. ""[Dear Lanyon]_n297 ,, [You]_p1456 are one of [my]_p1457 oldest friends and although [we]_p1459 may have differed at times on scientific questions, [I]_p1460 cannot remember, at least on [my]_p1458 side, any break in [our]_p1461 affection. There was never a day when, if [you]_p1462 had said to me, `[Jekyll]_n298 , [my]_p1465 life, [my]_p1466 honour, [my]_p1466 reason, depend upon you,' [I]_p1469 would not have sacrificed [my]_p1467 left hand to help you. [Lanyon]_n299 [my]_p1470 life, [my]_p1471 honour, [my]_p1471 reason, are all at [your]_p1473 mercy if [you]_p1474 fail [me]_p1475 to-night, [I]_p1476 am lost. [You]_p1477 might suppose, after this preface, that [I]_p1478 am going to ask [you]_p1479 for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for yourself.",6,,30,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""I want [you]_p1480 to postpone all other engagements for to-night, ay, even if [you]_p1481 were summoned to the bedside of an emperor to take a cab, unless [your]_p1482 carriage should be actually at the door and with this letter in [your]_p1483 hand for consultation, to drive straight to [my]_p1484 house. Poole, [my]_p1485 butler, has [his]_p1486 orders [you]_p1487 will find [him]_p1488 waiting [your]_p1489 arrival with a locksmith. The door of [my]_p1490 cabinet is then to be forced: and [you]_p1491 are to go in alone to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if [it]_p1492 be shut and to draw out, with all [its]_p1493 contents as [they]_p1494 stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom. In [my]_p1495 extreme distress of mind, [I]_p1496 have a morbid fear of misdirecting [you]_p1498 but even if [I]_p1497 am in error, [you]_p1499 may know the right drawer by [its]_p1500 contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book. This drawer [I]_p1501 beg of [you]_p1502 to carry back with [you]_p1503 to [Cavendish Square]_n300 exactly as [it]_p1504 stands. ""That is the first part of the service: now for the second. [You]_p1505 should be back, if [you]_p1506 set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight but [I]_p1508 will leave [you]_p1507 that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when [your]_p1509 servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, [I]_p1510 have to ask [you]_p1511 to be alone in [your]_p1514 consulting room, to admit with [your]_p1515 own hand into the house a man who will present [himself]_p1516 in [my]_p1517 name, and to place in [his]_p1519 hands the drawer that [you]_p1512 will have brought with [you]_p1512 from [my]_p1518 cabinet. Then [you]_p1520 will have played [your]_p1521 part and earned [my]_p1522 gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if [you]_p1523 insist upon an explanation, [you]_p1524 will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as [they]_p1526 must appear, [you]_p1524 might have charged [your]_p1527 conscience with [my]_p1528 death or the shipwreck of [my]_p1529 reason.",1,,50,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," ""Confident as [I]_p1530 am that [you]_p1531 will not trifle with this appeal, [my]_p1532 heart sinks and [my]_p1533 hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility. Think of [me]_p1534 at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if [you]_p1536 will but punctually serve me, [my]_p1537 troubles will roll away like a story that is told. Serve me, [my]_p1538 dear [Lanyon]_n301 and save. ""Your friend,. ""H. J. ""P. S. , [I]_p1539 had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon [my]_p1540 soul. [It]_p1541 is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter not come into [your]_p1542 hands until to-morrow morning.",1,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," In that case, dear [Lanyon]_n302 , do [my]_p1543 errand when [it]_p1545 shall be most convenient for [you]_p1546 in the course of the day and once more expect [my]_p1544 messenger at midnight. [It]_p1547 may then already be too late and if that night passes without event, [you]_p1548 will know that [you]_p1549 have seen the last of [Henry Jekyll]_n303. Upon the reading of this letter, [I]_p1550 made sure [my]_p1552 colleague was insane  but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, [I]_p1551 felt bound to do as [he]_p1553 requested. The less [I]_p1554 understood of this farrago, the less [I]_p1555 was in a position to judge of [its]_p1556 importance and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. [I]_p1557 rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to [Jekyll]_n304 's house. The butler was awaiting [my]_p1558 arrival [he]_p1559 had received by the same post as [mine]_p1560 a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while [we]_p1561 were yet speaking and [we]_p1562 moved in a body to old [Dr Denman]_n305 's surgical theatre, from which (as [you]_p1563 are doubtless aware) [Jekyll]_n306 's private cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock excellent the carpenter avowed [he]_p1564 would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used and the locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour's work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked and [I]_p1565 took out the drawer, had [it]_p1566 filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with [it]_p1567 to [Cavendish Square]_n307.",6,,25,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Here [I]_p1568 proceeded to examine [its]_p1569 contents. The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist so that [it]_p1570 was plain [they]_p1571 were of [Jekyll]_n308 's private manufacture: and when [I]_p1572 opened one of the wrappers [I]_p1573 found what seemed to [me]_p1574 a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which [I]_p1575 next turned [my]_p1576 attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to [me]_p1577 to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients [I]_p1578 could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many years, but [I]_p1579 observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single word:. ""double"". occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation,. ""total failure!!!"".",1,,12,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," All this, though [it]_p1580 whetted [my]_p1581 curiosity, told [me]_p1582 little that was definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of [Jekyll]_n309 's investigations) to no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these articles in [my]_p1583 house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of [my]_p1584 flighty colleague? If [his]_p1586 messenger could go to one place, why could [he]_p1587 not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by [me]_p1588 in secret? The more [I]_p1589 reflected the more convinced [I]_p1590 grew that [I]_p1590 was dealing with a case of cerebral disease and though [I]_p1591 dismissed [my]_p1584 servants to bed, [I]_p1591 loaded an old revolver, that [I]_p1591 might be found in some posture of self-defence. Twelve o'clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door. [I]_p1595 went [myself]_p1596 at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico. ""Are [you]_p1597 come from Dr Jekyll?"". [I]_p1598 asked. [He]_p1599 told [me]_p1600. ""yes"". by a constrained gesture and when [I]_p1601 had bidden [him]_p1602 enter, [he]_p1603 did not obey [me]_p1604 without a searching backward glance into the darkness of the square.",1,,25,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," There was a policeman not far off, advancing with [his]_p1605 bull's eye open and at the sight, [I]_p1606 thought [my]_p1607 visitor started and made greater haste. These particulars struck me, [I]_p1608 confess, disagreeably and as [I]_p1609 followed [him]_p1611 into the bright light of the consulting room, [I]_p1609 kept [my]_p1612 hand ready on [my]_p1613 weapon. Here, at last, [I]_p1614 had a chance of clearly seeing him. [I]_p1615 had never set eyes on [him]_p1616 before, so much was certain. [He]_p1617 was small, as [I]_p1618 have said [I]_p1619 was struck besides with the shocking expression of [his]_p1620 face, with [his]_p1621 remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and, last but not least, with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by [his]_p1621 neighbourhood. This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse. At the time, [I]_p1623 set [it]_p1625 down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms  but [I]_p1624 have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred. This person (who had thus, from the first moment of [his]_p1626 entrance, struck in [me]_p1631 what [I]_p1632 can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable [his]_p1627 clothes, that is to say, although [they]_p1633 were of rich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for [him]_p1634 in every measurement, the trousers hanging on [his]_p1627 legs and rolled up to keep [them]_p1635 from the ground, the waist of the coat below [his]_p1628 haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon [his]_p1628 shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving [me]_p1636 to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced me, something seizing, surprising and revolting, this fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce [it]_p1637 so that to [my]_p1638 interest in the man's nature and character, there was added a curiosity as to [his]_p1639 origin, [his]_p1640 life, [his]_p1640 fortune and status in the world.",0,,37,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," These observations, though [they]_p1642 have taken so great a space to be set down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. [My]_p1643 visitor was, indeed, on fire with sombre excitement. ""Have [you]_p1644 got it?"". [he]_p1645 cried. ""Have [you]_p1646 got it?"". And so lively was [his]_p1647 impatience that [he]_p1649 even laid [his]_p1648 hand upon [my]_p1650 arm and sought to shake me. [I]_p1651 put [him]_p1652 back, conscious at [his]_p1653 touch of a certain icy pang along [my]_p1654 blood. ""Come, sir,"". said I. ""You forget that [I]_p1655 have not yet the pleasure of [your]_p1656 acquaintance.",0,,15,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Be seated, if [you]_p1657 please. "". And [I]_p1658 showed [him]_p1660 an example, and sat down [myself]_p1661 in [my]_p1662 customary seat and with as fair an imitation of [my]_p1663 ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of [my]_p1663 preoccupations, and the horror [I]_p1659 had of [my]_p1664 visitor, would suffer [me]_p1666 to muster. ""I beg [your]_p1667 pardon, [Dr Lanyon]_n310 ,"". [he]_p1668 replied civilly enough. ""What [you]_p1669 say is very well founded and [my]_p1670 impatience has shown [its]_p1672 heels to [my]_p1671 politeness. [I]_p1673 come here at the instance of [your]_p1675 colleague, [Dr Henry Jekyll]_n311 , on a piece of business of some moment and [I]_p1674 understood. "". [He]_p1676 paused and put [his]_p1677 hand to [his]_p1678 throat, and [I]_p1680 could see, in spite of [his]_p1678 collected manner, that [he]_p1681 was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria,. ""I understood, a drawer.",2,,25,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But here [I]_p1682 took pity on [my]_p1683 visitor's suspense, and some perhaps on [my]_p1684 own growing curiosity. ""There [it]_p1685 is, sir,"". said I, pointing to the drawer, where [it]_p1686 lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet. [He]_p1687 sprang to it, and then paused, and laid [his]_p1688 hand upon [his]_p1689 heart: [I]_p1694 could hear [his]_p1689 teeth grate with the convulsive action of [his]_p1690 jaws and [his]_p1690 face was so ghastly to see that [I]_p1695 grew alarmed both for [his]_p1690 life and reason. ""Compose yourself,"". said I. [He]_p1696 turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, [he]_p1697 uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that [I]_p1698 sat petrified. And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control,. ""Have [you]_p1699 a graduated glass?"".",0,,18,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [he]_p1700 asked. [I]_p1701 rose from [my]_p1702 place with something of an effort and gave [him]_p1703 what [he]_p1704 asked. [He]_p1705 thanked [me]_p1706 with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to a watery green. [My]_p1707 visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned and looked upon [me]_p1708 with an air of scrutiny. ""And now,"". said he,. ""to settle what remains. Will [you]_p1709 be wise? will [you]_p1710 be guided? will [you]_p1710 suffer [me]_p1715 to take this glass in [my]_p1716 hand and to go forth from [your]_p1717 house without further parley? or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you? Think before [you]_p1711 answer, for [it]_p1718 shall be done as [you]_p1711 decide.",0,,18,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," As [you]_p1719 decide, [you]_p1720 shall be left as [you]_p1720 were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul. Or, if [you]_p1722 shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in this room, upon the instant and [your]_p1724 sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan. ""Sir,"". said I, affecting a coolness that [I]_p1725 was far from truly possessing,. ""you speak enigmas, and [you]_p1727 will perhaps not wonder that [I]_p1730 hear [you]_p1728 with no very strong impression of belief. But [I]_p1731 have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before [I]_p1732 see the end. ""It is well,"". replied [my]_p1733 visitor. ""[Lanyon]_n312 , [you]_p1734 remember [your]_p1735 vows: what follows is under the seal of [our]_p1736 profession. And now, [you]_p1737 who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, [you]_p1738 who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, [you]_p1738 who have derided [your]_p1740 superiors, behold!   [He]_p1741 put the glass to [his]_p1742 lips and drank at one gulp.",1,,21,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," A cry followed  [he]_p1743 reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth and as [I]_p1745 looked there came, [I]_p1746 thought, a change, [he]_p1744 seemed to swell, [his]_p1748 face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter, and the next moment, [I]_p1746 had sprung to [my]_p1749 feet and leaped back against the wall, [my]_p1750 arms raised to shield [me]_p1752 from that prodigy, [my]_p1750 mind submerged in terror. ""O God!"". [I]_p1753 screamed, and. ""O God!"". again and again for there before [my]_p1754 eyes, pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before [him]_p1756 with [his]_p1757 hands, like a man restored from death, there stood [Henry Jekyll]_n313 ! What [he]_p1758 told [me]_p1759 in the next hour, [I]_p1760 cannot bring [my]_p1755 mind to set on paper. [I]_p1761 saw what [I]_p1762 saw, [I]_p1762 heard what [I]_p1763 heard, and [my]_p1768 soul sickened at [it]_p1770 and yet now when that sight has faded from [my]_p1769 eyes, [I]_p1763 ask [myself]_p1772 if [I]_p1763 believe it, and [I]_p1764 cannot answer. [My]_p1773 life is shaken to [its]_p1774 roots sleep has left [me]_p1775 the deadliest terror sits by [me]_p1776 at all hours of the day and night and [I]_p1777 feel that [my]_p1780 days are numbered, and that [I]_p1778 must die  and yet [I]_p1778 shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, [I]_p1781 can not, even in memory, dwell on [it]_p1782 without a start of horror. [I]_p1783 will say but one thing, [Utterson]_n314 , and that (if [you]_p1784 can bring [your]_p1785 mind to credit it) will be more than enough. The creature who crept into [my]_p1786 house that night was, on [Jekyll]_n315 's own confession, known by the name of [Hyde]_n316 and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of [Carew]_n317.",5,,43,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [HASTIE]_n318 [LANYON]_n319 [HENRY]_n320 [JEKYLL]_n321 'S FULL STATEMENT OF THE [CASE]_n322 [I]_p1787 was born in the year 18, to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among [my]_p1788 fellowmen, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future. And indeed the worst of [my]_p1789 faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as [I]_p1792 found [it]_p1793 hard to reconcile with [my]_p1790 imperious desire to carry [my]_p1790 head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public. Hence [it]_p1794 came about that [I]_p1795 concealed [my]_p1798 pleasures and that when [I]_p1796 reached years of reflection, and began to look round [me]_p1800 and take stock of [my]_p1799 progress and position in the world, [I]_p1796 stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as [I]_p1801 was guilty of but from the high views that [I]_p1802 had set before me, [I]_p1802 regarded and hid [them]_p1804 with an almost morbid sense of shame. [It]_p1805 was thus rather the exacting nature of [my]_p1806 aspirations than any particular degradation in [my]_p1807 faults, that made [me]_p1808 what [I]_p1810 was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in [me]_p1809 those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man's dual nature. In this case, [I]_p1811 was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer, [I]_p1812 was in no sense a hypocrite both sides of [me]_p1816 were in dead earnest  [I]_p1813 was no more [myself]_p1817 when [I]_p1813 laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when [I]_p1814 laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering. And [it]_p1818 chanced that the direction of [my]_p1819 scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among [my]_p1820 members. With every day, and from both sides of [my]_p1821 intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, [I]_p1822 thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery [I]_p1823 have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. [I]_p1824 say two, because the state of [my]_p1825 own knowledge does not pass beyond that point.",5,,39,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Others will follow, others will outstrip [me]_p1826 on the same lines  and [I]_p1827 hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for [my]_p1828 part, from the nature of [my]_p1829 life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only. [It]_p1830 was on the moral side, and in [my]_p1831 own person, that [I]_p1834 learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man [I]_p1835 saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of [my]_p1832 consciousness, even if [I]_p1835 could rightly be said to be either, [it]_p1839 was only because [I]_p1836 was radically both and from an early date, even before the course of [my]_p1832 scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, [I]_p1836 had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements. If each, [I]_p1840 told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable the unjust might go [his]_p1841 way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of [his]_p1842 more upright twin and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on [his]_p1842 upward path, doing the good things in which [he]_p1845 found [his]_p1843 pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. [It]_p1846 was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together, that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then were [they]_p1847 dissociated?  [I]_p1848 was so far in [my]_p1850 reflections when, as [I]_p1849 have said, a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. [I]_p1851 began to perceive more deeply than [it]_p1852 has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in which [we]_p1853 walk attired. Certain agents [I]_p1854 found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, [I]_p1855 will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of [my]_p1856 confession. First, because [I]_p1857 have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of [our]_p1858 life is bound for ever on man's shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast [it]_p1859 off, [it]_p1860 but returns upon [us]_p1861 with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure.",0,,36,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Second, because, as [my]_p1862 narrative will make, alas! too evident, [my]_p1863 discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that [I]_p1864 not only recognised [my]_p1865 natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up [my]_p1866 spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from [their]_p1868 supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to [me]_p1869 because [they]_p1870 were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements in [my]_p1866 soul. [I]_p1871 hesitated long before [I]_p1872 put this theory to the test of practice. [I]_p1873 knew well that [I]_p1874 risked death for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which [I]_p1874 looked to [it]_p1876 to change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm. [I]_p1877 had long since prepared [my]_p1881 tincture [I]_p1878 purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt which [I]_p1878 knew, from [my]_p1882 experiments, to be the last ingredient required and late one accursed night, [I]_p1879 compounded the elements, watched [them]_p1883 boil and smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off the potion. The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and [I]_p1884 came to [myself]_p1885 as if out of a great sickness. There was something strange in [my]_p1886 sensations, something indescribably new and, from [its]_p1887 very novelty, incredibly sweet. [I]_p1888 felt younger, lighter, happier in body  within [I]_p1889 was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in [my]_p1890 fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul.",0,,29,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p1891 knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to [my]_p1892 original evil and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted [me]_p1893 like wine. [I]_p1894 stretched out [my]_p1897 hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations and in the act, [I]_p1895 was suddenly aware that [I]_p1895 had lost in stature. There was no mirror, at that date, in [my]_p1898 room that which stands beside [me]_p1899 as [I]_p1900 write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations. The night however, was far gone into the morning, the morning, black as [it]_p1901 was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day, the inmates of [my]_p1902 house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber and [I]_p1905 determined, flushed as [I]_p1906 was with hope and triumph, to venture in [my]_p1903 new shape as far as to [my]_p1903 bedroom. [I]_p1907 crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, [I]_p1908 could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that [their]_p1911 unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to [them]_p1912 [I]_p1908 stole through the corridors, a stranger in [my]_p1913 own house and coming to [my]_p1914 room, [I]_p1909 saw for the first time the appearance of [Edward Hyde]_n323. [I]_p1915 must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which [I]_p1916 know, but that which [I]_p1916 suppose to be most probable. The evil side of [my]_p1918 nature, to which [I]_p1919 had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good which [I]_p1920 had just deposed. Again, in the course of [my]_p1921 life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, [it]_p1922 had been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as [I]_p1923 think, [it]_p1924 came about that [Edward Hyde]_n324 was so much smaller, slighter and younger than [Henry Jekyll]_n325. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other.",3,,34,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Evil besides (which [I]_p1925 must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when [I]_p1926 looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, [I]_p1927 was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself. [It]_p1928 seemed natural and human. In [my]_p1929 eyes [it]_p1930 bore a livelier image of the spirit, [it]_p1931 seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance [I]_p1932 had been hitherto accustomed to call mine. And in so far [I]_p1933 was doubtless right. [I]_p1934 have observed that when [I]_p1935 wore the semblance of [Edward Hyde]_n326 , none could come near to [me]_p1936 at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as [I]_p1937 take it, was because all human beings, as [we]_p1938 meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and [Edward Hyde]_n327 , alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil. [I]_p1939 lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted [it]_p1942 yet remained to be seen if [I]_p1940 had lost [my]_p1943 identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer [mine]_p1945 and hurrying back to [my]_p1944 cabinet, [I]_p1940 once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to [myself]_p1946 once more with the character, the stature and the face of [Henry Jekyll]_n328. That night [I]_p1947 had come to the fatal cross-roads.",3,,23,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Had [I]_p1948 approached [my]_p1951 discovery in a more noble spirit, had [I]_p1949 risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, [I]_p1949 had come forth an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action  [it]_p1952 was neither diabolical nor divine [it]_p1953 but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of [my]_p1954 disposition and like the captives of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth. At that time [my]_p1955 virtue slumbered [my]_p1956 evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion and the thing that was projected was [Edward Hyde]_n329. Hence, although [I]_p1957 had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old [Henry Jekyll]_n330 , that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement [I]_p1958 had already learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse. Even at that time, [I]_p1959 had not conquered [my]_p1960 aversions to the dryness of a life of study. [I]_p1961 would still be merrily disposed at times and as [my]_p1963 pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and [I]_p1962 was not only well known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of [my]_p1964 life was daily growing more unwelcome. [It]_p1965 was on this side that [my]_p1966 new power tempted [me]_p1967 until [I]_p1968 fell in slavery. [I]_p1969 had but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to assume, like a thick cloak, that of [Edward Hyde]_n331. [I]_p1970 smiled at the notion  [it]_p1972 seemed to [me]_p1973 at the time to be humourous and [I]_p1971 made [my]_p1974 preparations with the most studious care.",3,,27,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p1975 took and furnished that house in Soho, to which [Hyde]_n332 was tracked by the police and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom [I]_p1976 knew well to be silent and unscrupulous. On the other side, [I]_p1977 announced to [my]_p1980 servants that a [Mr Hyde]_n333 (whom [I]_p1978 described) was to have full liberty and power about [my]_p1981 house in the square and to parry mishaps, [I]_p1978 even called and made [myself]_p1983 a familiar object, in [my]_p1981 second character. [I]_p1984 next drew up that will to which [you]_p1986 so much objected so that if anything befell [me]_p1987 in the person of Dr Jekyll, [I]_p1985 could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as [I]_p1988 supposed, on every side, [I]_p1989 began to profit by the strange immunities of [my]_p1990 position. Men have before hired bravos to transact [their]_p1991 crimes, while [their]_p1992 own person and reputation sat under shelter. [I]_p1993 was the first that ever did so for [his]_p1994 pleasures. [I]_p1995 was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty. But for me, in [my]_p1996 impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think of it, [I]_p1997 did not even exist! Let [me]_p1999 but escape into [my]_p2001 laboratory door, give [me]_p2000 but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that [I]_p1998 had always standing ready and whatever [he]_p2002 had done, [Edward Hyde]_n334 would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror and there in [his]_p2003 stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in [his]_p2004 study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be [Henry Jekyll]_n335. The pleasures which [I]_p2005 made haste to seek in [my]_p2008 disguise were, as [I]_p2006 have said, undignified [I]_p2006 would scarce use a harder term.",4,,34,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But in the hands of [Edward Hyde]_n336 , [they]_p2009 soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When [I]_p2010 would come back from these excursions, [I]_p2011 was often plunged into a kind of wonder at [my]_p2012 vicarious depravity. This familiar that [I]_p2013 called out of [my]_p2014 own soul, and sent forth alone to do [his]_p2015 good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous [his]_p2016 every act and thought centered on self drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another relentless like a man of stone. [Henry Jekyll]_n337 stood at times aghast before the acts of [Edward Hyde]_n338 but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. [It]_p2017 was [Hyde]_n339 , after all, and [Hyde]_n340 alone, that was guilty. [Jekyll]_n341 was no worse [he]_p2018 woke again to [his]_p2020 good qualities seemingly unimpaired [he]_p2019 would even make haste, where [it]_p2021 was possible, to undo the evil done by [Hyde]_n342. And thus [his]_p2022 conscience slumbered. Into the details of the infamy at which [I]_p2023 thus connived (for even now [I]_p2024 can scarce grant that [I]_p2024 committed it) [I]_p2025 have no design of entering [I]_p2025 mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which [my]_p2028 chastisement approached. [I]_p2029 met with one accident which, as [it]_p2031 brought on no consequence, [I]_p2030 shall no more than mention. An act of cruelty to a child aroused against [me]_p2032 the anger of a passer-by, whom [I]_p2033 recognised the other day in the person of [your]_p2035 kinsman the doctor and the child's family joined [him]_p2036 there were moments when [I]_p2034 feared for [my]_p2037 life and at last, in order to pacify [their]_p2038 too just resentment, [Edward Hyde]_n343 had to bring [them]_p2039 to the door, and pay [them]_p2040 in a cheque drawn in the name of [Henry Jekyll]_n344.",9,,32,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of [Edward Hyde]_n345 [himself]_p2041 and when, by sloping [my]_p2042 own hand backward, [I]_p2044 had supplied [my]_p2043 double with a signature, [I]_p2045 thought [I]_p2045 sat beyond the reach of fate. Some two months before the murder of [Sir Danvers]_n346 , [I]_p2047 had been out for one of [my]_p2048 adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. [It]_p2049 was in vain [I]_p2050 looked about [me]_p2058 in vain [I]_p2051 saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of [my]_p2059 room in the square in vain that [I]_p2051 recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame something still kept insisting that [I]_p2052 was not where [I]_p2052 was, that [I]_p2052 had not wakened where [I]_p2053 seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where [I]_p2053 was accustomed to sleep in the body of [Edward Hyde]_n347. [I]_p2060 smiled to myself, and in [my]_p2062 psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as [I]_p2061 did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. [I]_p2063 was still so engaged when, in one of [my]_p2064 more wakeful moments, [my]_p2065 eyes fell upon [my]_p2065 hand. Now the hand of [Henry Jekyll]_n348 (as [you]_p2067 have often remarked) was professional in shape and size: [it]_p2068 was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which [I]_p2069 now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corder, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. [It]_p2070 was the hand of [Edward Hyde]_n349. [I]_p2071 must have stared upon [it]_p2074 for near half a minute, sunk as [I]_p2072 was in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in [my]_p2075 breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals and bounding from [my]_p2076 bed [I]_p2072 rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met [my]_p2077 eyes, [my]_p2078 blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy.",5,,38,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Yes, [I]_p2079 had gone to bed [Henry Jekyll]_n350 , [I]_p2080 had awakened [Edward Hyde]_n351. How was this to be explained? [I]_p2081 asked [myself]_p2083 and then, with another bound of terror, how was [it]_p2084 to be remedied? [It]_p2085 was well on in the morning the servants were up all [my]_p2086 drugs were in the cabinet, a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical theatre, from where [I]_p2082 was then standing horror-struck. [It]_p2087 might indeed be possible to cover [my]_p2088 face but of what use was that, when [I]_p2092 was unable to conceal the alteration in [my]_p2089 stature? And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, [it]_p2093 came back upon [my]_p2089 mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of [my]_p2090 second self. [I]_p2094 had soon dressed, as well as [I]_p2095 was able, in clothes of [my]_p2096 own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array and ten minutes later, Dr Jekyll had returned to [his]_p2097 own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting. Small indeed was [my]_p2098 appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal of [my]_p2099 previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of [my]_p2100 judgment and [I]_p2102 began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of [my]_p2100 double existence. That part of [me]_p2103 which [I]_p2105 had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished [it]_p2109 had seemed to [me]_p2104 of late as though the body of [Edward Hyde]_n352 had grown in stature, as though (when [I]_p2106 wore that form) [I]_p2106 were conscious of a more generous tide of blood and [I]_p2107 began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged, the balance of [my]_p2110 nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of [Edward Hyde]_n353 become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally displayed. Once, very early in [my]_p2111 career, [it]_p2113 had totally failed [me]_p2114  since then [I]_p2115 had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on [my]_p2112 contentment. Now, however, and in the light of that morning's accident, [I]_p2116 was led to remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of [Jekyll]_n354 , [it]_p2117 had of late gradually but decidedly transferred [itself]_p2118 to the other side.",5,,40,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," All things therefore seemed to point to this that [I]_p2119 was slowly losing hold of [my]_p2120 original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with [my]_p2121 second and worse. Between these two, [I]_p2122 now felt [I]_p2123 had to choose. [My]_p2124 two natures had memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them. [Jekyll]_n355 (who was composite) now with the most sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of [Hyde]_n356 but [Hyde]_n357 was indifferent to [Jekyll]_n358 , or but remembered [him]_p2125 as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which [he]_p2126 conceals [himself]_p2127 from pursuit. [Jekyll]_n359 had more than a father's interest [Hyde]_n360 had more than a son's indifference. To cast in [my]_p2128 lot with [Jekyll]_n361 , was to die to those appetites which [I]_p2129 had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast [it]_p2130 in with [Hyde]_n362 , was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal but there was still another consideration in the scales for while [Jekyll]_n363 would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, [Hyde]_n364 would be not even conscious of all that [he]_p2131 had lost. Strange as [my]_p2132 circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man  much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner and [it]_p2134 fell out with me, as [it]_p2135 falls with so vast a majority of [my]_p2133 fellows, that [I]_p2137 chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it. Yes, [I]_p2138 preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that [I]_p2139 had enjoyed in the disguise of [Hyde]_n365.",11,,20,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [I]_p2140 made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for [I]_p2141 neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of [Edward Hyde]_n366 , which still lay ready in [my]_p2142 cabinet. For two months, however, [I]_p2143 was true to [my]_p2146 determination for two months, [I]_p2144 led a life of such severity as [I]_p2144 had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate the freshness of [my]_p2147 alarm the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course [I]_p2148 began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of [Hyde]_n367 struggling after freedom and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, [I]_p2149 once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught. [I]_p2150 do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with [himself]_p2153 upon [his]_p2154 vice, [he]_p2156 is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that [he]_p2157 runs through [his]_p2155 brutish, physical insensibility neither had I, long as [I]_p2151 had considered [my]_p2158 position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of [Edward Hyde]_n368. Yet [it]_p2159 was by these that [I]_p2160 was punished. [My]_p2161 devil had been long caged, [he]_p2162 came out roaring. [I]_p2163 was conscious, even when [I]_p2164 took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill. [It]_p2165 must have been this, [I]_p2166 suppose, that stirred in [my]_p2170 soul that tempest of impatience with which [I]_p2167 listened to the civilities of [my]_p2171 unhappy victim [I]_p2167 declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation and that [I]_p2168 struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But [I]_p2172 had voluntarily stripped [myself]_p2173 of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of [us]_p2174 continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations and in [my]_p2175 case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall. Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in [me]_p2176 and raged.",3,,36,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," With a transport of glee, [I]_p2177 mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow  and [it]_p2179 was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that [I]_p2178 was suddenly, in the top fit of [my]_p2180 delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed [I]_p2181 saw [my]_p2182 life to be forfeit and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, [my]_p2183 lust of evil gratified and stimulated, [my]_p2183 love of life screwed to the topmost peg. [I]_p2185 ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed [my]_p2187 papers thence [I]_p2186 set out through the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on [my]_p2188 crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in [my]_p2188 wake for the steps of the avenger. [Hyde]_n369 had a song upon [his]_p2190 lips as [he]_p2191 compounded the draught, and as [he]_p2192 drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before [Henry Jekyll]_n370 , with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon [his]_p2193 knees and lifted [his]_p2194 clasped hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. [I]_p2195 saw [my]_p2198 life as a whole: [I]_p2196 followed [it]_p2201 up from the days of childhood, when [I]_p2196 had walked with [my]_p2199 father's hand, and through the self-denying toils of [my]_p2199 professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. [I]_p2202 could have screamed aloud [I]_p2203 sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which [my]_p2204 memory swarmed against [me]_p2207 and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of [my]_p2205 iniquity stared into [my]_p2205 soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, [it]_p2208 was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of [my]_p2209 conduct was solved.",2,,33,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [Hyde]_n371 was thenceforth impossible whether [I]_p2210 would or not, [I]_p2211 was now confined to the better part of [my]_p2216 existence and O, how [I]_p2211 rejoiced to think of it! with what willing humility [I]_p2212 embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation [I]_p2212 locked the door by which [I]_p2212 had so often gone and come, and ground the key under [my]_p2217 heel! The next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked, that the guilt of [Hyde]_n372 was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in public estimation. [It]_p2218 was not only a crime, [it]_p2219 had been a tragic folly. [I]_p2220 think [I]_p2221 was glad to know [it]_p2224 [I]_p2221 think [I]_p2222 was glad to have [my]_p2225 better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold. [Jekyll]_n373 was now [my]_p2226 city of refuge let but [Hyde]_n374 peep out an instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him. [I]_p2227 resolved in [my]_p2229 future conduct to redeem the past and [I]_p2228 can say with honesty that [my]_p2230 resolve was fruitful of some good. [You]_p2231 know [yourself]_p2232 how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, [I]_p2233 laboured to relieve suffering [you]_p2234 know that much was done for others, and that the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can [I]_p2235 truly say that [I]_p2236 wearied of this beneficent and innocent life [I]_p2236 think instead that [I]_p2237 daily enjoyed [it]_p2240 more completely but [I]_p2237 was still cursed with [my]_p2241 duality of purpose and as the first edge of [my]_p2242 penitence wore off, the lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl for licence. Not that [I]_p2243 dreamed of resuscitating [Hyde]_n375 the bare idea of that would startle [me]_p2246 to frenzy: no, [it]_p2247 was in [my]_p2249 own person that [I]_p2244 was once more tempted to trifle with [my]_p2250 conscience and [it]_p2248 was as an ordinary secret sinner that [I]_p2244 at last fell before the assaults of temptation. There comes an end to all things the most capacious measure is filled at last and this brief condescension to [my]_p2251 evil finally destroyed the balance of [my]_p2252 soul. And yet [I]_p2253 was not alarmed the fall seemed natural, like a return to the old days before [I]_p2254 had made [my]_p2255 discovery.",5,,46,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p2256 was a fine, clear, [January]_n376 day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead and the Regent's Park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. [I]_p2257 sat in the sun on a bench the animal within [me]_p2258 licking the chops of memory the spiritual side a little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin. After all, [I]_p2259 reflected, [I]_p2260 was like [my]_p2262 neighbours and then [I]_p2260 smiled, comparing [myself]_p2264 with other men, comparing [my]_p2263 active good-will with the lazy cruelty of [their]_p2265 neglect. And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left [me]_p2266 faint and then as in [its]_p2267 turn faintness subsided, [I]_p2268 began to be aware of a change in the temper of [my]_p2269 thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation. [I]_p2270 looked down [my]_p2271 clothes hung formlessly on [my]_p2272 shrunken limbs the hand that lay on [my]_p2272 knee was corded and hairy. [I]_p2274 was once more [Edward Hyde]_n377. A moment before [I]_p2275 had been safe of all men's respect, wealthy, beloved, the cloth laying for [me]_p2277 in the dining-room at home and now [I]_p2276 was the common quarry of mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows. [My]_p2278 reason wavered, but [it]_p2279 did not fail [me]_p2280 utterly. [I]_p2281 have more than once observed that in [my]_p2282 second character, [my]_p2283 faculties seemed sharpened to a point and [my]_p2283 spirits more tensely elastic thus [it]_p2285 came about that, where [Jekyll]_n378 perhaps might have succumbed, [Hyde]_n379 rose to the importance of the moment.",4,,30,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [My]_p2286 drugs were in one of the presses of [my]_p2287 cabinet how was [I]_p2290 to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing [my]_p2288 temples in [my]_p2288 hands) [I]_p2291 set [myself]_p2292 to solve. The laboratory door [I]_p2293 had closed. If [I]_p2294 sought to enter by the house, [my]_p2295 own servants would consign [me]_p2296 to the gallows. [I]_p2297 saw [I]_p2298 must employ another hand, and thought of [Lanyon]_n380. How was [he]_p2299 to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing that [I]_p2300 escaped capture in the streets, how was [I]_p2301 to make [my]_p2307 way into [his]_p2310 presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of [his]_p2311 colleague, Dr Jekyll? Then [I]_p2301 remembered that of [my]_p2308 original character, one part remained to me: [I]_p2302 could write [my]_p2308 own hand and once [I]_p2302 had conceived that kindling spark, the way that [I]_p2302 must follow became lighted up from end to end. Thereupon, [I]_p2312 arranged [my]_p2315 clothes as best [I]_p2313 could, and summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in [Portland Street]_n381 , the name of which [I]_p2313 chanced to remember. At [my]_p2316 appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal [his]_p2317 mirth. [I]_p2318 gnashed [my]_p2320 teeth upon [him]_p2321 with a gust of devilish fury and the smile withered from [his]_p2324 face, happily for him, yet more happily for myself, for in another instant [I]_p2319 had certainly dragged [him]_p2322 from [his]_p2325 perch. At the inn, as [I]_p2326 entered, [I]_p2327 looked about [me]_p2328 with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble not a look did [they]_p2331 exchange in [my]_p2332 presence but obsequiously took [my]_p2333 orders, led [me]_p2329 to a private room, and brought [me]_p2329 wherewithal to write. [Hyde]_n382 in danger of [his]_p2334 life was a creature new to [me]_p2335 shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain.",3,,48,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Yet the creature was astute mastered [his]_p2336 fury with a great effort of the will composed [his]_p2337 two important letters, one to [Lanyon]_n383 and one to Poole and that [he]_p2338 might receive actual evidence of [their]_p2339 being posted, sent [them]_p2340 out with directions that [they]_p2341 should be registered. Thenceforward, [he]_p2342 sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing [his]_p2345 nails there [he]_p2343 dined, sitting alone with [his]_p2346 fears, the waiter visibly quailing before [his]_p2346 eye and thence, when the night was fully come, [he]_p2343 set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, [I]_p2348 say, [I]_p2349 cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human nothing lived in [him]_p2351 but fear and hatred. And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, [he]_p2352 discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in [his]_p2353 misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within [him]_p2354 like a tempest. [He]_p2355 walked fast, hunted by [his]_p2356 fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided [him]_p2357 from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, [I]_p2358 think, a box of lights. [He]_p2359 smote [her]_p2360 in the face, and [she]_p2361 fled. When [I]_p2362 came to [myself]_p2365 at [Lanyon]_n384 's, the horror of [my]_p2366 old friend perhaps affected [me]_p2367 somewhat: [I]_p2363 do not know [it]_p2368 was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which [I]_p2363 looked back upon these hours. A change had come over me.",2,,32,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," [It]_p2369 was no longer the fear of the gallows, [it]_p2370 was the horror of being [Hyde]_n385 that racked me. [I]_p2371 received [Lanyon]_n386 's condemnation partly in a dream [it]_p2373 was partly in a dream that [I]_p2372 came home to [my]_p2374 own house and got into bed. [I]_p2375 slept after the prostration of the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung [me]_p2376 could avail to break. [I]_p2377 awoke in the morning shaken, weakened, but refreshed. [I]_p2378 still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me, and [I]_p2379 had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before but [I]_p2379 was once more at home, in [my]_p2381 own house and close to [my]_p2382 drugs and gratitude for [my]_p2382 escape shone so strong in [my]_p2383 soul that [it]_p2385 almost rivalled the brightness of hope. [I]_p2386 was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when [I]_p2387 was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change and [I]_p2387 had but the time to gain the shelter of [my]_p2390 cabinet, before [I]_p2388 was once again raging and freezing with the passions of [Hyde]_n387. [It]_p2391 took on this occasion a double dose to recall [me]_p2392 to [myself]_p2393 and alas! six hours after, as [I]_p2394 sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered. In short, from that day forth [it]_p2395 seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that [I]_p2396 was able to wear the countenance of [Jekyll]_n388. At all hours of the day and night, [I]_p2397 would be taken with the premonitory shudder above all, if [I]_p2398 slept, or even dozed for a moment in [my]_p2400 chair, [it]_p2401 was always as [Hyde]_n389 that [I]_p2398 awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which [I]_p2402 now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what [I]_p2403 had thought possible to man, [I]_p2403 became, in [my]_p2405 own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of [my]_p2406 other self.",5,,38,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But when [I]_p2407 slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, [I]_p2408 would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life. The powers of [Hyde]_n390 seemed to have grown with the sickliness of [Jekyll]_n391. And certainly the hate that now divided [them]_p2409 was equal on each side. With [Jekyll]_n392 , [it]_p2410 was a thing of vital instinct. [He]_p2411 had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with [him]_p2412 some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with [him]_p2413 to death: and beyond these links of community, which in [themselves]_p2414 made the most poignant part of [his]_p2415 distress, [he]_p2417 thought of [Hyde]_n393 , for all [his]_p2416 energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing  that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to [him]_p2418 closer than a wife, closer than an eye  lay caged in [his]_p2421 flesh, where [he]_p2422 heard [it]_p2423 mutter and felt [it]_p2424 struggle to be born and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed [him]_p2419 out of life. The hatred of [Hyde]_n394 for [Jekyll]_n395 was of a different order. [His]_p2425 terror of the gallows drove [him]_p2426 continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to [his]_p2427 subordinate station of a part instead of a person but [he]_p2428 loathed the necessity, [he]_p2429 loathed the despondency into which [Jekyll]_n396 was now fallen, and [he]_p2429 resented the dislike with which [he]_p2430 was [himself]_p2432 regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks that [he]_p2433 would play me, scrawling in [my]_p2437 own hand blasphemies on the pages of [my]_p2438 books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of [my]_p2438 father and indeed, had [it]_p2440 not been for [his]_p2441 fear of death, [he]_p2434 would long ago have ruined [himself]_p2442 in order to involve [me]_p2435 in the ruin.",7,,34,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," But [his]_p2443 love of [me]_p2444 is wonderful [I]_p2445 go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when [I]_p2446 recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when [I]_p2446 know how [he]_p2453 fears [my]_p2454 power to cut [him]_p2450 off by suicide, [I]_p2447 find [it]_p2456 in [my]_p2455 heart to pity him. [It]_p2457 is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this description no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice  and yet even to these, habit brought, no, not alleviation, but a certain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair and [my]_p2460 punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has finally severed [me]_p2458 from [my]_p2461 own face and nature. [My]_p2462 provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment, began to run low. [I]_p2463 sent out for a fresh supply and mixed the draught the ebullition followed, and the first change of colour, not the second [I]_p2464 drank [it]_p2465 and [it]_p2466 was without efficiency. [You]_p2467 will learn from Poole how [I]_p2468 have had London ransacked  [it]_p2470 was in vain and [I]_p2469 am now persuaded that [my]_p2472 first supply was impure, and that [it]_p2471 was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught. About a week has passed, and [I]_p2473 am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last time, short of a miracle, that [Henry Jekyll]_n397 can think [his]_p2474 own thoughts or see [his]_p2475 own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must [I]_p2476 delay too long to bring [my]_p2477 writing to an end for if [my]_p2478 narrative has hitherto escaped destruction, [it]_p2479 has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take [me]_p2480 in the act of writing it, [Hyde]_n398 will tear [it]_p2481 in pieces but if some time shall have elapsed after [I]_p2485 have laid [it]_p2482 by, [his]_p2486 wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save [it]_p2482 once again from the action of [his]_p2487 ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing on [us]_p2488 both has already changed and crushed him.",2,,41,
stevenson_the_strange_case_of_drjekyll_and_mrhyde," Half an hour from now, when [I]_p2489 shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, [I]_p2490 know how [I]_p2490 shall sit shuddering and weeping in [my]_p2492 chair, or continue, with the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of menace. Will [Hyde]_n399 die upon the scaffold? or will [he]_p2494 find courage to release [himself]_p2495 at the last moment? God knows [I]_p2496 am careless this is [my]_p2497 true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself. Here then, as [I]_p2498 lay down the pen and proceed to seal up [my]_p2500 confession, [I]_p2499 bring the life of that unhappy [Henry Jekyll]_n400 to an end.",2,,11,
