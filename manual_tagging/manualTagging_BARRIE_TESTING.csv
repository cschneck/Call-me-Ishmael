barrie_testing,"Chapter 1 [PETER]_n0 BREAKS THROUGH All children, except one, grow up. [They]_p0 soon know that [they]_p1 will grow up, and the way [Wendy]_n1 knew was this. One day when [she]_p2 was two years old [she]_p3 was playing in a garden, and [she]_p3 plucked another flower and ran with [it]_p5 to [her]_p6 mother. [I]_p7 suppose [she]_p8 must have looked rather delightful, for [Mrs Darling]_n2 put [her]_p9 hand to [her]_p10 heart and cried,. ""Oh, why can't [you]_p11 remain like this for ever!"". This was all that passed between [them]_p12 on the subject, but henceforth [Wendy]_n3 knew that [she]_p13 must grow up. [You]_p14 always know after [you]_p15 are two. Two is the beginning of the end. Of course [they]_p16 lived at 14 [their house number on [their]_p17 street], and until [Wendy]_n4 came [her]_p19 mother was the chief one. [She]_p20 was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.",5,,20,
barrie_testing," [Her]_p21 romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling [East]_n5 , however many [you]_p22 discover there is always one more and [her]_p23 sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on [it]_p24 that [Wendy]_n6 could never get, though there [it]_p25 was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner. The way [Mr Darling]_n7 won [her]_p26 was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when [she]_p31 was a girl discovered simultaneously that [they]_p32 loved her, and [they]_p33 all ran to [her]_p27 house to propose to [her]_p27 except [Mr Darling]_n8 , who took a cab and nipped in first, and so [he]_p34 got her. [He]_p35 got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. [He]_p36 never knew about the box, and in time [he]_p37 gave up trying for the kiss. [Wendy]_n9 thought [Napoleon]_n10 could have got it, but [I]_p38 can picture [him]_p39 trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door. [Mr Darling]_n11 used to boast to [Wendy]_n12 that [her]_p40 mother not only loved [him]_p41 but respected him. [He]_p43 was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but [he]_p44 quite seemed to know, and [he]_p45 often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him. [Mrs Darling]_n13 was married in white, and at first [she]_p46 kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if [it]_p47 were a game, not so much as a [Brussels]_n14 sprout was missing but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of [them]_p48 there were pictures of babies without faces. [She]_p49 drew [them]_p50 when [she]_p51 should have been totting up.",10,,28,
barrie_testing," [They]_p52 were [Mrs Darling]_n15 's guesses. [Wendy]_n16 came first, then [John]_n17 , then [Michael]_n18. For a week or two after [Wendy]_n19 came [it]_p53 was doubtful whether [they]_p54 would be able to keep her, as [she]_p55 was another mouth to feed. [Mr Darling]_n20 was frightfully proud of her, but [he]_p58 was very honourable, and [he]_p59 sat on the edge of [Mrs Darling]_n21 's bed, holding [her]_p56 hand and calculating expenses, while [she]_p60 looked at [him]_p61 imploringly. [She]_p62 wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not [his]_p63 way [his]_p64 way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if [she]_p65 confused [him]_p66 with suggestions [he]_p67 had to begin at the beginning again. ""Now don't interrupt,"". [he]_p68 would beg of her. ""[I]_p69 have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office [I]_p70 can cut off [my]_p73 coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with [your]_p76 eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in [my]_p74 cheque-book makes eight nine seven, who is that moving?, eight nine seven, dot and carry seven, don't speak, [my]_p74 own, and the pound [you]_p77 lent to that man who came to the door, quiet, child, dot and carry child, there, you've done it!, did [I]_p70 say nine nine seven? yes, [I]_p71 said nine nine seven the question is, can [we]_p81 try [it]_p79 for a year on nine nine seven?. ""Of course [we]_p82 can, [George]_n22 ,"". [she]_p83 cried.",8,,29,
barrie_testing," But [she]_p84 was prejudiced in [Wendy]_n23 's favour, and [he]_p85 was really the grander character of the two. ""Remember mumps,"". [he]_p86 warned [her]_p88 almost threateningly, and off [he]_p87 went again. ""Mumps one pound, that is what [I]_p89 have put down, but [I]_p90 daresay [it]_p91 will be more like thirty shillings, don't speak, measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six, don't waggle [your]_p94 finger, whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings , and so on [it]_p92 went, and [it]_p92 added up differently each time but at last [Wendy]_n24 just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one. There was the same excitement over [John]_n25 , and [Michael]_n26 had even a narrower squeak but both were kept, and soon, [you]_p95 might have seen the three of [them]_p96 going in a row to [Miss Fulsom]_n27 's [Kindergarten]_n28 school, accompanied by [their]_p97 nurse. As [you]_p98 look at [Wendy]_n29 , [you]_p99 may see [her]_p100 hair becoming white, and [her]_p101 figure little again, for all this happened long ago. [Jane]_n30 is now a common grown-up, with a daughter called [Margaret]_n31 and every spring cleaning time, except when [he]_p102 forgets, [Peter]_n32 comes for [Margaret]_n33 and takes [her]_p104 to the [Neverland]_n34 , where [she]_p105 tells [him]_p106 stories about himself, to which [he]_p103 listens eagerly. When [Margaret]_n35 grows up [she]_p107 will have a daughter, who is to be [Peter]_n36 's mother in turn and thus [it]_p108 will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.",14,,25,
