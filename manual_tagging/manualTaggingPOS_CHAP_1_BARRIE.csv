chap_1_barrie,"Chapter 1 [PETER]_n0 BREAKS THROUGH  All children, except one, grow up. [They]_p0 soon know that [they]_p1 will grow up, and the way [Wendy]_n1 knew was this. One day when [she]_p2 was two years old [she]_p3 was playing in a garden, and [she]_p3 plucked another flower and ran with [it]_p5 to [her]_p6 mother. [I]_p7 suppose [she]_p8 must have looked rather delightful, for [Mrs Darling]_n2 put [her]_p9 hand to [her]_p10 heart and cried,. ""Oh, why can't [you]_p11 remain like this for ever!"". This was all that passed between [them]_p12 on the subject, but henceforth [Wendy]_n3 knew that [she]_p13 must grow up.",4,,14,
chap_1_barrie," [You]_p14 always know after [you]_p15 are two. Two is the beginning of the end. Of course [they]_p16 lived at 14 [their house number on [their]_p17 street], and until [Wendy]_n4 came [her]_p19 mother was the chief one. [She]_p20 was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. [Her]_p21 romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling [East]_n5, however many [you]_p22 discover there is always one more and [her]_p23 sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on [it]_p24 that [Wendy]_n6 could never get, though there [it]_p25 was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner. The way [Mr Darling]_n7 won [her]_p26 was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when [she]_p31 was a girl discovered simultaneously that [they]_p32 loved her, and [they]_p33 all ran to [her]_p27 house to propose to [her]_p27 except Mr Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so [he]_p34 got her.",4,,18,
chap_1_barrie," [He]_p35 got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. [He]_p36 never knew about the box, and in time [he]_p37 gave up trying for the kiss. [Wendy]_n8 thought [Napoleon]_n9 could have got it, but [I]_p38 can picture [him]_p39 trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door. [Mr Darling]_n10 used to boast to [Wendy]_n11 that [her]_p40 mother not only loved [him]_p41 but respected him. [He]_p43 was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but [he]_p44 quite seemed to know, and [he]_p45 often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.",4,,10,
chap_1_barrie," [Mrs Darling]_n12 was married in white, and at first [she]_p46 kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if [it]_p47 were a game, not so much as a [Brussels]_n13 sprout was missing but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of [them]_p48 there were pictures of babies without faces. [She]_p49 drew [them]_p50 when [she]_p51 should have been totting up. [They]_p52 were [Mrs Darling]_n14's guesses. [Wendy]_n15 came first, then [John]_n16, then [Michael]_n17. For a week or two after [Wendy]_n18 came [it]_p53 was doubtful whether [they]_p54 would be able to keep her, as [she]_p55 was another mouth to feed. [Mr Darling]_n19 was frightfully proud of her, but [he]_p58 was very honourable, and [he]_p59 sat on the edge of [Mrs Darling]_n20's bed, holding [her]_p56 hand and calculating expenses, while [she]_p60 looked at [him]_p61 imploringly.",9,,15,
chap_1_barrie," [She]_p62 wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not [his]_p63 way [his]_p64 way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if [she]_p65 confused [him]_p66 with suggestions [he]_p67 had to begin at the beginning again. ""Now don't interrupt,"". [he]_p68 would beg of her. ""I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office [I]_p69 can cut off [my]_p73 coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with [your]_p76 eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in [my]_p74 cheque-book makes eight nine seven, who is that moving?, eight nine seven, dot and carry seven, don't speak, [my]_p74 own, and the pound [you]_p77 lent to that man who came to the door, quiet, child, dot and carry child, there, you've done it!, did [I]_p70 say nine nine seven? yes, [I]_p70 said nine nine seven the question is, can [we]_p81 try [it]_p79 for a year on nine nine seven?. ""Of course [we]_p82 can, [George]_n21,"". [she]_p83 cried.",1,,19,
chap_1_barrie," But [she]_p84 was prejudiced in [Wendy]_n22's favour, and [he]_p85 was really the grander character of the two. ""Remember mumps,"". [he]_p86 warned [her]_p88 almost threateningly, and off [he]_p87 went again. ""Mumps one pound, that is what [I]_p89 have put down, but [I]_p90 daresay [it]_p91 will be more like thirty shillings, don't speak, measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six, don't waggle [your]_p94 finger, whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings , and so on [it]_p92 went, and [it]_p92 added up differently each time but at last [Wendy]_n23 just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one. There was the same excitement over [John]_n24, and [Michael]_n25 had even a narrower squeak but both were kept, and soon, [you]_p95 might have seen the three of [them]_p96 going in a row to [Miss Fulsom]_n26's [Kindergarten]_n27 school, accompanied by [their]_p97 nurse. [Mrs Darling]_n28 loved to have everything just so, and [Mr Darling]_n29 had a passion for being exactly like [his]_p98 neighbours so, of course, [they]_p99 had a nurse.",8,,16,
chap_1_barrie," As [they]_p100 were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called [Nana]_n30, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. [She]_p101 had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with [her]_p102 in [Kensington Gardens]_n31, where [she]_p104 spent most of [her]_p103 spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom [she]_p105 followed to [their]_p106 homes and complained of to [their]_p107 mistresses. [She]_p108 proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough [she]_p109 was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of [her]_p110 charges made the slightest cry. Of course [her]_p111 kennel was in the nursery. [She]_p112 had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when [it]_p113 needs stocking around [your]_p114 throat.",2,,15,
chap_1_barrie," [She]_p115 believed to [her]_p116 last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. [It]_p117 was a lesson in propriety to see [her]_p118 escorting the children to school, walking sedately by [their]_p119 side when [they]_p120 were well behaved, and butting [them]_p122 back into line if [they]_p121 strayed. On [John]_n32's footer [in [England]_n33 soccer was called football,. ""footer"". for short] days [she]_p123 never once forgot [his]_p125 sweater, and [she]_p124 usually carried an umbrella in [her]_p126 mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of [Miss Fulsom]_n34's school where the nurses wait.",3,,12,
chap_1_barrie," [They]_p127 sat on forms, while [Nana]_n35 lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. [They]_p128 affected to ignore [her]_p129 as of an inferior social status to themselves, and [she]_p130 despised [their]_p131 light talk. [She]_p132 resented visits to the nursery from [Mrs Darling]_n36's friends, but if [they]_p133 did come [she]_p134 first whipped off [Michael]_n37's pinafore and put [him]_p135 into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out [Wendy]_n38 and made a dash at [John]_n39's hair. No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and [Mr Darling]_n40 knew it, yet [he]_p136 sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked. [He]_p137 had [his]_p138 position in the city to consider. [Nana]_n41 also troubled [him]_p139 in another way.",7,,13,
chap_1_barrie," [He]_p140 had sometimes a feeling that [she]_p141 did not admire him. ""I know [she]_p142 admires [you]_p144 tremendously, [George]_n42,  [Mrs Darling]_n43 would assure him, and then [she]_p143 would sign to the children to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, [Liza]_n44, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget [she]_p145 looked in [her]_p148 long skirt and maid's cap, though [she]_p146 had sworn, when engaged, that [she]_p146 would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was [Mrs Darling]_n45, who would pirouette so wildly that all [you]_p149 could see of [her]_p152 was the kiss, and then if [you]_p150 had dashed at [her]_p153 [you]_p150 might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of [Peter Pan]_n46.",5,,14,
chap_1_barrie," [Mrs Darling]_n47 first heard of [Peter]_n48 when [she]_p154 was tidying up [her]_p155 children's minds. [It]_p156 is the nightly custom of every good mother after [her]_p157 children are asleep to rummage in [their]_p158 minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into [their]_p159 proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. If [you]_p160 could keep awake (but of course [you]_p161 can't) [you]_p161 would see [your]_p164 own mother doing this, and [you]_p162 would find [it]_p165 very interesting to watch her. [It]_p166 is quite like tidying up drawers. [You]_p167 would see [her]_p168 on [her]_p169 knees, [I]_p171 expect, lingering humorously over some of [your]_p172 contents, wondering where on earth [you]_p173 had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to [her]_p169 cheek as if [it]_p174 were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When [you]_p175 wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which [you]_p176 went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of [your]_p178 mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out [your]_p179 prettier thoughts, ready for [you]_p176 to put on.",2,,26,
chap_1_barrie," [I]_p180 don't know whether [you]_p181 have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and [your]_p182 own map can become intensely interesting, but catch [them]_p183 trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like [your]_p184 temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the [Neverland]_n49 is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. [It]_p185 would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out [your]_p186 tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or [they]_p187 are another map showing through, and [it]_p188 is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still. Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. [John]_n50's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over [it]_p189 at which John was shooting, while [Michael]_n51, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.",3,,10,
chap_1_barrie," [John]_n52 lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, [Michael]_n53 in a wigwam, [Wendy]_n54 in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. [John]_n55 had no friends, [Michael]_n56 had friends at night, [Wendy]_n57 had a pet wolf forsaken by [its]_p191 parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if [they]_p192 stood still in a row [you]_p194 could say of [them]_p195 that [they]_p193 have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching [their]_p196 coracles [simple boat]. [We]_p197 too have been there [we]_p198 can still hear the sound of the surf, though [we]_p199 shall land no more. Of all delectable islands the [Neverland]_n58 is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, [you]_p200 know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When [you]_p201 play at [it]_p203 by day with the chairs and table-cloth, [it]_p204 is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before [you]_p202 go to sleep [it]_p204 becomes very real.",7,,15,
chap_1_barrie," That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in [her]_p206 travels through [her]_p207 children's minds [Mrs Darling]_n59 found things [she]_p208 could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word [Peter]_n60. [She]_p209 knew of no [Peter]_n61, and yet [he]_p210 was here and there in [John]_n62 and [Michael]_n63's minds, while [Wendy]_n64's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as [Mrs Darling]_n65 gazed [she]_p211 felt that [it]_p212 had an oddly cocky appearance. ""Yes, [he]_p213 is rather cocky,"". [Wendy]_n66 admitted with regret.",8,,8,
chap_1_barrie," [Her]_p214 mother had been questioning her. ""But who is he, [my]_p215 pet?. ""He is [Peter Pan]_n67, [you]_p216 know, mother.",1,,3,
