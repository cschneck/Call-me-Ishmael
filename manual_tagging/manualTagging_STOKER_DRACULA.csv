stoker_dracula,"CHAPTER [I]_p0 [JONATHAN HARKER]_n'S0 JOURNAL 3 [May]_n1. [Bistritz]_n2. , [Left Munich]_n3 at 8:35 P. M. , on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which [I]_p1 got of [it]_p3 from the train and the little [I]_p2 could walk through the streets. [I]_p4 feared to go very far from the station, as [we]_p5 had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression [I]_p6 had was that [we]_p7 were leaving the West and entering the [East]_n4 the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took [us]_p8 among the traditions of Turkish rule. [We]_p9 left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here [I]_p10 stopped for the night at the [Hotel Royale]_n5.",6,,11,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p11 had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. ([Mem]_n6. , get recipe for [Mina]_n7. ) [I]_p12 asked the waiter, and [he]_p14 said [it]_p15 was called ""paprika hendl,"" and that, as [it]_p16 was a national dish, [I]_p13 should be able to get [it]_p16 anywhere along the Carpathians. [I]_p18 found [my]_p21 smattering of German very useful here indeed, [I]_p19 don't know how [I]_p19 should be able to get on without it. Having had some time at [my]_p22 disposal when in London, [I]_p23 had visited the [British]_n8 Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding [Transylvania]_n9 [it]_p24 had struck [me]_p25 that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. [I]_p26 find that the district [he]_p27 named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, [Transylvania]_n,10 Moldavia and [Bukovina]_n,11 in the midst of the Carpathian mountains one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. [I]_p28 was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with [our]_p30 own Ordnance Survey maps but [I]_p29 found that Bistritz, the post town named by [Count Dracula]_n,12 is a fairly well-known place. [I]_p31 shall enter here some of [my]_p33 notes, as [they]_p36 may refresh [my]_p34 memory when [I]_p32 talk over [my]_p34 travels with Mina. In the population of [Transylvania]_n13 there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with [them]_p37 the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the [East]_n14 and North.",9,,27,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p38 am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century [they]_p39 found the Huns settled in it. [I]_p40 read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if [it]_p41 were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool if so [my]_p42 stay may be very interesting. ([Mem]_n15. , [I]_p43 must ask the Count all about them. )  [I]_p44 did not sleep well, though [my]_p46 bed was comfortable enough, for [I]_p45 had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under [my]_p47 window, which may have had something to do with [it]_p49 or [it]_p50 may have been the paprika, for [I]_p51 had to drink up all the water in [my]_p48 carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning [I]_p52 slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at [my]_p55 door, so [I]_p53 guess [I]_p53 must have been sleeping soundly then. [I]_p56 had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which [they]_p57 said was ""mamaliga,"" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which [they]_p58 call ""impletata. "" ([Mem]_n16.",2,,21,
stoker_dracula," , get recipe for this also. ) [I]_p59 had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather [it]_p61 ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 [I]_p60 had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before [we]_p62 began to move. [It]_p63 seems to [me]_p64 that the further east [you]_p65 go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought [they]_p66 to be in [China]_n?17 All day long [we]_p67 seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes [we]_p68 saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as [we]_p69 see in old missals sometimes [we]_p69 ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of [them]_p71 to be subject to great floods. [It]_p72 takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of [them]_p73 were just like the peasants at home or those [I]_p74 saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty, except when [you]_p75 got near them, but [they]_p76 were very clumsy about the waist. [They]_p77 had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of [them]_p78 had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from [them]_p79 like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them.",1,,21,
stoker_dracula," The strangest figures [we]_p81 saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with [their]_p82 big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails. [They]_p83 wore high boots, with [their]_p84 trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. [They]_p85 are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage [they]_p86 would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. [They]_p87 are, however, [I]_p88 am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion. [It]_p89 was on the dark side of twilight when [we]_p90 got to [Bistritz]_n,18 which is a very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier, for the [Borgo Pass]_n19 leads from [it]_p91 into [Bukovina]_n,20 [it]_p92 has had a very stormy existence, and [it]_p92 certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century [it]_p95 underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease. [Count Dracula]_n21 had directed [me]_p96 to go to the [Golden Krone Hotel]_n,22 which [I]_p97 found, to [my]_p100 great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course [I]_p98 wanted to see all [I]_p98 could of the ways of the country.",5,,19,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p101 was evidently expected, for when [I]_p102 got near the door [I]_p102 faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress, white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When [I]_p104 came close [she]_p106 bowed and said, ""The Herr Englishman?"" ""Yes,"" [I]_p105 said, ""Jonathan Harker. "" [She]_p107 smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed [her]_p108 to the door. [He]_p109 went, but immediately returned with a letter:,   ""My Friend. , Welcome to the Carpathians. [I]_p110 am anxiously expecting you. Sleep well [to-night]_n23. At three to-morrow the diligence will start for [Bukovina]_n24 a place on [it]_p111 is kept for you. At the [Borgo Pass]_n25 [my]_p112 carriage will await [you]_p113 and will bring [you]_p114 to me. [I]_p115 trust that [your]_p116 journey from London has been a happy one, and that [you]_p118 will enjoy [your]_p117 stay in [my]_p119 beautiful land.",3,,19,
stoker_dracula," ""Your friend,  ""DRACULA. "" 4 [May]_n26. , [I]_p120 found that [my]_p121 landlord had got a letter from the Count, directing [him]_p123 to secure the best place on the coach for [me]_p124 but on making inquiries as to details [he]_p125 seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that [he]_p126 could not understand [my]_p122 German. This could not be true, because up to then [he]_p127 had understood [it]_p130 perfectly at least, [he]_p128 answered [my]_p131 questions exactly as if [he]_p128 did. [He]_p132 and [his]_p133 wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way. [He]_p134 mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all [he]_p135 knew. When [I]_p136 asked [him]_p137 if [he]_p138 knew [Count Dracula]_n,27 and could tell [me]_p140 anything of [his]_p141 castle, both [he]_p139 and [his]_p142 wife crossed themselves, and, saying that [they]_p143 knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further. [It]_p144 was so near the time of starting that [I]_p145 had no time to ask any one else, for [it]_p146 was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting. Just before [I]_p147 was leaving, the old lady came up to [my]_p149 room and said in a very hysterical way: ""Must [you]_p150 go? Oh! [young Herr]_n,28 must [you]_p151 go?"" [She]_p152 was in such an excited state that [she]_p153 seemed to have lost [her]_p155 grip of what German [she]_p154 knew, and mixed [it]_p156 all up with some other language which [I]_p148 did not know at all. [I]_p157 was just able to follow [her]_p158 by asking many questions.",3,,39,
stoker_dracula," When [I]_p159 told [her]_p163 that [I]_p160 must go at once, and that [I]_p160 was engaged on important business, [she]_p164 asked again:  ""Do [you]_p165 know what day [it]_p166 is?"" [I]_p161 answered that [it]_p167 was the fourth of May. [She]_p168 shook [her]_p169 head as [she]_p170 said again: ""Oh, yes! [I]_p172 know that! [I]_p173 know that, but do [you]_p175 know what day [it]_p176 is?"" On [my]_p177 saying that [I]_p173 did not understand, [she]_p171 went on: ""It is the eve of [St]_n29. [George]_n's30 [Day]_n31. Do [you]_p178 not know that [to-night]_n,32 when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway? Do [you]_p179 know where [you]_p179 are going, and what [you]_p180 are going to?"" [She]_p182 was in such evident distress that [I]_p183 tried to comfort her, but without effect. Finally [she]_p184 went down on [her]_p185 knees and implored [me]_p186 not to go at least to wait a day or two before starting. [It]_p187 was all very ridiculous but [I]_p188 did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and [I]_p189 could allow nothing to interfere with it. [I]_p190 therefore tried to raise [her]_p194 up, and said, as gravely as [I]_p191 could, that [I]_p191 thanked her, but [my]_p196 duty was imperative, and that [I]_p192 must go. [She]_p197 then rose and dried [her]_p198 eyes, and taking a crucifix from [her]_p199 neck offered [it]_p200 to me. [I]_p201 did not know what to do, for, as an [English Churchman]_n,33 [I]_p202 have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet [it]_p203 seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind.",5,,44,
stoker_dracula," [She]_p204 saw, [I]_p205 suppose, the doubt in [my]_p206 face, for [she]_p208 put the rosary round [my]_p207 neck, and said, ""For [your]_p209 mother's sake,"" and went out of the room. [I]_p210 am writing up this part of the diary whilst [I]_p211 am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late and the crucifix is still round [my]_p212 neck. Whether [it]_p213 is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, [I]_p214 do not know, but [I]_p215 am not feeling nearly as easy in [my]_p216 mind as usual. If this book should ever reach [Mina]_n34 before [I]_p217 do, let [it]_p218 bring [my]_p219 good-bye. Here comes the coach! * * * * * 5 [May]_n35. The [Castle]_n36. , The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills [I]_p220 know not, for [it]_p221 is so far off that big things and little are mixed. [I]_p222 am not sleepy, and, as [I]_p223 am not to be called till [I]_p223 awake, naturally [I]_p224 write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads [them]_p226 may fancy that [I]_p227 dined too well before [I]_p228 left [Bistritz]_n,37 let [me]_p229 put down [my]_p230 dinner exactly. [I]_p231 dined on what [they]_p232 called ""robber steak"", bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable.",4,,29,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p233 had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else. When [I]_p234 got on the coach the driver had not taken [his]_p236 seat, and [I]_p235 saw [him]_p237 talking with the landlady. [They]_p238 were evidently talking of me, for every now and then [they]_p239 looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door, which [they]_p240 call by a name meaning ""word-bearer"", came and listened, and then looked at me, most of [them]_p241 pityingly. [I]_p242 could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd so [I]_p243 quietly got [my]_p244 polyglot dictionary from [my]_p245 bag and looked [them]_p246 out. [I]_p247 must say [they]_p248 were not cheering to me, for amongst [them]_p249 were ""Ordog"", Satan, ""pokol"", hell, ""stregoica"", witch, ""vrolok"" and ""vlkoslak"", both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire. ([Mem]_n38. , [I]_p250 must ask the Count about these superstitions)  When [we]_p251 started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty [I]_p252 got a fellow-passenger to tell [me]_p254 what [they]_p255 meant [he]_p256 would not answer at first, but on learning that [I]_p253 was [English]_n,39 [he]_p257 explained that [it]_p258 was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that [I]_p259 could not but be touched. [I]_p260 shall never forget the last glimpse which [I]_p261 had of the inn-yard and [its]_p262 crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as [they]_p264 stood round the wide archway, with [its]_p263 background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard.",2,,32,
stoker_dracula," Then [our]_p265 driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat, ""gotza"" [they]_p267 call them, cracked [his]_p268 big whip over [his]_p269 four small horses, which ran abreast, and [we]_p270 set off on [our]_p266 journey. [I]_p271 soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as [we]_p274 drove along, although had [I]_p272 known the language, or rather languages, which [my]_p275 fellow-passengers were speaking, [I]_p272 might not have been able to throw [them]_p276 off so easily. Before [us]_p277 lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom, apple, plum, pear, cherry and as [we]_p278 drove by [I]_p279 could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what [they]_p280 call here the ""Mittel [Land]_n""40 ran the road, losing [itself]_p281 as [it]_p282 swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still [we]_p283 seemed to fly over [it]_p284 with a feverish haste. [I]_p285 could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching [Borgo Prund]_n41. [I]_p286 was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that [it]_p287 had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect [it]_p288 is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for [it]_p289 is an old tradition that [they]_p290 are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that [they]_p291 were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.",2,,27,
stoker_dracula," Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel [Land]_n42 rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of [us]_p292 [they]_p293 towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon [them]_p294 and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were [themselves]_p295 lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, [we]_p296 saw now and again the white gleam of falling water. One of [my]_p297 companions touched [my]_p298 arm as [we]_p299 swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as [we]_p300 wound on [our]_p301 serpentine way, to be right before us:,   ""Look! Isten szek!"", ""God's seat!"", and [he]_p302 crossed [himself]_p303 reverently. As [we]_p304 wound on [our]_p305 endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there [we]_p306 passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but [I]_p307 noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and as [we]_p308 swept by, [my]_p309 companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as [we]_p310 approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, [their]_p311 white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves.",1,,20,
stoker_dracula," Now and again [we]_p312 passed a leiter-wagon, the ordinary peasant's cart, with [its]_p313 long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants, the Cszeks with [their]_p314 white, and the Slovaks with [their]_p315 coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion [their]_p315 long staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell [it]_p317 began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as [we]_p318 ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite [our]_p319 driver's haste, the horses could only go slowly. [I]_p320 wished to get down and walk up them, as [we]_p321 do at home, but the driver would not hear of it. ""No, no,"" [he]_p322 said ""you must not walk here the dogs are too fierce"" and then [he]_p323 added, with what [he]_p323 evidently meant for grim pleasantry, for [he]_p324 looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest, ""and [you]_p326 may have enough of such matters before [you]_p327 go to sleep. "" The only stop [he]_p329 would make was a moment's pause to light [his]_p330 lamps. When [it]_p331 grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and [they]_p332 kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging [him]_p333 to further speed. [He]_p335 lashed the horses unmercifully with [his]_p336 long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged [them]_p337 on to further exertions.",0,,24,
stoker_dracula," Then through the darkness [I]_p338 could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater the crazy coach rocked on [its]_p339 great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. [I]_p340 had to hold on. The road grew more level, and [we]_p341 appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to [us]_p342 on each side and to frown down upon [us]_p343 [we]_p344 were entering on the [Borgo Pass]_n43. One by one several of the passengers offered [me]_p345 gifts, which [they]_p347 pressed upon [me]_p346 with an earnestness which would take no denial these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which [I]_p348 had seen outside the hotel at [Bistritz]_n,44 the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as [we]_p349 flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. [It]_p350 was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though [I]_p351 asked each passenger, no one would give [me]_p352 the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time and at last [we]_p353 saw before [us]_p354 the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder.",2,,17,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p355 seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now [we]_p356 had got into the thunderous one. [I]_p357 was now [myself]_p358 looking out for the conveyance which was to take [me]_p359 to the Count. Each moment [I]_p360 expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of [our]_p361 own lamps, in which the steam from [our]_p362 hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. [We]_p363 could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on [it]_p364 no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock [my]_p365 own disappointment. [I]_p366 was already thinking what [I]_p367 had best do, when the driver, looking at [his]_p370 watch, said to the others something which [I]_p367 could hardly hear, [it]_p371 was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone [I]_p368 thought [it]_p372 was ""An hour less than the time. "" Then turning to me, [he]_p373 said in German worse than [my]_p374 own:,   ""There is no carriage here. The [Herr]_n45 is not expected after all. [He]_p375 will now come on to [Bukovina]_n,46 and return to-morrow or the next day better the next day.",2,,21,
stoker_dracula," "" Whilst [he]_p376 was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold [them]_p377 up. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a cal che, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. [I]_p378 could see from the flash of [our]_p379 lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. [They]_p380 were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide [his]_p381 face from us. [I]_p382 could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as [he]_p383 turned to us. [He]_p384 said to the driver:, ""You are early [to-night]_n,47 [my]_p385 friend. "" The man stammered in reply:, ""The [English Herr]_n48 was in a hurry,"" to which the stranger replied:, ""That is why, [I]_p386 suppose, [you]_p387 wished [him]_p388 to go on to [Bukovina]_n49. [You]_p389 cannot deceive me, [my]_p390 friend [I]_p392 know too much, and [my]_p391 horses are swift. "" As [he]_p393 spoke [he]_p394 smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of [my]_p395 companions whispered to another the line from Burger's ""Lenore"":, ""Denn die [Todten]_n50 reiten schnell"", (""For the dead travel fast.",4,,20,
stoker_dracula," "")  The strange driver evidently heard the words, for [he]_p396 looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned [his]_p397 face away, at the same time putting out [his]_p398 two fingers and crossing himself. ""Give [me]_p399 the [Herr]_n's51 luggage,"" said the driver and with exceeding alacrity [my]_p400 bags were handed out and put in the cal che. Then [I]_p401 descended from the side of the coach, as the cal che was close alongside, the driver helping [me]_p402 with a hand which caught [my]_p403 arm in a grip of steel [his]_p404 strength must have been prodigious. Without a word [he]_p405 shook [his]_p406 reins, the horses turned, and [we]_p407 swept into the darkness of the [Pass]_n52. As [I]_p408 looked back [I]_p409 saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against [it]_p410 the figures of [my]_p411 late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked [his]_p412 whip and called to [his]_p413 horses, and off [they]_p414 swept on [their]_p415 way to [Bukovina]_n53. As [they]_p416 sank into the darkness [I]_p417 felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over [me]_p418 but a cloak was thrown over [my]_p420 shoulders, and a rug across [my]_p421 knees, and the driver said in excellent German:,   ""The night is chill, mein Herr, and [my]_p421 master the Count bade [me]_p419 take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if [you]_p423 should require it. "" [I]_p424 did not take any, but [it]_p425 was a comfort to know [it]_p426 was there all the same.",3,,31,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p427 felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened. [I]_p428 think had there been any alternative [I]_p429 should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then [we]_p430 made a complete turn and went along another straight road. [It]_p431 seemed to [me]_p432 that [we]_p433 were simply going over and over the same ground again and so [I]_p434 took note of some salient point, and found that this was so. [I]_p435 would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but [I]_p436 really feared to do so, for [I]_p436 thought that, placed as [I]_p437 was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as [I]_p439 was curious to know how time was passing, [I]_p440 struck a match, and by [its]_p441 flame looked at [my]_p442 watch [it]_p443 was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave [me]_p444 a sort of shock, for [I]_p445 suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by [my]_p446 recent experiences. [I]_p447 waited with a sick feeling of suspense. Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road, a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp [it]_p448 through the gloom of the night.",0,,22,
stoker_dracula," At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to [them]_p449 soothingly, and [they]_p450 quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of [us]_p451 began a louder and a sharper howling, that of wolves, which affected both the horses and [myself]_p452 in the same way, for [I]_p453 was minded to jump from the cal che and run, whilst [they]_p454 reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all [his]_p455 great strength to keep [them]_p456 from bolting. In a few minutes, however, [my]_p457 own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. [He]_p458 petted and soothed them, and whispered something in [their]_p459 ears, as [I]_p460 have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under [his]_p461 caresses [they]_p462 became quite manageable again, though [they]_p463 still trembled. The driver again took [his]_p464 seat, and shaking [his]_p465 reins, started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, [he]_p466 suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right. Soon [we]_p467 were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till [we]_p468 passed as through a tunnel and again great frowning rocks guarded [us]_p469 boldly on either side. Though [we]_p470 were in shelter, [we]_p471 could hear the rising wind, for [it]_p473 moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as [we]_p471 swept along. [It]_p474 grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon [we]_p475 and all around [us]_p476 were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as [we]_p477 went on [our]_p478 way.",0,,30,
stoker_dracula," The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though [they]_p479 were closing round on [us]_p480 from every side. [I]_p481 grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared [my]_p482 fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed [he]_p483 kept turning [his]_p484 head to left and right, but [I]_p485 could not see anything through the darkness. Suddenly, away on [our]_p486 left, [I]_p487 saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw [it]_p488 at the same moment [he]_p489 at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. [I]_p490 did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer but while [I]_p491 wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took [his]_p492 seat, and [we]_p493 resumed [our]_p494 journey. [I]_p495 think [I]_p496 must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for [it]_p497 seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, [it]_p498 is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around [us]_p499 [I]_p500 could watch the driver's motions. [He]_p501 went rapidly to where the blue flame arose, [it]_p502 must have been very faint, for [it]_p503 did not seem to illumine the place around [it]_p503 at all, and gathering a few stones, formed [them]_p505 into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when [he]_p506 stood between [me]_p508 and the flame [he]_p507 did not obstruct it, for [I]_p509 could see [its]_p510 ghostly flicker all the same.",0,,32,
stoker_dracula," This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, [I]_p513 took [it]_p514 that [my]_p515 eyes deceived [me]_p511 straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and [we]_p516 sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though [they]_p517 were following in a moving circle. At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than [he]_p518 had yet gone, and during [his]_p519 absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright. [I]_p520 could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by [its]_p522 light [I]_p521 saw around [us]_p523 a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. [They]_p524 were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held [them]_p525 than even when [they]_p526 howled. For myself, [I]_p527 felt a sort of paralysis of fear. [It]_p528 is only when a man feels [himself]_p529 face to face with such horrors that [he]_p530 can understand [their]_p531 true import. All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see  but the living ring of terror encompassed [them]_p532 on every side and [they]_p533 had perforce to remain within it. [I]_p534 called to the coachman to come, for [it]_p535 seemed to [me]_p536 that [our]_p537 only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid [his]_p538 approach.",0,,27,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p539 shouted and beat the side of the cal che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give [him]_p540 a chance of reaching the trap. How [he]_p541 came there, [I]_p542 know not, but [I]_p543 heard [his]_p544 voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw [him]_p545 stand in the roadway. As [he]_p546 swept [his]_p547 long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that [we]_p548 were again in darkness. When [I]_p549 could see again the driver was climbing into the cal che, and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and [I]_p550 was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as [we]_p551 swept on [our]_p552 way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. [We]_p553 kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly, [I]_p554 became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky. CHAPTER II [JONATHAN HARKER]_n'S54 JOURNAL, continued 5 [May]_n55.",2,,16,
stoker_dracula," , [I]_p555 must have been asleep, for certainly if [I]_p556 had been fully awake [I]_p556 must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from [it]_p558 under great round arches, [it]_p559 perhaps seemed bigger than [it]_p559 really is. [I]_p561 have not yet been able to see [it]_p562 by daylight. When the cal che stopped, the driver jumped down and held out [his]_p563 hand to assist [me]_p564 to alight. Again [I]_p565 could not but notice [his]_p566 prodigious strength. [His]_p567 hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed [mine]_p568 if [he]_p569 had chosen. Then [he]_p570 took out [my]_p571 traps, and placed [them]_p572 on the ground beside [me]_p573 as [I]_p574 stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. [I]_p575 could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather. As [I]_p576 stood, the driver jumped again into [his]_p577 seat and shook the reins the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings. [I]_p578 stood in silence where [I]_p579 was, for [I]_p579 did not know what to do.",0,,26,
stoker_dracula," Of bell or knocker there was no sign through these frowning walls and dark window openings [it]_p581 was not likely that [my]_p582 voice could penetrate. The time [I]_p583 waited seemed endless, and [I]_p584 felt doubts and fears crowding upon me. What sort of place had [I]_p585 come to, and among what kind of people? What sort of grim adventure was [it]_p587 on which [I]_p586 had embarked? Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor, for just before leaving [London]_n56 [I]_p588 got word that [my]_p592 examination was successful and [I]_p589 am now a full-blown solicitor! [I]_p589 began to rub [my]_p593 eyes and pinch [myself]_p594 to see if [I]_p590 were awake. [It]_p595 all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and [I]_p596 expected that [I]_p597 should suddenly awake, and find [myself]_p599 at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as [I]_p597 had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork. But [my]_p600 flesh answered the pinching test, and [my]_p601 eyes were not to be deceived. [I]_p602 was indeed awake and among the Carpathians. All [I]_p603 could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of the morning. Just as [I]_p604 had come to this conclusion [I]_p605 heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back.",1,,25,
stoker_dracula," A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back. Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about [him]_p606 anywhere. [He]_p607 held in [his]_p608 hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long quivering shadows as [it]_p609 flickered in the draught of the open door. The old man motioned [me]_p610 in with [his]_p612 right hand with a courtly gesture, saying in excellent [English]_n,57 but with a strange intonation:, ""Welcome to [my]_p614 house! Enter freely and of [your]_p615 own will!"" [He]_p616 made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though [his]_p613 gesture of welcome had fixed [him]_p617 into stone. The instant, however, that [I]_p618 had stepped over the threshold, [he]_p619 moved impulsively forward, and holding out [his]_p620 hand grasped mine with a strength which made [me]_p621 wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that [it]_p622 seemed as cold as ice, more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again [he]_p623 said:,   ""Welcome to [my]_p624 house. Come freely. Go safely and leave something of the happiness [you]_p625 bring!"" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which [I]_p627 had noticed in the driver, whose face [I]_p628 had not seen, that for a moment [I]_p628 doubted if [it]_p634 were not the same person to whom [I]_p629 was speaking so to make sure, [I]_p629 said interrogatively:, ""[Count Dracula]_n?""58 [He]_p635 bowed in a courtly way as [he]_p636 replied:, ""I am Dracula and [I]_p629 bid [you]_p626 welcome, Mr Harker, to [my]_p637 house. Come in  the night air is chill, and [you]_p638 must need to eat and rest. "" As [he]_p639 was speaking, [he]_p640 put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, took [my]_p642 luggage [he]_p640 had carried [it]_p643 in before [I]_p644 could forestall him.",2,,37,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p645 protested but [he]_p646 insisted:, ""[Nay]_n,59 sir, [you]_p647 are [my]_p648 guest. [It]_p649 is late, and [my]_p650 people are not available. Let [me]_p651 see to [your]_p652 comfort myself. "" [He]_p653 insisted on carrying [my]_p654 traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor [our]_p655 steps rang heavily. At the end of this [he]_p656 threw open a heavy door, and [I]_p657 rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared. The Count halted, putting down [my]_p658 bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing through this, [he]_p659 opened another door, and motioned [me]_p660 to enter. [It]_p661 was a welcome sight for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire,, also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh, which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count [himself]_p662 left [my]_p663 luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before [he]_p664 closed the door:,   ""You will need, after [your]_p665 journey, to refresh [yourself]_p667 by making [your]_p666 toilet. [I]_p668 trust [you]_p669 will find all [you]_p670 wish.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," When [you]_p671 are ready, come into the other room, where [you]_p672 will find [your]_p673 supper prepared. ""  The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all [my]_p674 doubts and fears. Having then reached [my]_p675 normal state, [I]_p676 discovered that [I]_p677 was half famished with hunger so making a hasty toilet, [I]_p677 went into the other room. [I]_p679 found supper already laid out. [My]_p680 host, who stood on one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of [his]_p681 hand to the table, and said:,   ""I pray you, be seated and sup how [you]_p682 please. [You]_p684 will, [I]_p685 trust, excuse [me]_p689 that [I]_p686 do not join [you]_p690 but [I]_p686 have dined already, and [I]_p687 do not sup. ""  [I]_p691 handed to [him]_p692 the sealed letter which Mr Hawkins had entrusted to me. [He]_p693 opened [it]_p694 and read [it]_p695 gravely then, with a charming smile, [he]_p697 handed [it]_p695 to [me]_p698 to read. One passage of it, at least, gave [me]_p699 a thrill of pleasure. ""I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady [I]_p700 am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on [my]_p705 part for some time to come but [I]_p701 am happy to say [I]_p701 can send a sufficient substitute, one in whom [I]_p702 have every possible confidence.",0,,33,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p706 is a [young]_n60 man, full of energy and talent in [his]_p707 own way, and of a very faithful disposition. [He]_p708 is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in [my]_p709 service. [He]_p710 shall be ready to attend on [you]_p711 when [you]_p712 will during [his]_p713 stay, and shall take [your]_p714 instructions in all matters. ""  The Count [himself]_p715 came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and [I]_p716 fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which [I]_p717 had two glasses, was [my]_p718 supper. During the time [I]_p719 was eating [it]_p722 the Count asked [me]_p723 many questions as to [my]_p724 journey, and [I]_p720 told [him]_p725 by degrees all [I]_p720 had experienced. By this time [I]_p726 had finished [my]_p727 supper, and by [my]_p728 host's desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which [he]_p729 offered me, at the same time excusing [himself]_p731 that [he]_p730 did not smoke. [I]_p732 had now an opportunity of observing him, and found [him]_p733 of a very marked physiognomy. [His]_p735 face was a strong, a very strong, aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. [His]_p736 eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in [its]_p737 own profusion.",1,,31,
stoker_dracula," The mouth, so far as [I]_p738 could see [it]_p739 under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of [his]_p740 years. For the [rest]_n,61 [his]_p741 ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor. Hitherto [I]_p742 had noticed the backs of [his]_p744 hands as [they]_p746 lay on [his]_p745 knees in the firelight, and [they]_p747 had seemed rather white and fine but seeing [them]_p749 now close to me, [I]_p743 could not but notice that [they]_p747 were rather coarse, broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point. As the Count leaned over [me]_p750 and [his]_p752 hands touched me, [I]_p753 could not repress a shudder. [It]_p754 may have been that [his]_p755 breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what [I]_p756 would, [I]_p757 could not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than [he]_p758 had yet done [his]_p759 protuberant teeth, sat [himself]_p761 down again on [his]_p760 own side of the fireplace. [We]_p762 were both silent for a while and as [I]_p763 looked towards the window [I]_p764 saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," There seemed a strange stillness over everything but as [I]_p765 listened [I]_p766 heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes gleamed, and [he]_p767 said:,   ""Listen to them, the children of the night. What music [they]_p768 make!"" Seeing, [I]_p769 suppose, some expression in [my]_p770 face strange to him, [he]_p771 added:,   ""Ah, sir, [you]_p772 dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter. "" Then [he]_p773 rose and said:,   ""But [you]_p774 must be tired. [Your]_p775 bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow [you]_p776 shall sleep as late as [you]_p777 will. [I]_p778 have to be away till the afternoon  so sleep well and dream well!"" With a courteous bow, [he]_p780 opened for [me]_p781 [himself]_p782 the door to the octagonal room, and [I]_p779 entered [my]_p783 bedroom. [I]_p784 am all in a sea of wonders. [I]_p785 doubt [I]_p786 fear [I]_p786 think strange things, which [I]_p787 dare not confess to [my]_p789 own soul. God keep me, if only for the sake of those [dear]_n62 to me! * * * * * 7 May. , [It]_p790 is again early morning, but [I]_p791 have rested and enjoyed the last twenty-four hours.",1,,27,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p792 slept till late in the day, and awoke of [my]_p793 own accord. When [I]_p794 had dressed [myself]_p796 [I]_p795 went into the room where [we]_p797 had supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which was written:,   ""I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me. , D. "" [I]_p798 set to and enjoyed a hearty meal. When [I]_p799 had done, [I]_p800 looked for a bell, so that [I]_p800 might let the servants know [I]_p801 had finished but [I]_p801 could not find one. There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that [it]_p804 must be of immense value. The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of [my]_p805 bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when [they]_p806 were made, for [they]_p807 are centuries old, though in excellent order.",0,,16,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p808 saw something like [them]_p809 in [Hampton Court]_n,63 but there [they]_p810 were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on [my]_p811 table, and [I]_p814 had to get the little shaving glass from [my]_p812 bag before [I]_p815 could either shave or brush [my]_p812 hair. [I]_p816 have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves. Some time after [I]_p817 had finished [my]_p823 meal, [I]_p818 do not know whether to call [it]_p824 breakfast or dinner, for [it]_p825 was between five and six o'clock when [I]_p818 had it, [I]_p819 looked about for something to read, for [I]_p819 did not like to go about the castle until [I]_p819 had asked the Count's permission. There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing materials so [I]_p827 opened another door in the room and found a sort of library. The door opposite mine [I]_p828 tried, but found [it]_p829 locked. In the library [I]_p830 found, to [my]_p831 great delight, a vast number of [English]_n64 books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with [English]_n65 magazines and newspapers, though none of [them]_p832 were of very recent date. The books were of the most varied kind, history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law, all relating to England and [English]_n66 life and customs and manners.",4,,24,
stoker_dracula," There were even such books of reference as the London Directory, the ""[Red]_n""67 and ""Blue"" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the Army and [Navy Lists]_n,68 and, [it]_p833 somehow gladdened [my]_p835 heart to see it, the Law List. Whilst [I]_p836 was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered. [He]_p837 saluted [me]_p838 in a hearty way, and hoped that [I]_p839 had had a good night's [rest]_n69. Then [he]_p840 went on:,   ""I am glad [you]_p843 found [your]_p845 way in here, for [I]_p841 am sure there is much that will interest you. These companions"", and [he]_p846 laid [his]_p847 hand on some of the books, ""have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever since [I]_p850 had the idea of going to London, have given [me]_p848 many, many hours of pleasure. Through [them]_p851 [I]_p852 have come to know [your]_p853 great England and to know [her]_p854 is to love her. [I]_p856 long to go through the crowded streets of [your]_p857 mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share [its]_p858 life, [its]_p859 change, [its]_p859 death, and all that makes [it]_p861 what [it]_p862 is. But alas! as yet [I]_p863 only know [your]_p864 tongue through books. To you, [my]_p865 friend, [I]_p866 look that [I]_p867 know [it]_p868 to speak. ""  ""But, Count,"" [I]_p869 said, ""you know and speak English thoroughly!"" [He]_p870 bowed gravely.",3,,33,
stoker_dracula," ""I thank you, [my]_p875 friend, for [your]_p876 all too-flattering estimate, but yet [I]_p871 fear that [I]_p872 am but a little way on the road [I]_p872 would travel. True, [I]_p877 know the grammar and the words, but yet [I]_p878 know not how to speak them. ""  ""Indeed,"" [I]_p879 said, ""you speak excellently. ""  ""Not so,"" [he]_p880 answered. ""Well, [I]_p881 know that, did [I]_p882 move and speak in [your]_p883 [London]_n,70 none there are who would not know [me]_p884 for a stranger. That is not enough for me. Here [I]_p885 am noble [I]_p886 am boyar the common people know me, and [I]_p886 am master. But a stranger in a strange land, [he]_p888 is no one men know [him]_p889 not, and to know not is to care not for. [I]_p890 am content if [I]_p891 am like the rest, so that no man stops if [he]_p894 see me, or pause in [his]_p896 speaking if [he]_p895 hear [my]_p897 words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' [I]_p891 have been so long master that [I]_p892 would be master still, or at least that none other should be master of me. [You]_p898 come to [me]_p899 not alone as agent of [my]_p901 friend Peter Hawkins, of [Exeter]_n,71 to tell [me]_p900 all about [my]_p902 new estate in London.",2,,31,
stoker_dracula," [You]_p903 shall, [I]_p904 trust, rest here with [me]_p908 awhile, so that by [our]_p910 talking [I]_p905 may learn the [English]_n72 intonation and [I]_p905 would that [you]_p911 tell [me]_p909 when [I]_p906 make error, even of the smallest, in [my]_p912 speaking. [I]_p913 am sorry that [I]_p914 had to be away so long to-day but [you]_p916 will, [I]_p914 know, forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand. ""  Of course [I]_p917 said all [I]_p918 could about being willing, and asked if [I]_p918 might come into that room when [I]_p919 chose. [He]_p921 answered: ""Yes, certainly,"" and added:,   ""You may go anywhere [you]_p922 wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course [you]_p923 will not wish to go. There is reason that all things are as [they]_p924 are, and did [you]_p925 see with [my]_p927 eyes and know with [my]_p928 knowledge, [you]_p926 would perhaps better understand. "" [I]_p929 said [I]_p930 was sure of this, and then [he]_p931 went on:, ""We are in [Transylvania]_n73 and [Transylvania]_n74 is not England. [Our]_p932 ways are not [your]_p933 ways, and there shall be to [you]_p934 many strange things. Nay, from what [you]_p935 have told [me]_p937 of [your]_p938 experiences already, [you]_p936 know something of what strange things there may be. ""  This led to much conversation and as [it]_p939 was evident that [he]_p940 wanted to talk, if only for talking's sake, [I]_p941 asked [him]_p942 many questions regarding things that had already happened to [me]_p943 or come within [my]_p944 notice. Sometimes [he]_p945 sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand but generally [he]_p946 answered all [I]_p947 asked most frankly.",3,,45,
stoker_dracula," Then as time went on, and [I]_p948 had got somewhat bolder, [I]_p949 asked [him]_p950 of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where [he]_p951 had seen the blue flames. [He]_p952 then explained to [me]_p953 that [it]_p954 was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year, last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway, a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed. ""That treasure has been hidden,"" [he]_p955 went on, ""in the region through which [you]_p956 came last night, there can be but little doubt for [it]_p957 was the ground fought over for centuries by the [Wallachian]_n,75 the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the [Hungarian]_n76 came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them, men and women, the aged and the children too, and waited [their]_p960 coming on the rocks above the passes, that [they]_p962 might sweep destruction on [them]_p958 with [their]_p961 artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant [he]_p963 found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil. ""  ""But how,"" said I, ""can [it]_p964 have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to [it]_p965 if men will but take the trouble to look?"" The Count smiled, and as [his]_p967 lips ran back over [his]_p968 gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely [he]_p970 answered:,   ""Because [your]_p972 peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only appear on one night and on that night no man of this land will, if [he]_p971 can help it, stir without [his]_p968 doors. And, [dear]_n77 sir, even if [he]_p973 did [he]_p974 would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that [you]_p975 tell [me]_p976 of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for [his]_p977 own work. Even [you]_p978 would not, [I]_p980 dare be sworn, be able to find these places again?""  ""There [you]_p979 are right,"" [I]_p981 said.",3,,32,
stoker_dracula," ""I know no more than the dead where even to look for them. "" Then [we]_p982 drifted into other matters. ""Come,"" [he]_p983 said at last, ""tell [me]_p984 of London and of the house which [you]_p986 have procured for me. "" With an apology for [my]_p987 remissness, [I]_p990 went into [my]_p988 own room to get the papers from [my]_p988 bag. Whilst [I]_p991 was placing [them]_p994 in order [I]_p992 heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as [I]_p992 passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for [it]_p995 was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and [I]_p996 found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When [I]_p997 came in [he]_p999 cleared the books and papers from the table and with [him]_p1000 [I]_p998 went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. [He]_p1001 was interested in everything, and asked [me]_p1002 a myriad questions about the place and [its]_p1003 surroundings. [He]_p1004 clearly had studied beforehand all [he]_p1005 could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for [he]_p1006 evidently at the end knew very much more than [I]_p1007 did. When [I]_p1008 remarked this, [he]_p1013 answered:,   ""Well, but, [my]_p1014 friend, is [it]_p1019 not needful that [I]_p1009 should? When [I]_p1009 go there [I]_p1010 shall be all alone, and [my]_p1015 friend Harker Jonathan, nay, pardon me, [I]_p1010 fall into [my]_p1015 country's habit of putting [your]_p1020 patronymic first, [my]_p1016 friend Jonathan Harker will not be by [my]_p1016 side to correct and aid me.",0,,38,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p1021 will be in [Exeter]_n,78 miles away, probably working at papers of the law with [my]_p1022 other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!""  [We]_p1023 went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at Purfleet. When [I]_p1024 had told [him]_p1026 the facts and got [his]_p1027 signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with [them]_p1028 ready to post to Mr Hawkins, [he]_p1029 began to ask [me]_p1030 how [I]_p1025 had come across so suitable a place. [I]_p1031 read to [him]_p1035 the notes which [I]_p1032 had made at the time, and which [I]_p1032 inscribe here:,   ""At Purfleet, on a by-road, [I]_p1033 came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale. [It]_p1036 is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust. ""The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old [Quatre Face]_n,79 as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass. [It]_p1037 contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which make [it]_p1038 in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all periods back, [I]_p1040 should say, to medi val times, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron.",2,,19,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p1041 looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church. [I]_p1042 could not enter it, as [I]_p1043 had not the key of the door leading to [it]_p1045 from the house, but [I]_p1043 have taken with [my]_p1048 kodak views of [it]_p1046 from various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling way, and [I]_p1049 can only guess at the amount of ground [it]_p1050 covers, which must be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum. [It]_p1051 is not, however, visible from the grounds. ""  When [I]_p1052 had finished, [he]_p1054 said:,   ""I am glad that [it]_p1055 is old and big. [I]_p1056 [myself]_p1057 am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a day and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. [I]_p1058 rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times. [We]_p1059 Transylvanian nobles love not to think that [our]_p1060 bones may lie amongst the common dead.",0,,18,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p1061 seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the [young]_n80 and [gay]_n81. [I]_p1062 am no longer [young]_n82 and [my]_p1063 heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of [my]_p1064 castle are broken the shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements. [I]_p1065 love the shade and the shadow, and would be alone with [my]_p1067 thoughts when [I]_p1066 may. "" Somehow [his]_p1068 words and [his]_p1069 look did not seem to accord, or else [it]_p1072 was that [his]_p1069 cast of face made [his]_p1070 smile look malignant and saturnine. Presently, with an excuse, [he]_p1073 left me, asking [me]_p1074 to put all [my]_p1076 papers together. [He]_p1077 was some little time away, and [I]_p1078 began to look at some of the books around me. One was an atlas, which [I]_p1079 found opened naturally at England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at [it]_p1080 [I]_p1081 found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these [I]_p1082 noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where [his]_p1083 new estate was situated the other two were [Exeter]_n,83 and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast. [It]_p1084 was the better part of an hour when the Count returned.",4,,23,
stoker_dracula," ""Aha!"" [he]_p1085 said ""still at [your]_p1086 books? [Good]_n!84 But [you]_p1087 must not work always. Come [I]_p1088 am informed that [your]_p1089 supper is ready. "" [He]_p1090 took [my]_p1091 arm, and [we]_p1092 went into the next room, where [I]_p1093 found an excellent supper ready on the table. The Count again excused himself, as [he]_p1094 had dined out on [his]_p1095 being away from home. But [he]_p1096 sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst [I]_p1097 ate. After supper [I]_p1098 smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour. [I]_p1099 felt that [it]_p1102 was getting very late indeed, but [I]_p1100 did not say anything, for [I]_p1100 felt under obligation to meet [my]_p1103 host's wishes in every way. [I]_p1104 was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified [me]_p1106 but [I]_p1105 could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in [its]_p1107 way, the turn of the tide. [They]_p1108 say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide any one who has when tired, and tied as [it]_p1109 were to [his]_p1111 post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once [we]_p1112 heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air [Count Dracula]_n,85 jumping to [his]_p1113 feet, said:, ""Why, there is the morning again! How remiss [I]_p1114 am to let [you]_p1115 stay up so long.",2,,30,
stoker_dracula," [You]_p1116 must make [your]_p1117 conversation regarding [my]_p1118 [dear]_n86 new country of England less interesting, so that [I]_p1119 may not forget how time flies by us,"" and, with a courtly bow, [he]_p1120 quickly left me. [I]_p1121 went into [my]_p1123 own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice [my]_p1124 window opened into the courtyard, all [I]_p1122 could see was the warm grey of quickening sky. So [I]_p1125 pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day. * * * * * 8 [May]_n87. , [I]_p1126 began to fear as [I]_p1127 wrote in this book that [I]_p1127 was getting too diffuse but now [I]_p1128 am glad that [I]_p1128 went into detail from the first, for there is something so strange about this place and all in [it]_p1132 that [I]_p1128 cannot but feel uneasy. [I]_p1133 wish [I]_p1134 were safe out of it, or that [I]_p1134 had never come. [It]_p1136 may be that this strange night-existence is telling on [me]_p1137 but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to [I]_p1138 could bear it, but there is no one. [I]_p1139 have only the Count to speak with, and he!, [I]_p1140 fear [I]_p1140 am [myself]_p1142 the only living soul within the place. Let [me]_p1143 be prosaic so far as facts can be [it]_p1146 will help [me]_p1144 to bear up, and imagination must not run riot with me. If [it]_p1147 does [I]_p1148 am lost.",2,,32,
stoker_dracula," Let [me]_p1149 say at once how [I]_p1150 stand, or seem to. [I]_p1151 only slept a few hours when [I]_p1152 went to bed, and feeling that [I]_p1152 could not sleep any more, got up. [I]_p1154 had hung [my]_p1155 shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly [I]_p1156 felt a hand on [my]_p1157 shoulder, and heard the Count's voice saying to me, ""Good-morning. "" [I]_p1158 started, for [it]_p1160 amazed [me]_p1161 that [I]_p1159 had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me. In starting [I]_p1163 had cut [myself]_p1164 slightly, but did not notice [it]_p1165 at the moment. Having answered the Count's salutation, [I]_p1166 turned to the glass again to see how [I]_p1167 had been mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and [I]_p1168 could see [him]_p1169 over [my]_p1170 shoulder. But there was no reflection of [him]_p1171 in the mirror! The whole room behind [me]_p1172 was displayed but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which [I]_p1173 always have when the Count is near but at the instant [I]_p1174 saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over [my]_p1175 chin.",0,,26,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p1176 laid down the razor, turning as [I]_p1177 did so half round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw [my]_p1178 face, [his]_p1180 eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and [he]_p1181 suddenly made a grab at [my]_p1179 throat. [I]_p1182 drew away, and [his]_p1183 hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. [It]_p1184 made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that [I]_p1185 could hardly believe that [it]_p1186 was ever there. ""Take care,"" [he]_p1187 said, ""take care how [you]_p1188 cut yourself. [It]_p1189 is more dangerous than [you]_p1190 think in this country. "" Then seizing the shaving glass, [he]_p1191 went on: ""And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief. [It]_p1192 is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!"" and opening the heavy window with one wrench of [his]_p1193 terrible hand, [he]_p1194 flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below. Then [he]_p1195 withdrew without a word.",0,,20,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p1196 is very annoying, for [I]_p1197 do not see how [I]_p1198 am to shave, unless in [my]_p1199 watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal. When [I]_p1200 went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared but [I]_p1201 could not find the Count anywhere. So [I]_p1202 breakfasted alone. [It]_p1203 is strange that as yet [I]_p1204 have not seen the Count eat or drink. [He]_p1205 must be a very peculiar man! After breakfast [I]_p1206 did a little exploring in the castle. [I]_p1207 went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where [I]_p1208 stood there was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests.",0,,13,
stoker_dracula," But [I]_p1209 am not in heart to describe beauty, for when [I]_p1210 had seen the view [I]_p1210 explored further doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit. The castle is a veritable prison, and [I]_p1212 am a prisoner! CHAPTER III JONATHAN [HARKER]_n'S88 JOURNAL, continued When [I]_p1213 found that [I]_p1213 was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me. [I]_p1215 rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window [I]_p1216 could find but after a little the conviction of [my]_p1217 helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When [I]_p1218 look back after a few hours [I]_p1219 think [I]_p1219 must have been mad for the time, for [I]_p1220 behaved much as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to [me]_p1222 that [I]_p1223 was helpless [I]_p1224 sat down quietly, as quietly as [I]_p1224 have ever done anything in [my]_p1226 life, and began to think over what was best to be done. [I]_p1227 am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of one thing only am [I]_p1228 certain that [it]_p1229 is no use making [my]_p1230 ideas known to the Count. [He]_p1231 knows well that [I]_p1232 am imprisoned and as [he]_p1234 has done [it]_p1236 himself, and has doubtless [his]_p1238 own motives for it, [he]_p1235 would only deceive [me]_p1239 if [I]_p1233 trusted [him]_p1240 fully with the facts. So far as [I]_p1241 can see, [my]_p1242 only plan will be to keep [my]_p1243 knowledge and [my]_p1243 fears to myself, and [my]_p1244 eyes open.",1,,36,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p1246 am, [I]_p1247 know, either being deceived, like a baby, by [my]_p1250 own fears, or else [I]_p1247 am in desperate straits and if the latter be so, [I]_p1248 need, and shall need, all [my]_p1251 brains to get through. [I]_p1252 had hardly come to this conclusion when [I]_p1253 heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned. [He]_p1254 did not come at once into the library, so [I]_p1255 went cautiously to [my]_p1256 own room and found [him]_p1257 making the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what [I]_p1258 had all along thought, that there were no servants in the house. When later [I]_p1259 saw [him]_p1261 through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, [I]_p1260 was assured of [it]_p1262 for if [he]_p1264 does [himself]_p1265 all these menial offices, surely [it]_p1263 is proof that there is no one else to do them. This gave [me]_p1266 a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, [it]_p1268 must have been the Count [himself]_p1269 who was the driver of the coach that brought [me]_p1267 here. This is a terrible thought for if so, what does [it]_p1270 mean that [he]_p1271 could control the wolves, as [he]_p1272 did, by only holding up [his]_p1273 hand in silence. How was [it]_p1274 that all the people at [Bistritz]_n89 and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? [Bless]_n90 that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round [my]_p1279 neck! for [it]_p1275 is a comfort and a strength to [me]_p1277 whenever [I]_p1280 touch it. [It]_p1281 is odd that a thing which [I]_p1282 have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is [it]_p1283 that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that [it]_p1284 is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if [it]_p1284 may be, [I]_p1287 must examine this matter and try to make up [my]_p1288 mind about it.",2,,40,
stoker_dracula," In the meantime [I]_p1289 must find out all [I]_p1290 can about [Count Dracula]_n,91 as [it]_p1291 may help [me]_p1292 to understand. To-night [he]_p1293 may talk of himself, if [I]_p1294 turn the conversation that way. [I]_p1295 must be very careful, however, not to awake [his]_p1296 suspicion. * * * * *  Midnight. , [I]_p1297 have had a long talk with the Count. [I]_p1298 asked [him]_p1299 a few questions on [Transylvania]_n92 history, and [he]_p1300 warmed up to the subject wonderfully. In [his]_p1301 speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, [he]_p1302 spoke as if [he]_p1303 had been present at [them]_p1304 all. This [he]_p1305 afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of [his]_p1306 house and name is [his]_p1307 own pride, that [their]_p1310 glory is [his]_p1307 glory, that [their]_p1311 fate is [his]_p1308 fate. Whenever [he]_p1312 spoke of [his]_p1314 house [he]_p1313 always said ""we,"" and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. [I]_p1315 wish [I]_p1316 could put down all [he]_p1317 said exactly as [he]_p1318 said it, for to [me]_p1321 [it]_p1319 was most fascinating.",2,,32,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p1322 seemed to have in [it]_p1323 a whole history of the country. [He]_p1324 grew excited as [he]_p1325 spoke, and walked about the room pulling [his]_p1328 great white moustache and grasping anything on which [he]_p1326 laid [his]_p1329 hands as though [he]_p1326 would crush [it]_p1330 by main strength. One thing [he]_p1331 said which [I]_p1332 shall put down as nearly as [I]_p1333 can for [it]_p1334 tells in [its]_p1335 way the story of [his]_p1336 race:,   ""We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in [our]_p1337 veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which [their]_p1338 Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves [themselves]_p1339 had come. Here, too, when [they]_p1340 came, [they]_p1341 found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in [their]_p1342 veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?"" [He]_p1343 held up [his]_p1344 arms. ""Is [it]_p1345 a wonder that [we]_p1347 were a conquering race that [we]_p1348 were proud that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured [his]_p1350 thousands on [our]_p1352 frontiers, [we]_p1348 drove [them]_p1353 back? Is [it]_p1346 strange that when Arpad and [his]_p1351 legions swept through the [Hungarian]_n93 fatherland [he]_p1354 found [us]_p1356 here when [he]_p1355 reached the frontier that the Honfoglalas was completed there? And when the [Hungarian]_n94 flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to [us]_p1357 for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of [[Turkey]_n]_n-land95 ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, 'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless. ' Who more gladly than [we]_p1358 throughout the Four [Nations]_n96 received the 'bloody sword,' or at [its]_p1359 warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was redeemed that great shame of [my]_p1360 nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was [it]_p1362 but one of [my]_p1361 own race who as [Voivode]_n97 crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on [his]_p1365 own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was [it]_p1363 that [his]_p1366 own unworthy brother, when [he]_p1371 had fallen, sold [his]_p1366 people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was [it]_p1363 not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of [his]_p1367 race who in a later age again and again brought [his]_p1367 forces over the great river into [Turkey]_n-land98 who, when [he]_p1372 was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though [he]_p1372 had to come alone from the bloody field where [his]_p1367 troops were being slaughtered, since [he]_p1373 knew that [he]_p1373 alone could ultimately triumph! [They]_p1377 said that [he]_p1373 thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Moh cs, [we]_p1378 threw off the [Hungarian]_n99 yoke, [we]_p1379 of the Dracula blood were amongst [their]_p1381 leaders, for [our]_p1382 spirit would not brook that [we]_p1379 were not free. Ah, [young]_n100 sir, the Szekelys, and the [Dracula]_n101 as [their]_p1383 heart's blood, [their]_p1384 brains, and [their]_p1384 swords, can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach.",10,,64,
stoker_dracula," The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told. ""  [It]_p1386 was by this time close on morning, and [we]_p1387 went to bed. ([Mem]_n102. , this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the ""[Arabian Nights]_n,""103 for everything has to break off at cockcrow, or like the ghost of Hamlet's father. ) * * * * * 12 [May]_n104. , Let [me]_p1388 begin with facts, bare, meagre facts, verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. [I]_p1389 must not confuse [them]_p1390 with experiences which will have to rest on [my]_p1392 own observation, or [my]_p1393 memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from [his]_p1394 room [he]_p1395 began by asking [me]_p1396 questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business. [I]_p1397 had spent the day wearily over books, and, simply to keep [my]_p1399 mind occupied, went over some of the matters [I]_p1398 had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn.",3,,13,
stoker_dracula," There was a certain method in the Count's inquiries, so [I]_p1400 shall try to put [them]_p1401 down in sequence the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me. First, [he]_p1402 asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. [I]_p1403 told [him]_p1404 [he]_p1405 might have a dozen if [he]_p1406 wished, but that [it]_p1407 would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against [his]_p1408 interest. [He]_p1409 seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor. [I]_p1410 asked [him]_p1413 to explain more fully, so that [I]_p1411 might not by any chance mislead him, so [he]_p1415 said:,   ""I shall illustrate. [Your]_p1416 friend and mine, Mr Peter Hawkins, from under the shadow of [your]_p1417 beautiful cathedral at [Exeter]_n,105 which is far from London, buys for [me]_p1419 through [your]_p1418 good self [my]_p1420 place at London. Good! Now here let [me]_p1421 say frankly, lest [you]_p1422 should think [it]_p1423 strange that [I]_p1424 have sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one resident there, that [my]_p1426 motive was that no local interest might be served save [my]_p1427 wish only and as one of London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of [himself]_p1430 or friend to serve, [I]_p1425 went thus afield to seek [my]_p1427 agent, whose labours should be only to [my]_p1428 interest. Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or [Harwich]_n,106 or Dover, might [it]_p1433 not be that [it]_p1434 could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?"" [I]_p1431 answered that certainly [it]_p1434 would be most easy, but that [we]_p1436 solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing [himself]_p1437 in the hands of one man, could have [his]_p1438 wishes carried out by [him]_p1439 without further trouble. ""But,"" said he, ""I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is [it]_p1440 not so?""  ""Of course,"" [I]_p1441 replied and ""such is often done by men of business, who do not like the whole of [their]_p1442 affairs to be known by any one person.",2,,40,
stoker_dracula," ""  ""Good!"" [he]_p1443 said, and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against. [I]_p1444 explained all these things to [him]_p1445 to the best of [my]_p1446 ability, and [he]_p1447 certainly left [me]_p1450 under the impression that [he]_p1448 would have made a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that [he]_p1448 did not think of or foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, [his]_p1451 knowledge and acumen were wonderful. When [he]_p1452 had satisfied [himself]_p1455 on these points of which [he]_p1453 had spoken, and [I]_p1456 had verified all as well as [I]_p1457 could by the books available, [he]_p1453 suddenly stood up and said:,   ""Have [you]_p1461 written since [your]_p1462 first letter to [our]_p1463 friend Mr Peter Hawkins, or to any other?"" [It]_p1464 was with some bitterness in [my]_p1465 heart that [I]_p1457 answered that [I]_p1458 had not, that as yet [I]_p1458 had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody. ""Then write now, [my]_p1466 [young]_n107 friend,"" [he]_p1468 said, laying a heavy hand on [my]_p1467 shoulder: ""write to [our]_p1469 friend and to any other and say, if [it]_p1470 will please you, that [you]_p1471 shall stay with [me]_p1473 until a month from now. ""  ""Do [you]_p1474 wish [me]_p1475 to stay so long?"" [I]_p1476 asked, for [my]_p1477 heart grew cold at the thought. ""I desire [it]_p1480 much nay, [I]_p1478 will take no refusal. When [your]_p1481 master, employer, what [you]_p1482 will, engaged that someone should come on [his]_p1483 behalf, [it]_p1484 was understood that [my]_p1485 needs only were to be consulted. [I]_p1486 have not stinted. Is [it]_p1487 not so?"" What could [I]_p1489 do but bow acceptance? [It]_p1494 was Mr Hawkins's interest, not mine, and [I]_p1490 had to think of him, not [myself]_p1495 and besides, while [Count Dracula]_n108 was speaking, there was that in [his]_p1496 eyes and in [his]_p1497 bearing which made [me]_p1498 remember that [I]_p1490 was a prisoner, and that if [I]_p1491 wished [it]_p1488 [I]_p1491 could have no choice.",2,,54,
stoker_dracula," The Count saw [his]_p1499 victory in [my]_p1502 bow, and [his]_p1500 mastery in the trouble of [my]_p1503 face, for [he]_p1505 began at once to use them, but in [his]_p1500 own smooth, resistless way:, ""I pray you, [my]_p1503 good [young]_n109 friend, that [you]_p1506 will not discourse of things other than business in [your]_p1508 letters. [It]_p1509 will doubtless please [your]_p1510 friends to know that [you]_p1511 are well, and that [you]_p1512 look forward to getting home to them. Is [it]_p1513 not so?"" As [he]_p1514 spoke [he]_p1515 handed [me]_p1516 three sheets of note-paper and three envelopes. [They]_p1517 were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing [his]_p1518 quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, [I]_p1519 understood as well as if [he]_p1522 had spoken that [I]_p1520 should be careful what [I]_p1520 wrote, for [he]_p1523 would be able to read it. So [I]_p1524 determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to [her]_p1526 [I]_p1525 could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if [he]_p1527 did see it. When [I]_p1528 had written [my]_p1530 two letters [I]_p1529 sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as [he]_p1531 wrote [them]_p1532 to some books on [his]_p1533 table. Then [he]_p1534 took up [my]_p1535 two and placed [them]_p1536 with [his]_p1537 own, and put by [his]_p1538 writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind him, [I]_p1539 leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table. [I]_p1540 felt no compunction in doing so, for under the circumstances [I]_p1541 felt that [I]_p1541 should protect [myself]_p1544 in every way [I]_p1542 could. One of the letters was directed to [Samuel F]_n110. [Billington]_n,111 No.",3,,45,
stoker_dracula," 7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to [Herr Leutner]_n,112 Varna the third was to Coutts & [Co]_n113. , London, and the fourth to [Herren Klopstock]_n114 & Billreuth, bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. [I]_p1545 was just about to look at [them]_p1547 when [I]_p1546 saw the door-handle move. [I]_p1548 sank back in [my]_p1549 seat, having just had time to replace the letters as [they]_p1551 had been and to resume [my]_p1550 book before the Count, holding still another letter in [his]_p1552 hand, entered the room. [He]_p1553 took up the letters on the table and stamped [them]_p1554 carefully, and then turning to me, said:,   ""I trust [you]_p1557 will forgive me, but [I]_p1555 have much work to do in private this evening. [You]_p1558 will, [I]_p1559 hope, find all things as [you]_p1560 wish. "" At the door [he]_p1561 turned, and after a moment's pause said:, ""Let [me]_p1562 advise you, [my]_p1568 [dear]_n115 [young]_n116 friend, nay, let [me]_p1563 warn [you]_p1564 with all seriousness, that should [you]_p1565 leave these rooms [you]_p1565 will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. [It]_p1569 is old, and has many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then haste to [your]_p1570 own chamber or to these rooms, for [your]_p1571 rest will then be safe.",5,,25,
stoker_dracula," But if [you]_p1572 be not careful in this respect, then"", [He]_p1573 finished [his]_p1574 speech in a gruesome way, for [he]_p1576 motioned with [his]_p1575 hands as if [he]_p1577 were washing them. [I]_p1578 quite understood [my]_p1579 only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me. * * * * *  Later. , [I]_p1580 endorse the last words written, but this time there is no doubt in question. [I]_p1581 shall not fear to sleep in any place where [he]_p1582 is not. [I]_p1583 have placed the crucifix over the head of [my]_p1585 bed, [I]_p1584 imagine that [my]_p1586 [rest]_n117 is thus freer from dreams and there [it]_p1587 shall remain. When [he]_p1588 left [me]_p1589 [I]_p1590 went to [my]_p1591 room. After a little while, not hearing any sound, [I]_p1592 came out and went up the stone stair to where [I]_p1593 could look out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though [it]_p1594 was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, [I]_p1595 felt that [I]_p1596 was indeed in prison, and [I]_p1596 seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though [it]_p1598 were of the night.",1,,27,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p1599 am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. [It]_p1600 is destroying [my]_p1601 nerve. [I]_p1602 start at [my]_p1603 own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for [my]_p1604 terrible fear in this accursed place! [I]_p1605 looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till [it]_p1606 was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer [me]_p1607 there was peace and comfort in every breath [I]_p1608 drew. As [I]_p1609 leaned from the window [my]_p1611 eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to [my]_p1612 left, where [I]_p1610 imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The window at which [I]_p1613 stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete but [it]_p1614 was evidently many a day since the case had been there. [I]_p1615 drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out. What [I]_p1616 saw was the Count's head coming out from the window.",0,,18,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p1617 did not see the face, but [I]_p1618 knew the man by the neck and the movement of [his]_p1619 back and arms. In any case [I]_p1620 could not mistake the hands which [I]_p1621 had had so many opportunities of studying. [I]_p1622 was at first interested and somewhat amused, for [it]_p1623 is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when [he]_p1624 is a prisoner. But [my]_p1625 very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when [I]_p1626 saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down with [his]_p1627 cloak spreading out around [him]_p1628 like great wings. At first [I]_p1629 could not believe [my]_p1630 eyes. [I]_p1631 thought [it]_p1633 was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow but [I]_p1632 kept looking, and [it]_p1634 could be no delusion. [I]_p1635 saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall. What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is [it]_p1636 in the semblance of man? [I]_p1637 feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering [me]_p1641 [I]_p1638 am in fear, in awful fear, and there is no escape for [me]_p1642 [I]_p1638 am encompassed about with terrors that [I]_p1639 dare not think of. * * * * * 15 [May]_n118. , Once more have [I]_p1643 seen the Count go out in [his]_p1644 lizard fashion.",1,,28,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p1645 moved downwards in a [sidelong]_n119 way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left. [He]_p1646 vanished into some hole or window. When [his]_p1647 head had disappeared, [I]_p1648 leaned out to try and see more, but without avail, the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. [I]_p1649 knew [he]_p1651 had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than [I]_p1650 had dared to do as yet. [I]_p1652 went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors. [They]_p1653 were all locked, as [I]_p1654 had expected, and the locks were comparatively new but [I]_p1655 went down the stone stairs to the hall where [I]_p1655 had entered originally. [I]_p1657 found [I]_p1658 could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains but the door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's room [I]_p1658 must watch should [his]_p1661 door be unlocked, so that [I]_p1659 may get [it]_p1662 and escape. [I]_p1663 went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in [them]_p1664 except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last, however, [I]_p1665 found one door at the top of the stairway which, though [it]_p1666 seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure.",1,,22,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p1667 tried [it]_p1668 harder, and found that [it]_p1669 was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which [I]_p1670 might not have again, so [I]_p1671 exerted myself, and with many efforts forced [it]_p1673 back so that [I]_p1671 could enter. [I]_p1674 was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms [I]_p1675 knew and a storey lower down. From the windows [I]_p1676 could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides [it]_p1677 was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any [I]_p1678 had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst [it]_p1679 softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. [My]_p1680 lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but [I]_p1681 was glad to have [it]_p1682 with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled [my]_p1683 heart and made [my]_p1684 nerves tremble.",0,,18,
stoker_dracula," Still, [it]_p1685 was better than living alone in the rooms which [I]_p1686 had come to hate from the presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school [my]_p1688 nerves, [I]_p1687 found a soft quietude come over me. Here [I]_p1689 am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, [her]_p1691 ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in [my]_p1692 diary in shorthand all that has happened since [I]_p1690 closed [it]_p1693 last. [It]_p1694 is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless [my]_p1695 senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of [their]_p1696 own which mere ""modernity"" cannot kill. * * * * * Later: the Morning of 16 [May]_n120. , God preserve [my]_p1697 sanity, for to this [I]_p1698 am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past. Whilst [I]_p1699 live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that [I]_p1700 may not go mad, if, indeed, [I]_p1700 be not mad already. If [I]_p1702 be sane, then surely [it]_p1705 is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to [me]_p1706 that to [him]_p1707 alone [I]_p1703 can look for safety, even though this be only whilst [I]_p1703 can serve [his]_p1708 purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let [me]_p1709 be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed.",1,,25,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p1710 begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me. Up to now [I]_p1711 never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when [he]_p1713 made Hamlet say:,   ""My tablets! quick, [my]_p1714 tablets! 'Tis meet that [I]_p1712 put [it]_p1715 down,"" etc. ,  for now, feeling as though [my]_p1716 own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in [its]_p1718 undoing, [I]_p1719 turn to [my]_p1717 diary for repose. The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me. The Count's mysterious warning frightened [me]_p1720 at the time [it]_p1723 frightens [me]_p1721 more now when [I]_p1725 think of it, for in future [he]_p1726 has a fearful hold upon me. [I]_p1727 shall fear to doubt what [he]_p1730 may say!  When [I]_p1728 had written in [my]_p1731 diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in [my]_p1732 pocket [I]_p1728 felt sleepy. The Count's warning came into [my]_p1733 mind, but [I]_p1734 took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me, and with [it]_p1735 the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me. [I]_p1736 determined not to return [to-night]_n121 to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst [their]_p1737 gentle breasts were sad for [their]_p1738 menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars.",1,,27,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p1739 drew a great couch out of [its]_p1742 place near the corner, so that as [I]_p1740 lay, [I]_p1740 could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed [myself]_p1743 for sleep. [I]_p1744 suppose [I]_p1745 must have fallen asleep [I]_p1745 hope so, but [I]_p1746 fear, for all that followed was startlingly real, so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, [I]_p1746 cannot in the least believe that [it]_p1749 was all sleep. [I]_p1750 was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since [I]_p1751 came into [it]_p1754 [I]_p1752 could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, [my]_p1755 own footsteps marked where [I]_p1752 had disturbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opposite [me]_p1756 were three [young]_n122 women, ladies by [their]_p1757 dress and manner. [I]_p1758 thought at the time that [I]_p1759 must be dreaming when [I]_p1759 saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, [they]_p1761 threw no shadow on the floor. [They]_p1762 came close to me, and looked at [me]_p1763 for some time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires. [I]_p1765 seemed somehow to know [her]_p1767 face, and to know [it]_p1768 in connection with some dreamy fear, but [I]_p1766 could not recollect at the moment how or where.",1,,29,
stoker_dracula," All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of [their]_p1769 voluptuous lips. There was something about [them]_p1770 that made [me]_p1771 uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear. [I]_p1772 felt in [my]_p1773 heart a wicked, burning desire that [they]_p1774 would kiss [me]_p1775 with those red lips. [It]_p1776 is not good to note this down, lest some day [it]_p1777 should meet [Mina]_n's123 eyes and cause [her]_p1779 pain but [it]_p1778 is the truth. [They]_p1780 whispered together, and then [they]_p1781 all three laughed, such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips. [It]_p1782 was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook [her]_p1783 head coquettishly, and the other two urged [her]_p1784 on. One said:,   ""Go on! [You]_p1785 are first, and [we]_p1786 shall follow [yours]_p1787 is the right to begin. "" The other added:, ""He is [young]_n124 and strong there are kisses for [us]_p1788 all. "" [I]_p1789 lay quiet, looking out under [my]_p1790 eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.",2,,22,
stoker_dracula," The fair girl advanced and bent over [me]_p1791 till [I]_p1793 could feel the movement of [her]_p1794 breath upon me. Sweet [it]_p1795 was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as [her]_p1796 voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood. [I]_p1797 was afraid to raise [my]_p1798 eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes. The girl went on [her]_p1799 knees, and bent over me, simply gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as [she]_p1800 arched [her]_p1802 neck [she]_p1801 actually licked [her]_p1803 lips like an animal, till [I]_p1804 could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as [it]_p1805 lapped the white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went [her]_p1806 head as the lips went below the range of [my]_p1807 mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on [my]_p1808 throat. Then [she]_p1809 paused, and [I]_p1810 could hear the churning sound of [her]_p1811 tongue as [it]_p1813 licked [her]_p1812 teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on [my]_p1814 neck. Then the skin of [my]_p1815 throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that is to tickle [it]_p1816 approaches nearer, nearer. [I]_p1817 could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of [my]_p1818 throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there. [I]_p1819 closed [my]_p1820 eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited, waited with beating heart.",0,,29,
stoker_dracula," But at that instant, another sensation swept through [me]_p1821 as quick as lightning. [I]_p1822 was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of [his]_p1823 being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As [my]_p1824 eyes opened involuntarily [I]_p1825 saw [his]_p1826 strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant's power draw [it]_p1827 back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the Count! Never did [I]_p1828 imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit. [His]_p1829 eyes were positively blazing. The red light in [them]_p1830 was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. [His]_p1832 face was deathly pale, and the lines of [it]_p1833 were hard like drawn wires  the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of [his]_p1834 arm, [he]_p1835 hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though [he]_p1836 were beating [them]_p1837 back [it]_p1838 was the same imperious gesture that [I]_p1839 had seen used to the wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room [he]_p1840 said:,   ""How dare [you]_p1841 touch him, any of you? How dare [you]_p1842 cast eyes on [him]_p1847 when [I]_p1850 had forbidden it? Back, [I]_p1851 tell [you]_p1842 all! This man belongs to me! Beware how [you]_p1843 meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me. "" The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:,   ""You [yourself]_p1852 never loved [you]_p1853 never love!"" On this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that [it]_p1854 almost made [me]_p1856 faint to hear [it]_p1855 seemed like the pleasure of fiends.",0,,31,
stoker_dracula," Then the Count turned, after looking at [my]_p1857 face attentively, and said in a soft whisper:,   ""Yes, [I]_p1858 too can love [you]_p1859 yourselves can tell [it]_p1860 from the past. Is [it]_p1861 not so? Well, now [I]_p1862 promise [you]_p1864 that when [I]_p1863 am done with [him]_p1866 [you]_p1865 shall kiss [him]_p1867 at [your]_p1868 will. Now go! go! [I]_p1869 must awaken him, for there is work to be done. "" ""Are [we]_p1870 to have nothing [to-night]_n?""125 said one of them, with a low laugh, as [she]_p1871 pointed to the bag which [he]_p1872 had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer [he]_p1873 nodded [his]_p1874 head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If [my]_p1875 ears did not deceive [me]_p1876 there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst [I]_p1877 was aghast with horror but as [I]_p1878 looked [they]_p1879 disappeared, and with [them]_p1880 the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and [they]_p1881 could not have passed [me]_p1882 without [my]_p1883 noticing. [They]_p1884 simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for [I]_p1885 could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before [they]_p1886 entirely faded away.",1,,30,
stoker_dracula," Then the horror overcame me, and [I]_p1887 sank down unconscious. CHAPTER IV [JONATHAN HARKER]_n'S126 JOURNAL, continued [I]_p1888 awoke in [my]_p1889 own bed. If [it]_p1890 be that [I]_p1891 had not dreamt, the Count must have carried [me]_p1892 here. [I]_p1893 tried to satisfy [myself]_p1894 on the subject, but could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that [my]_p1895 clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not [my]_p1896 habit. [My]_p1897 watch was still unwound, and [I]_p1898 am rigorously accustomed to wind [it]_p1899 the last thing before going to bed, and many such details. But these things are no proof, for [they]_p1900 may have been evidences that [my]_p1901 mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or another, [I]_p1902 had certainly been much upset. [I]_p1903 must watch for proof. Of one thing [I]_p1904 am glad: if [it]_p1905 was that the Count carried [me]_p1906 here and undressed me, [he]_p1908 must have been hurried in [his]_p1909 task, for [my]_p1910 pockets are intact. [I]_p1911 am sure this diary would have been a mystery to [him]_p1912 which [he]_p1913 would not have brooked.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p1914 would have taken or destroyed it. As [I]_p1915 look round this room, although [it]_p1916 has been to [me]_p1918 so full of fear, [it]_p1917 is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who were, who are, waiting to suck [my]_p1919 blood. * * * * * 18 [May]_n127. , [I]_p1920 have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for [I]_p1921 must know the truth. When [I]_p1922 got to the doorway at the top of the stairs [I]_p1923 found [it]_p1924 closed. [It]_p1925 had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. [I]_p1926 could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside. [I]_p1927 fear [it]_p1928 was no dream, and must act on this surmise. * * * * * 19 [May]_n128. , [I]_p1929 am surely in the toils.",2,,16,
stoker_dracula," Last night the Count asked [me]_p1930 in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that [my]_p1931 work here was nearly done, and that [I]_p1932 should start for home within a few days, another that [I]_p1933 was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that [I]_p1933 had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz. [I]_p1935 would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state of things [it]_p1937 would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst [I]_p1936 am so absolutely in [his]_p1938 power and to refuse would be to excite [his]_p1939 suspicion and to arouse [his]_p1939 anger. [He]_p1941 knows that [I]_p1942 know too much, and that [I]_p1943 must not live, lest [I]_p1943 be dangerous to [him]_p1945 [my]_p1946 only chance is to prolong [my]_p1947 opportunities. Something may occur which will give [me]_p1948 a chance to escape. [I]_p1949 saw in [his]_p1950 eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when [he]_p1951 hurled that fair woman from him. [He]_p1952 explained to [me]_p1953 that posts were few and uncertain, and that [my]_p1955 writing now would ensure ease of mind to [my]_p1956 friends and [he]_p1959 assured [me]_p1954 with so much impressiveness that [he]_p1960 would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at [Bistritz]_n129 until due time in case chance would admit of [my]_p1956 prolonging [my]_p1957 stay, that to oppose [him]_p1961 would have been to create new suspicion. [I]_p1962 therefore pretended to fall in with [his]_p1964 views, and asked [him]_p1965 what dates [I]_p1963 should put on the letters. [He]_p1966 calculated a minute, and then said:,   ""The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29. ""  [I]_p1967 know now the span of [my]_p1968 life. God help me! * * * * * 28 [May]_n130.",2,,39,
stoker_dracula," , There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies [I]_p1969 have notes of [them]_p1970 in [my]_p1971 book. [They]_p1972 are peculiar to this part of the world, though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands of [them]_p1973 in Hungary and [Transylvania]_n,131 who are almost outside all law. [They]_p1974 attach [themselves]_p1975 as a rule to some great noble or boyar, and call [themselves]_p1976 by [his]_p1977 name. [They]_p1978 are fearless and without religion, save superstition, and [they]_p1979 talk only [their]_p1980 own varieties of the [Romany]_n132 tongue. [I]_p1981 shall write some letters home, and shall try to get [them]_p1982 to have [them]_p1983 posted. [I]_p1984 have already spoken [them]_p1985 through [my]_p1986 window to begin acquaintanceship. [They]_p1987 took [their]_p1988 hats off and made obeisance and many signs, which, however, [I]_p1990 could not understand any more than [I]_p1991 could [their]_p1989 spoken language.",2,,23,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  [I]_p1992 have written the letters. Mina's is in shorthand, and [I]_p1993 simply ask [Mr Hawkins]_n133 to communicate with her. To [her]_p1994 [I]_p1995 have explained [my]_p1997 situation, but without the horrors which [I]_p1996 may only surmise. [It]_p1998 would shock and frighten [her]_p1999 to death were [I]_p2001 to expose [my]_p2002 heart to her. Should the letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know [my]_p2003 secret or the extent of [my]_p2004 knowledge. * * * * *  [I]_p2005 have given the letters [I]_p2006 threw [them]_p2008 through the bars of [my]_p2010 window with a gold piece, and made what signs [I]_p2006 could to have [them]_p2009 posted. The man who took [them]_p2011 pressed [them]_p2012 to [his]_p2014 heart and bowed, and then put [them]_p2012 in [his]_p2015 cap. [I]_p2016 could do no more. [I]_p2017 stole back to the study, and began to read. As the Count did not come in, [I]_p2018 have written here.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  The Count has come. [He]_p2019 sat down beside me, and said in [his]_p2022 smoothest voice as [he]_p2023 opened two letters:,   ""The Szgany has given [me]_p2020 these, of which, though [I]_p2024 know not whence [they]_p2026 come, [I]_p2025 shall, of course, take care. See!"", [he]_p2027 must have looked at it, ""one is from you, and to [my]_p2030 friend Peter Hawkins the other"", here [he]_p2028 caught sight of the strange symbols as [he]_p2028 opened the envelope, and the dark look came into [his]_p2031 face, and [his]_p2032 eyes blazed wickedly, ""the other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! [It]_p2033 is not signed. Well! so [it]_p2034 cannot matter to us. "" And [he]_p2035 calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till [they]_p2036 were consumed. Then [he]_p2037 went on:,   ""The letter to Hawkins, that [I]_p2038 shall, of course, send on, since [it]_p2039 is yours. [Your]_p2040 letters are sacred to me. [Your]_p2041 pardon, [my]_p2042 friend, that unknowingly [I]_p2043 did break the seal. Will [you]_p2044 not cover [it]_p2045 again?"" [He]_p2046 held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed [me]_p2047 a clean envelope. [I]_p2049 could only redirect [it]_p2050 and hand [it]_p2051 to [him]_p2052 in silence.",0,,32,
stoker_dracula," When [he]_p2053 went out of the room [I]_p2054 could hear the key turn softly. A minute later [I]_p2055 went over and tried it, and the door was locked. When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, [his]_p2056 coming awakened me, for [I]_p2057 had gone to sleep on the sofa. [He]_p2058 was very courteous and very cheery in [his]_p2059 manner, and seeing that [I]_p2060 had been sleeping, [he]_p2061 said:,   ""So, [my]_p2062 friend, [you]_p2063 are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest [rest]_n134. [I]_p2064 may not have the pleasure to talk [to-night]_n,135 since there are many labours to [me]_p2066 but [you]_p2067 will sleep, [I]_p2065 pray. "" [I]_p2068 passed to [my]_p2069 room and went to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has [its]_p2070 own calms. * * * * * 31 [May]_n136. , This morning when [I]_p2071 woke [I]_p2072 thought [I]_p2072 would provide [myself]_p2077 with some paper and envelopes from [my]_p2078 bag and keep [them]_p2083 in [my]_p2079 pocket, so that [I]_p2073 might write in case [I]_p2073 should get an opportunity, but again a surprise, again a shock!  Every scrap of paper was gone, and with [it]_p2084 all [my]_p2079 notes, [my]_p2080 memoranda, relating to railways and travel, [my]_p2080 letter of credit, in fact all that might be useful to [me]_p2085 were [I]_p2073 once outside the castle.",3,,33,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2086 sat and pondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and [I]_p2087 made search of [my]_p2089 portmanteau and in the wardrobe where [I]_p2087 had placed [my]_p2090 clothes. The suit in which [I]_p2091 had travelled was gone, and also [my]_p2093 overcoat and rug [I]_p2092 could find no trace of [them]_p2094 anywhere. This looked like some new scheme of villainy. * * * * *  17 June. , This morning, as [I]_p2095 was sitting on the edge of [my]_p2097 bed cudgelling [my]_p2098 brains, [I]_p2096 heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard. With joy [I]_p2099 hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with [his]_p2100 wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots. [They]_p2101 had also [their]_p2102 long staves in hand. [I]_p2103 ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join [them]_p2105 through the main hall, as [I]_p2104 thought that way might be opened for them. Again a shock: [my]_p2107 door was fastened on the outside. Then [I]_p2108 ran to the window and cried to them.",0,,22,
stoker_dracula," [They]_p2109 looked up at [me]_p2110 stupidly and pointed, but just then the ""hetman"" of the Szgany came out, and seeing [them]_p2111 pointing to [my]_p2112 window, said something, at which [they]_p2113 laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised entreaty, would make [them]_p2114 even look at me. [They]_p2115 resolutely turned away. The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by [their]_p2116 resonance as [they]_p2117 were roughly moved. When [they]_p2118 were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on [it]_p2119 for luck, lazily went each to [his]_p2120 horse's head. Shortly afterwards, [I]_p2121 heard the cracking of [their]_p2122 whips die away in the distance. * * * * *  24 June, before morning. , Last night the Count left [me]_p2123 early, and locked [himself]_p2124 into [his]_p2125 own room. As soon as [I]_p2126 dared [I]_p2127 ran up the winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. [I]_p2128 thought [I]_p2129 would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.",0,,21,
stoker_dracula," The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind. [I]_p2130 know it, for now and then [I]_p2131 hear a far-away muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and, whatever [it]_p2132 is, [it]_p2133 must be the end of some ruthless villainy. [I]_p2135 had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when [I]_p2136 saw something coming out of the Count's window. [I]_p2137 drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. [It]_p2138 was a new shock to [me]_p2139 to find that [he]_p2140 had on the suit of clothes which [I]_p2141 had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over [his]_p2143 shoulder the terrible bag which [I]_p2142 had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to [his]_p2144 quest, and in [my]_p2146 garb, too! This, then, is [his]_p2145 new scheme of evil: that [he]_p2148 will allow others to see me, as [they]_p2151 think, so that [he]_p2149 may both leave evidence that [I]_p2152 have been seen in the towns or villages posting [my]_p2147 own letters, and that any wickedness which [he]_p2149 may do shall by the local people be attributed to me. [It]_p2153 makes [me]_p2154 rage to think that this can go on, and whilst [I]_p2155 am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal's right and consolation. [I]_p2156 thought [I]_p2157 would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time sat doggedly at the window. Then [I]_p2158 began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. [They]_p2159 were like the tiniest grains of dust, and [they]_p2160 whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way.",0,,30,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2161 watched [them]_p2162 with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. [I]_p2163 leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that [I]_p2164 could enjoy more fully the a rial gambolling. Something made [me]_p2165 start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from [my]_p2166 sight. Louder [it]_p2167 seemed to ring in [my]_p2168 ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as [they]_p2169 danced in the moonlight. [I]_p2170 felt [myself]_p2171 struggling to awake to some call of [my]_p2172 instincts nay, [my]_p2173 very soul was struggling, and [my]_p2173 half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. [I]_p2175 was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust the moonbeams seemed to quiver as [they]_p2176 went by [me]_p2177 into the mass of gloom beyond. More and more [they]_p2178 gathered till [they]_p2179 seemed to take dim phantom shapes. And then [I]_p2180 started, broad awake and in full possession of [my]_p2181 senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom [I]_p2182 was doomed. [I]_p2183 fled, and felt somewhat safer in [my]_p2184 own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly.",0,,24,
stoker_dracula," When a couple of hours had passed [I]_p2185 heard something stirring in the Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed and then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a beating heart, [I]_p2186 tried the door but [I]_p2187 was locked in [my]_p2188 prison, and could do nothing. [I]_p2189 sat down and simply cried. As [I]_p2190 sat [I]_p2191 heard a sound in the courtyard without, the agonised cry of a woman. [I]_p2192 rushed to the window, and throwing [it]_p2193 up, peered out between the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding [her]_p2194 hands over [her]_p2195 heart as one distressed with running. [She]_p2196 was leaning against a corner of the gateway. When [she]_p2197 saw [my]_p2199 face at the window [she]_p2198 threw [herself]_p2202 forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:,   ""Monster, give [me]_p2204 [my]_p2200 child!""  [She]_p2205 threw [herself]_p2203 on [her]_p2206 knees, and raising up [her]_p2207 hands, cried the same words in tones which wrung [my]_p2200 heart. Then [she]_p2208 tore [her]_p2209 hair and beat [her]_p2210 breast, and abandoned [herself]_p2211 to all the violences of extravagant emotion. Finally, [she]_p2212 threw [herself]_p2213 forward, and, though [I]_p2214 could not see her, [I]_p2215 could hear the beating of [her]_p2216 naked hands against the door.",0,,32,
stoker_dracula," Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, [I]_p2218 heard the voice of the Count calling in [his]_p2219 harsh, metallic whisper. [His]_p2220 call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes had passed a pack of [them]_p2221 poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard. There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short. Before long [they]_p2222 streamed away singly, licking [their]_p2223 lips. [I]_p2224 could not pity her, for [I]_p2225 knew now what had become of [her]_p2226 child, and [she]_p2228 was better dead. What shall [I]_p2229 do? what can [I]_p2230 do? How can [I]_p2230 escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear?  * * * * *  25 June, morning. , No man knows till [he]_p2232 has suffered from the night how sweet and how [dear]_n137 to [his]_p2233 heart and eye the morning can be. When the sun grew so high this morning that [it]_p2234 struck the top of the great gateway opposite [my]_p2236 window, the high spot which [it]_p2235 touched seemed to [me]_p2237 as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. [My]_p2238 fear fell from [me]_p2239 as if [it]_p2240 had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth.",1,,22,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2241 must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last night one of [my]_p2242 post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of [my]_p2243 existence from the earth. Let [me]_p2244 not think of it. Action!  [It]_p2245 has always been at night-time that [I]_p2246 have been molested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. [I]_p2247 have not yet seen the Count in the daylight. Can [it]_p2248 be that [he]_p2249 sleeps when others wake, that [he]_p2250 may be awake whilst [they]_p2251 sleep? If [I]_p2252 could only get into [his]_p2253 room! But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me. Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where [his]_p2254 body has gone why may not another body go? [I]_p2256 have seen [him]_p2257 [myself]_p2258 crawl from [his]_p2255 window. Why should not [I]_p2259 imitate him, and go in by [his]_p2260 window? The chances are desperate, but [my]_p2261 need is more desperate still.",0,,21,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2262 shall risk it. At the worst [it]_p2263 can only be death and a man's death is not a calf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help [me]_p2264 in [my]_p2265 task! Good-bye, Mina, if [I]_p2267 fail good-bye, [my]_p2266 faithful friend and second father good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!  * * * * *  Same day, later. , [I]_p2268 have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room. [I]_p2269 must put down every detail in order. [I]_p2270 went whilst [my]_p2271 courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. [I]_p2272 took off [my]_p2273 boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. [I]_p2274 looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept [my]_p2275 eyes away from it. [I]_p2276 knew pretty well the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for [it]_p2278 as well as [I]_p2277 could, having regard to the opportunities available.",0,,17,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2279 did not feel dizzy, [I]_p2280 suppose [I]_p2280 was too excited, and the time seemed ridiculously short till [I]_p2281 found [myself]_p2283 standing on the window-sill and trying to raise up the sash. [I]_p2284 was filled with agitation, however, when [I]_p2285 bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then [I]_p2286 looked around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery. The room was empty! [It]_p2287 was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. [I]_p2288 looked for the key, but [it]_p2290 was not in the lock, and [I]_p2289 could not find [it]_p2291 anywhere. The only thing [I]_p2292 found was a great heap of gold in one corner, gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and [Hungarian]_n,138 and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though [it]_p2293 had lain long in the ground. None of [it]_p2294 that [I]_p2295 noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of [them]_p2296 old and stained. At one corner of the room was a heavy door. [I]_p2297 tried it, for, since [I]_p2298 could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of [my]_p2300 search, [I]_p2298 must make further examination, or all [my]_p2301 efforts would be in vain.",1,,23,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p2302 was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. [I]_p2303 descended, minding carefully where [I]_p2304 went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned. As [I]_p2305 went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier. At last [I]_p2306 pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found [myself]_p2307 in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and [I]_p2308 made search for any further outlet, but there was none. Then [I]_p2309 went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance. [I]_p2310 went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to [my]_p2311 very soul. Into two of these [I]_p2312 went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust in the third, however, [I]_p2313 made a discovery.",0,,12,
stoker_dracula," There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! [He]_p2314 was either dead or asleep, [I]_p2315 could not say which, for the eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death, and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all [their]_p2316 pallor the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. [I]_p2317 bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. [He]_p2318 could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours. By the side of the box was [its]_p2319 cover, pierced with holes here and there. [I]_p2320 thought [he]_p2324 might have the keys on him, but when [I]_p2321 went to search [I]_p2321 saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though [they]_p2325 were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of [me]_p2326 or [my]_p2327 presence, that [I]_p2322 fled from the place, and leaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall. Regaining [my]_p2328 room, [I]_p2329 threw [myself]_p2330 panting upon the bed and tried to think. * * * * *  29 June. , To-day is the date of [my]_p2331 last letter, and the Count has taken steps to prove that [it]_p2333 was genuine, for again [I]_p2334 saw [him]_p2335 leave the castle by the same window, and in [my]_p2332 clothes. As [he]_p2336 went down the wall, lizard fashion, [I]_p2337 wished [I]_p2338 had a gun or some lethal weapon, that [I]_p2338 might destroy [him]_p2341 but [I]_p2339 fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would have any effect on him.",0,,28,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2343 dared not wait to see [him]_p2345 return, for [I]_p2344 feared to see those weird sisters. [I]_p2346 came back to the library, and read there till [I]_p2347 fell asleep. [I]_p2348 was awakened by the Count, who looked at [me]_p2349 as grimly as a man can look as [he]_p2350 said:,   ""To-morrow, [my]_p2351 friend, [we]_p2352 must part. [You]_p2353 return to [your]_p2354 beautiful England, [I]_p2355 to some work which may have such an end that [we]_p2356 may never meet. [Your]_p2357 letter home has been despatched to-morrow [I]_p2358 shall not be here, but all shall be ready for [your]_p2359 journey. In the morning come the Szgany, who have some labours of [their]_p2360 own here, and also come some [Slovaks]_n139. When [they]_p2361 have gone, [my]_p2362 carriage shall come for you, and shall bear [you]_p2363 to the [Borgo Pass]_n140 to meet the diligence from [Bukovina]_n141 to [Bistritz]_n142. But [I]_p2365 am in hopes that [I]_p2366 shall see more of [you]_p2367 at [Castle Dracula]_n143. "" [I]_p2368 suspected him, and determined to test [his]_p2369 sincerity. Sincerity! [It]_p2370 seems like a profanation of the word to write [it]_p2371 in connection with such a monster, so asked [him]_p2372 point-blank:, ""Why may [I]_p2373 not go [to-night]_n?""144 ""Because, [dear]_n145 sir, [my]_p2374 coachman and horses are away on a mission.",7,,31,
stoker_dracula," ""  ""But [I]_p2375 would walk with pleasure. [I]_p2376 want to get away at once. "" [He]_p2377 smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that [I]_p2378 knew there was some trick behind [his]_p2379 smoothness. [He]_p2380 said:,   ""And [your]_p2381 baggage?""  ""I do not care about it. [I]_p2382 can send for [it]_p2383 some other time. ""  The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made [me]_p2384 rub [my]_p2385 eyes, [it]_p2387 seemed so real:,   ""You English have a saying which is close to [my]_p2386 heart, for [its]_p2388 spirit is that which rules [our]_p2389 boyars: 'Welcome the coming speed the parting guest. ' Come with me, [my]_p2390 [dear]_n146 [young]_n147 friend. Not an hour shall [you]_p2391 wait in [my]_p2393 house against [your]_p2394 will, though sad am [I]_p2396 at [your]_p2395 going, and that [you]_p2392 so suddenly desire it. Come!"" With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded [me]_p2397 down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly [he]_p2398 stopped.",2,,24,
stoker_dracula," ""[Hark]_n!""148 Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. [It]_p2399 was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of [his]_p2400 hand, just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the b ton of the conductor. After a pause of a moment, [he]_p2401 proceeded, in [his]_p2402 stately way, to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw [it]_p2403 open. To [my]_p2404 intense astonishment [I]_p2405 saw that [it]_p2406 was unlocked. Suspiciously, [I]_p2407 looked all round, but could see no key of any kind. As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier [their]_p2408 red jaws, with champing teeth, and [their]_p2409 blunt-clawed feet as [they]_p2410 leaped, came in through the opening door. [I]_p2411 knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such allies as these at [his]_p2412 command, [I]_p2413 could do nothing. But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap. Suddenly [it]_p2414 struck [me]_p2415 that this might be the moment and means of [my]_p2416 doom [I]_p2418 was to be given to the wolves, and at [my]_p2417 own instigation.",1,,20,
stoker_dracula," There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as a last chance [I]_p2419 cried out:,   ""Shut the door [I]_p2420 shall wait till morning!"" and covered [my]_p2421 face with [my]_p2422 hands to hide [my]_p2422 tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of [his]_p2424 powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as [they]_p2425 shot back into [their]_p2426 places. In silence [we]_p2427 returned to the library, and after a minute or two [I]_p2428 went to [my]_p2429 own room. The last [I]_p2430 saw of [Count Dracula]_n149 was [his]_p2431 kissing [his]_p2432 hand to [me]_p2434 with a red light of triumph in [his]_p2432 eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of. When [I]_p2435 was in [my]_p2438 room and about to lie down, [I]_p2436 thought [I]_p2436 heard a whispering at [my]_p2439 door. [I]_p2440 went to [it]_p2441 softly and listened. Unless [my]_p2442 ears deceived me, [I]_p2443 heard the voice of the Count:,   ""Back, back, to [your]_p2444 own place! [Your]_p2445 time is not yet come. Wait! Have patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!"" There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage [I]_p2446 threw open the door, and saw without the three terrible women licking [their]_p2447 lips. As [I]_p2448 appeared [they]_p2449 all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.",1,,31,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2450 came back to [my]_p2451 room and threw [myself]_p2453 on [my]_p2452 knees. [It]_p2454 is then so near the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! [Lord]_n,150 help me, and those to whom [I]_p2455 am [dear]_n!151 * * * * * 30 June, morning. , These may be the last words [I]_p2456 ever write in this diary. [I]_p2457 slept till just before the dawn, and when [I]_p2458 woke threw [myself]_p2460 on [my]_p2461 knees, for [I]_p2458 determined that if Death came [he]_p2462 should find [me]_p2463 ready. At last [I]_p2464 felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and [I]_p2465 felt that [I]_p2466 was safe. With a glad heart, [I]_p2467 opened [my]_p2468 door and ran down to the hall. [I]_p2469 had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands that trembled with eagerness, [I]_p2470 unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts. But the door would not move.",2,,21,
stoker_dracula," Despair seized me. [I]_p2471 pulled, and pulled, at the door, and shook [it]_p2472 till, massive as [it]_p2473 was, [it]_p2473 rattled in [its]_p2475 casement. [I]_p2476 could see the bolt shot. [It]_p2477 had been locked after [I]_p2478 left the Count. Then a wild desire took [me]_p2479 to obtain that key at any risk, and [I]_p2480 determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's room. [He]_p2481 might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils. Without a pause [I]_p2482 rushed up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count's room. [It]_p2483 was empty, but that was as [I]_p2484 expected. [I]_p2485 could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained. [I]_p2486 went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel.",0,,16,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2487 knew now well enough where to find the monster [I]_p2488 sought. The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in [their]_p2489 places to be hammered home. [I]_p2490 knew [I]_p2491 must reach the body for the key, so [I]_p2491 raised the lid, and laid [it]_p2494 back against the wall and then [I]_p2492 saw something which filled [my]_p2495 very soul with horror. There lay the Count, but looking as if [his]_p2496 youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. [It]_p2497 seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood. [He]_p2498 lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with [his]_p2499 repletion. [I]_p2500 shuddered as [I]_p2501 bent over to touch him, and every sense in [me]_p2504 revolted at the contact but [I]_p2501 had to search, or [I]_p2502 was lost. The coming night might see [my]_p2505 own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three. [I]_p2506 felt all over the body, but no sign could [I]_p2507 find of the key.",0,,21,
stoker_dracula," Then [I]_p2508 stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive [me]_p2509 mad. This was the being [I]_p2510 was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come [he]_p2511 might, amongst [its]_p2512 teeming millions, satiate [his]_p2513 lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove [me]_p2514 mad. A terrible desire came upon [me]_p2515 to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but [I]_p2516 seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting [it]_p2517 high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as [I]_p2518 did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all [their]_p2519 blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in [my]_p2520 hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from [my]_p2521 hand across the box, and as [I]_p2523 pulled [it]_p2524 away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from [my]_p2522 sight. The last glimpse [I]_p2525 had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held [its]_p2526 own in the nethermost hell.",0,,19,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2527 thought and thought what should be [my]_p2529 next move, but [my]_p2530 brain seemed on fire, and [I]_p2528 waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As [I]_p2531 waited [I]_p2532 heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through [their]_p2533 song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, [I]_p2534 ran from the place and gained the Count's room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened. With strained ears, [I]_p2535 listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. [I]_p2536 turned to run down again towards the vault, where [I]_p2537 might find the new entrance  but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying. When [I]_p2538 ran to push [it]_p2540 open, [I]_p2539 found that [it]_p2541 was hopelessly fast. [I]_p2542 was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round [me]_p2543 more closely. As [I]_p2544 write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with [their]_p2545 freight of earth.",0,,19,
stoker_dracula," There is a sound of hammering [it]_p2546 is the box being nailed down. Now [I]_p2547 can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them. The door is shut, and the chains rattle there is a grinding of the key in the lock [I]_p2548 can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and shuts [I]_p2549 hear the creaking of lock and bolt. [Hark]_n!152 in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels, the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as [they]_p2550 pass into the distance. [I]_p2551 am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! [Mina]_n153 is a woman, and there is nought in common. [They]_p2552 are devils of the Pit!  [I]_p2553 shall not remain alone with [them]_p2556 [I]_p2554 shall try to scale the castle wall farther than [I]_p2554 have yet attempted. [I]_p2557 shall take some of the gold with me, lest [I]_p2558 want [it]_p2559 later. [I]_p2560 may find a way from this dreadful place. And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and [his]_p2561 children still walk with earthly feet!  At least God's mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the precipice is steep and high.",2,,16,
stoker_dracula," At [its]_p2562 foot a man may sleep, as a man. Good-bye, all! Mina! CHAPTER V Letter from Miss [Mina Murray]_n154 to Miss Lucy Westenra. ""9 [May]_n155. ""My dearest Lucy,,   ""Forgive [my]_p2563 long delay in writing, but [I]_p2564 have been simply overwhelmed with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying. [I]_p2565 am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where [we]_p2566 can talk together freely and build [our]_p2567 castles in the air. [I]_p2568 have been working very hard lately, because [I]_p2569 want to keep up with Jonathan's studies, and [I]_p2569 have been practising shorthand very assiduously. When [we]_p2571 are married [I]_p2572 shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if [I]_p2573 can stenograph well enough [I]_p2573 can take down what [he]_p2576 wants to say in this way and write [it]_p2577 out for [him]_p2578 on the typewriter, at which also [I]_p2574 am practising very hard. [He]_p2579 and [I]_p2580 sometimes write letters in shorthand, and [he]_p2581 is keeping a stenographic journal of [his]_p2582 travels abroad. When [I]_p2583 am with [you]_p2585 [I]_p2584 shall keep a diary in the same way.",2,,24,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2586 don't mean one of those two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a sort of journal which [I]_p2587 can write in whenever [I]_p2587 feel inclined. [I]_p2589 do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people but [it]_p2590 is not intended for them. [I]_p2591 may show [it]_p2592 to [Jonathan]_n156 some day if there is in [it]_p2593 anything worth sharing, but [it]_p2593 is really an exercise book. [I]_p2595 shall try to do what [I]_p2596 see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations. [I]_p2597 am told that, with a little practice, [one]_p2598 can remember all that goes on or that [one]_p2599 hears said during a day. However, [we]_p2600 shall see. [I]_p2601 will tell [you]_p2602 of [my]_p2603 little plans when [we]_p2604 meet. [I]_p2605 have just had a few hurried lines from [Jonathan]_n157 from [Transylvania]_n158.

There is really nothing to interest you. [Town]_n163 is very pleasant just now, and [we]_p2627 go a good deal to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the tall, curly-haired man, [I]_p2628 suppose [it]_p2629 was the one who was with [me]_p2630 at the last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was [Mr Holmwood]_n164. [He]_p2631 often comes to see us, and [he]_p2632 and mamma get on very well together [they]_p2633 have so many things to talk about in common. [We]_p2634 met some time ago a man that would just do for you, if [you]_p2635 were not already engaged to Jonathan. [He]_p2637 is an excellent parti, being handsome, well off, and of good birth.",2,,16,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p2638 is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! [He]_p2639 is only nine-and-twenty, and [he]_p2640 has an immense lunatic asylum all under [his]_p2641 own care. Mr Holmwood introduced [him]_p2642 to me, and [he]_p2643 called here to see us, and often comes now. [I]_p2644 think [he]_p2646 is one of the most resolute men [I]_p2645 ever saw, and yet the most calm. [He]_p2647 seems absolutely imperturbable. [I]_p2648 can fancy what a wonderful power [he]_p2649 must have over [his]_p2650 patients. [He]_p2651 has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read one's thoughts. [He]_p2652 tries this on very much with me, but [I]_p2653 flatter [myself]_p2654 [he]_p2655 has got a tough nut to crack. [I]_p2656 know that from [my]_p2657 glass. Do [you]_p2658 ever try to read [your]_p2663 own face? [I]_p2664 do, and [I]_p2665 can tell [you]_p2659 [it]_p2666 is not a bad study, and gives [you]_p2659 more trouble than [you]_p2660 can well fancy if [you]_p2660 have never tried it.",0,,29,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p2668 says that [I]_p2669 afford [him]_p2672 a curious psychological study, and [I]_p2670 humbly think [I]_p2670 do. [I]_p2673 do not, as [you]_p2674 know, take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. [Dress]_n165 is a bore. That is slang again, but never mind [Arthur]_n166 says that every day. There, [it]_p2675 is all out. Mina, [we]_p2676 have told all [our]_p2679 secrets to each other since [we]_p2677 were children [we]_p2677 have slept together and eaten together, and laughed and cried together and now, though [I]_p2680 have spoken, [I]_p2681 would like to speak more. Oh, [Mina]_n,167 couldn't [you]_p2682 guess? [I]_p2683 love him. [I]_p2684 am blushing as [I]_p2685 write, for although [I]_p2685 think [he]_p2687 loves me, [he]_p2688 has not told [me]_p2689 so in words. But oh, [Mina]_n,168 [I]_p2691 love [him]_p2694 [I]_p2692 love [him]_p2695 [I]_p2692 love him! There, that does [me]_p2697 good. [I]_p2698 wish [I]_p2699 were with you, [dear]_n,169 sitting by the fire undressing, as [we]_p2704 used to sit and [I]_p2699 would try to tell [you]_p2702 what [I]_p2700 feel.",5,,34,

""My [dear]_n,177 [it]_p2726 never rains but [it]_p2727 pours. How true the old proverbs are. Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet [I]_p2728 never had a proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day [I]_p2729 have had three. Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn't [it]_p2731 awful! [I]_p2732 feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows.",4,,10,
stoker_dracula," Oh, Mina, [I]_p2733 am so happy that [I]_p2734 don't know what to do with myself. And three proposals! But, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of the girls, or [they]_p2735 would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining [themselves]_p2737 injured and slighted if in [their]_p2738 very first day at home [they]_p2736 did not get six at least. Some girls are so vain! [You]_p2739 and I, Mina [dear]_n,178 who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can despise vanity. Well, [I]_p2740 must tell [you]_p2741 about the three, but [you]_p2742 must keep [it]_p2743 a secret, [dear]_n,179 from every one, except, of course, Jonathan. [You]_p2744 will tell him, because [I]_p2745 would, if [I]_p2746 were in [your]_p2747 place, certainly tell [Arthur]_n180. A woman ought to tell [her]_p2748 husband everything, don't [you]_p2749 think so, [dear]_n?,181 and [I]_p2750 must be fair. Men like women, certainly [their]_p2751 wives, to be quite as fair as [they]_p2752 are and women, [I]_p2754 am afraid, are not always quite as fair as [they]_p2753 should be. Well, [my]_p2755 [dear]_n,182 number One came just before lunch. [I]_p2756 told [you]_p2757 of him, [Dr John Seward]_n,183 the lunatic-asylum man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. [He]_p2758 was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same.",6,,26,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p2759 had evidently been schooling [himself]_p2760 as to all sorts of little things, and remembered [them]_p2761 but [he]_p2762 almost managed to sit down on [his]_p2765 silk hat, which men don't generally do when [they]_p2766 are cool, and then when [he]_p2763 wanted to appear at ease [he]_p2763 kept playing with a lancet in a way that made [me]_p2767 nearly scream. [He]_p2768 spoke to me, [Mina]_n,184 very straightforwardly. [He]_p2769 told [me]_p2770 how [dear]_n185 [I]_p2773 was to him, though [he]_p2774 had known [me]_p2771 so little, and what [his]_p2775 life would be with [me]_p2771 to help and cheer him. [He]_p2776 was going to tell [me]_p2777 how unhappy [he]_p2779 would be if [I]_p2783 did not care for him, but when [he]_p2780 saw [me]_p2778 cry [he]_p2780 said that [he]_p2781 was a brute and would not add to [my]_p2784 present trouble. Then [he]_p2785 broke off and asked if [I]_p2787 could love [him]_p2790 in time and when [I]_p2788 shook [my]_p2791 head [his]_p2792 hands trembled, and then with some hesitation [he]_p2786 asked [me]_p2793 if [I]_p2788 cared already for any one else. [He]_p2794 put [it]_p2795 very nicely, saying that [he]_p2796 did not want to wring [my]_p2797 confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, [I]_p2798 felt a sort of duty to tell [him]_p2799 that there was some one. [I]_p2800 only told [him]_p2804 that much, and then [he]_p2806 stood up, and [he]_p2807 looked very strong and very grave as [he]_p2807 took both [my]_p2810 hands in [his]_p2812 and said [he]_p2808 hoped [I]_p2801 would be happy, and that if [I]_p2801 ever wanted a friend [I]_p2802 must count [him]_p2805 one of [my]_p2811 best. Oh, Mina [dear]_n,186 [I]_p2813 can't help crying: and [you]_p2814 must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but [it]_p2815 isn't at all a happy thing when [you]_p2816 have to see a poor fellow, whom [you]_p2817 know loves [you]_p2817 honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to know that, no matter what [he]_p2820 may say at the moment, [you]_p2818 are passing quite out of [his]_p2821 life.",3,,63,
stoker_dracula," [My]_p2822 [dear]_n,187 [I]_p2823 must stop here at present, [I]_p2824 feel so miserable, though [I]_p2824 am so happy. ""[Evening]_n188. ""[Arthur]_n189 has just gone, and [I]_p2826 feel in better spirits than when [I]_p2827 left off, so [I]_p2827 can go on telling [you]_p2829 about the day. Well, [my]_p2830 [dear]_n,190 number Two came after lunch. [He]_p2831 is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and [he]_p2832 looks so [young]_n191 and so fresh that [it]_p2834 seems almost impossible that [he]_p2833 has been to so many places and has had such adventures. [I]_p2835 sympathise with poor Desdemona when [she]_p2836 had such a dangerous stream poured in [her]_p2837 ear, even by a black man. [I]_p2838 suppose that [we]_p2839 women are such cowards that [we]_p2840 think a man will save [us]_p2842 from fears, and [we]_p2840 marry him. [I]_p2843 know now what [I]_p2844 would do if [I]_p2844 were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, [I]_p2846 don't, for there was [Mr Morris]_n192 telling [us]_p2848 [his]_p2849 stories, and [Arthur]_n193 never told any, and yet, , [My]_p2850 [dear]_n,194 [I]_p2847 am somewhat previous. [Mr Quincey]_n195 P.",9,,29,
stoker_dracula," [Morris]_n196 found [me]_p2851 alone. [It]_p2852 seems that a man always does find a girl alone. No, [he]_p2853 doesn't, for [Arthur]_n197 tried twice to make a chance, and [I]_p2854 helping [him]_p2857 all [I]_p2855 could [I]_p2855 am not ashamed to say [it]_p2858 now. [I]_p2859 must tell [you]_p2861 beforehand that Mr Morris doesn't always speak slang, that is to say, [he]_p2862 never does so to strangers or before them, for [he]_p2863 is really well educated and has exquisite manners, but [he]_p2863 found out that [it]_p2866 amused [me]_p2867 to hear [him]_p2868 talk American slang, and whenever [I]_p2860 was present, and there was no one to be shocked, [he]_p2864 said such funny things. [I]_p2869 am afraid, [my]_p2870 [dear]_n,198 [he]_p2871 has to invent [it]_p2873 all, for [it]_p2874 fits exactly into whatever else [he]_p2872 has to say. But this is a way slang has. [I]_p2875 do not know [myself]_p2879 if [I]_p2876 shall ever speak slang [I]_p2876 do not know if [Arthur]_n199 likes it, as [I]_p2877 have never heard [him]_p2880 use any as yet. Well, [Mr Morris]_n200 sat down beside [me]_p2881 and looked as happy and jolly as [he]_p2882 could, but [I]_p2884 could see all the same that [he]_p2883 was very nervous. [He]_p2885 took [my]_p2886 hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:, ""'Miss Lucy, [I]_p2887 know [I]_p2888 ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of [your]_p2890 little shoes, but [I]_p2888 guess if [you]_p2891 wait till [you]_p2892 find a man that is [you]_p2892 will go join [them]_p2895 seven [young]_n201 women with the lamps when [you]_p2893 quit. Won't [you]_p2896 just hitch up alongside of [me]_p2897 and let [us]_p2898 go down the long road together, driving in double harness?' ""Well, [he]_p2899 did look so good-humoured and so jolly that [it]_p2900 didn't seem half so hard to refuse [him]_p2902 as [it]_p2901 did poor Dr [Seward]_n202 so [I]_p2903 said, as lightly as [I]_p2904 could, that [I]_p2904 did not know anything of hitching, and that [I]_p2905 wasn't broken to harness at all yet.",7,,56,
stoker_dracula," Then [he]_p2907 said that [he]_p2908 had spoken in a light manner, and [he]_p2908 hoped that if [he]_p2909 had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, [I]_p2911 would forgive him. [He]_p2912 really did look serious when [he]_p2913 was saying it, and [I]_p2915 couldn't help feeling a bit serious too, [I]_p2916 know, Mina, [you]_p2918 will think [me]_p2919 a horrid flirt, though [I]_p2916 couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that [he]_p2914 was number two in one day. And then, [my]_p2920 [dear]_n,203 before [I]_p2922 could say a word [he]_p2923 began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying [his]_p2924 very heart and soul at [my]_p2921 feet. [He]_p2925 looked so earnest over [it]_p2926 that [I]_p2927 shall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest, because [he]_p2928 is merry at times. [I]_p2929 suppose [he]_p2933 saw something in [my]_p2935 face which checked him, for [he]_p2934 suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that [I]_p2930 could have loved [him]_p2936 for if [I]_p2930 had been free:,   ""'Lucy, [you]_p2938 are an honest-hearted girl, [I]_p2931 know. [I]_p2939 should not be here speaking to [you]_p2942 as [I]_p2940 am now if [I]_p2940 did not believe [you]_p2943 clean grit, right through to the very depths of [your]_p2944 soul. Tell me, like one good fellow to another, is there any one else that [you]_p2945 care for? And if there is I'll never trouble [you]_p2946 a hair's breadth again, but will be, if [you]_p2946 will let me, a very faithful friend. ' ""My [dear]_n204 Mina, why are men so noble when [we]_p2948 women are so little worthy of them? Here was [I]_p2949 almost making fun of this great-hearted, true gentleman. [I]_p2950 burst into tears, [I]_p2951 am afraid, [my]_p2953 [dear]_n,205 [you]_p2954 will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one, and [I]_p2951 really felt very badly. Why can't [they]_p2955 let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and [I]_p2956 must not say it.",3,,49,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p2957 am glad to say that, though [I]_p2958 was crying, [I]_p2958 was able to look into Mr Morris's brave eyes, and [I]_p2959 told [him]_p2962 out straight:,   ""'Yes, there is some one [I]_p2959 love, though [he]_p2963 has not told [me]_p2965 yet that [he]_p2964 even loves me. ' [I]_p2967 was right to speak to [him]_p2970 so frankly, for quite a light came into [his]_p2971 face, and [he]_p2974 put out both [his]_p2972 hands and took mine, [I]_p2968 think [I]_p2968 put [them]_p2975 into his, and said in a hearty way:,   ""'That's [my]_p2976 brave girl.

[He]_p3000 stood up with [my]_p3001 two hands in his, and as [he]_p3003 looked down into [my]_p3002 face, [I]_p3005 am afraid [I]_p3006 was blushing very much, [he]_p3004 said:,   ""'Little girl, [I]_p3006 hold [your]_p3008 hand, and you've kissed me, and if these things don't make [us]_p3009 friends nothing ever will.

The valley is beautifully green, and [it]_p3104 is so steep that when [you]_p3106 are on the high land on either side [you]_p3107 look right across it, unless [you]_p3107 are near enough to see down. The houses of the old town, the side away from us, are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures [we]_p3109 see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby [Abbey]_n,236 which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of ""Marmion,"" where the girl was built up in the wall. [It]_p3110 is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between [it]_p3111 and the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to [my]_p3112 mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for [it]_p3113 lies right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called [Kettleness]_n237 stretches out into the sea. [It]_p3114 descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below.",2,,12,
stoker_dracula," There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. [I]_p3115 shall come and sit here very often [myself]_p3116 and work. Indeed, [I]_p3117 am writing now, with [my]_p3118 book on [my]_p3119 knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me. [They]_p3120 seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk. The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and [its]_p3121 end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens. [It]_p3122 is nice at high water but when the tide is out [it]_p3123 shoals away to nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse.",0,,9,
stoker_dracula," At the end of [it]_p3124 is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful sound on the wind. [They]_p3125 have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea. [I]_p3126 must ask the old man about this [he]_p3127 is coming this way. [He]_p3128 is a funny old man. [He]_p3129 must be awfully old, for [his]_p3130 face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. [He]_p3131 tells [me]_p3132 that [he]_p3133 is nearly a hundred, and that [he]_p3134 was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought. [He]_p3135 is, [I]_p3136 am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when [I]_p3137 asked [him]_p3139 about the bells at sea and the [White]_n238 Lady at the abbey [he]_p3140 said very brusquely:, ""I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss. [Them]_p3141 things be all wore out. Mind, [I]_p3142 don't say that [they]_p3144 never was, but [I]_p3143 do say that [they]_p3145 wasn't in [my]_p3146 time. [They]_p3147 be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like, but not for a nice [young]_n239 lady like you.",2,,23,
stoker_dracula," [Them]_p3148 feet-folks from [York]_n240 and Leeds that be always eatin' cured herrin's an' drinkin' tea an' lookin' out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. [I]_p3149 wonder masel' who'd be bothered tellin' lies to them, even the newspapers, which is full of fool-talk. "" [I]_p3150 thought [he]_p3152 would be a good person to learn interesting things from, so [I]_p3151 asked [him]_p3154 if [he]_p3153 would mind telling [me]_p3155 something about the whale-fishing in the old days. [He]_p3156 was just settling [himself]_p3157 to begin when the clock struck six, whereupon [he]_p3158 laboured to get up, and said:,   ""I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. [My]_p3159 grand-daughter doesn't like to be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for [it]_p3160 takes [me]_p3161 time to crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of 'em an', miss, [I]_p3162 lack belly-timber sairly by the clock. ""  [He]_p3163 hobbled away, and [I]_p3164 could see [him]_p3165 hurrying, as well as [he]_p3166 could, down the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. [They]_p3167 lead from the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them, [I]_p3168 do not know how many, and [they]_p3169 wind up in a delicate curve the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them. [I]_p3170 think [they]_p3171 must originally have had something to do with the abbey. [I]_p3172 shall go home too.",1,,25,
stoker_dracula," Lucy went out visiting with [her]_p3173 mother, and as [they]_p3174 were only duty calls, [I]_p3175 did not go. [They]_p3176 will be home by this. * * * * *  1 August. , [I]_p3177 came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and [we]_p3178 had a most interesting talk with [my]_p3179 old friend and the two others who always come and join him. [He]_p3180 is evidently the [Sir Oracle]_n241 of them, and [I]_p3181 should think must have been in [his]_p3182 time a most dictatorial person. [He]_p3183 will not admit anything, and downfaces everybody. If [he]_p3184 can't out-argue [them]_p3186 [he]_p3185 bullies them, and then takes [their]_p3188 silence for agreement with [his]_p3189 views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in [her]_p3190 white lawn frock [she]_p3191 has got a beautiful colour since [she]_p3192 has been here. [I]_p3193 noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near [her]_p3194 when [we]_p3195 sat down. [She]_p3196 is so sweet with old people [I]_p3197 think [they]_p3198 all fell in love with [her]_p3199 on the spot.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," Even [my]_p3200 old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but gave [me]_p3201 double share instead. [I]_p3202 got [him]_p3203 on the subject of the legends, and [he]_p3204 went off at once into a sort of sermon. [I]_p3205 must try to remember [it]_p3206 and put [it]_p3207 down:,   ""It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel that's what [it]_p3207 be, an' nowt else.

stoker_dracula," ""  [I]_p3239 could see from the old fellow's self-satisfied air and the way in which [he]_p3241 looked round for the approval of [his]_p3243 cronies that [he]_p3242 was ""showing off,"" so [I]_p3240 put in a word to keep [him]_p3244 going:,   ""Oh, Mr Swales, [you]_p3245 can't be serious.

To [my]_p3388 left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of a donkey's hoofs up the paved road below.

[He]_p3416 thought for a moment, and then said: ""May [I]_p3417 have three days? [I]_p3418 shall clear [them]_p3419 away. "" Of course, [I]_p3420 said that would do.

stoker_dracula," , [His]_p3430 spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as [his]_p3431 flies, and to-day [I]_p3432 told [him]_p3433 that [he]_p3434 must get rid of them. [He]_p3435 looked very sad at this, so [I]_p3436 said that [he]_p3437 must clear out some of them, at all events. [He]_p3438 cheerfully acquiesced in this, and [I]_p3439 gave [him]_p3440 the same time as before for reduction. [He]_p3441 disgusted [me]_p3442 much while with him, for when a horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, [he]_p3443 caught it, held [it]_p3445 exultantly for a few moments between [his]_p3449 finger and thumb, and, before [I]_p3451 knew what [he]_p3444 was going to do, put [it]_p3446 in [his]_p3450 mouth and ate it. [I]_p3452 scolded [him]_p3453 for it, but [he]_p3458 argued quietly that [it]_p3455 was very good and very wholesome that [it]_p3456 was life, strong life, and gave life to him. This gave [me]_p3459 an idea, or the rudiment of one. [I]_p3460 must watch how [he]_p3461 gets rid of [his]_p3462 spiders. [He]_p3463 has evidently some deep problem in [his]_p3464 mind, for [he]_p3465 keeps a little note-book in which [he]_p3466 is always jotting down something. Whole pages of [it]_p3467 are filled with masses of figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the totals added in batches again, as though [he]_p3469 were ""focussing"" some account, as the auditors put it. * * * * *  8 July.",0,,35,

Things remain as [they]_p3478 were except that [he]_p3479 has parted with some of [his]_p3480 pets and got a new one. [He]_p3481 has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. [His]_p3482 means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for [he]_p3483 still brings in the flies by tempting [them]_p3484 with [his]_p3485 food. * * * * *  19 July. , [We]_p3486 are progressing.

[I]_p3497 asked [him]_p3504 what [it]_p3506 was, and [he]_p3508 said, with a sort of rapture in [his]_p3510 voice and bearing:,   ""A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that [I]_p3498 can play with, and teach, and feed, and feed, and feed!"" [I]_p3498 was not unprepared for this request, for [I]_p3499 had noticed how [his]_p3511 pets went on increasing in size and vivacity, but [I]_p3499 did not care that [his]_p3511 pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders so [I]_p3499 said [I]_p3500 would see about it, and asked [him]_p3505 if [he]_p3509 would not rather have a cat than a kitten. [His]_p3513 eagerness betrayed [him]_p3514 as [he]_p3515 answered:,   ""Oh, yes, [I]_p3516 would like a cat! [I]_p3517 only asked for a kitten lest [you]_p3518 should refuse [me]_p3519 a cat. No one would refuse [me]_p3520 a kitten, would they?"" [I]_p3521 shook [my]_p3524 head, and said that at present [I]_p3522 feared [it]_p3525 would not be possible, but that [I]_p3522 would see about it. [His]_p3527 face fell, and [I]_p3528 could see a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, [sidelong]_n256 look which meant killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. [I]_p3529 shall test [him]_p3531 with [his]_p3532 present craving and see how [it]_p3533 will work out then [I]_p3530 shall know more. * * * * *  10 p. m. , [I]_p3534 have visited [him]_p3535 again and found [him]_p3536 sitting in a corner brooding.",1,,46,
stoker_dracula," When [I]_p3537 came in [he]_p3538 threw [himself]_p3539 on [his]_p3540 knees before [me]_p3542 and implored [me]_p3543 to let [him]_p3544 have a cat that [his]_p3541 salvation depended upon it. [I]_p3545 was firm, however, and told [him]_p3547 that [he]_p3549 could not have it, whereupon [he]_p3550 went without a word, and sat down, gnawing [his]_p3551 fingers, in the corner where [I]_p3546 had found him. [I]_p3552 shall see [him]_p3553 in the morning early. * * * * *  20 July. , [Visited]_n257 Renfield very early, before the attendant went [his]_p3554 rounds. [Found]_n258 [him]_p3555 up and humming a tune. [He]_p3556 was spreading out [his]_p3557 sugar, which [he]_p3559 had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning [his]_p3558 fly-catching again and beginning [it]_p3560 cheerfully and with a good grace. [I]_p3561 looked around for [his]_p3562 birds, and not seeing them, asked [him]_p3563 where [they]_p3564 were. [He]_p3565 replied, without turning round, that [they]_p3566 had all flown away. There were a few feathers about the room and on [his]_p3567 pillow a drop of blood.",2,,30,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p3568 said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to [me]_p3569 if there were anything odd about [him]_p3570 during the day. * * * * *  11 a. m. , The attendant has just been to [me]_p3571 to say that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. ""My belief is, doctor,"" [he]_p3572 said, ""that [he]_p3573 has eaten [his]_p3575 birds, and that [he]_p3573 just took and ate [them]_p3576 raw!""  * * * * *  11 p. m. , [I]_p3577 gave Renfield a strong opiate [to-night]_n,259 enough to make even [him]_p3578 sleep, and took away [his]_p3579 pocket-book to look at it. The thought that has been buzzing about [my]_p3580 brain lately is complete, and the theory proved. [My]_p3581 homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. [I]_p3582 shall have to invent a new classification for him, and call [him]_p3583 a zo phagous (life-eating) maniac what [he]_p3585 desires is to absorb as many lives as [he]_p3586 can, and [he]_p3586 has laid [himself]_p3588 out to achieve [it]_p3589 in a cumulative way.",1,,21,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p3590 gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been [his]_p3591 later steps? [It]_p3592 would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. [It]_p3593 might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at vivisection, and yet look at [its]_p3594 results to-day! Why not advance science in [its]_p3595 most difficult and vital aspect, the knowledge of the brain? Had [I]_p3596 even the secret of one such mind, did [I]_p3597 hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatic, [I]_p3597 might advance [my]_p3599 own branch of science to a pitch compared with which Burdon-Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient cause! [I]_p3600 must not think too much of this, or [I]_p3601 may be tempted a good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not [I]_p3601 too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?  How well the man reasoned lunatics always do within [their]_p3603 own scope. [I]_p3604 wonder at how many lives [he]_p3605 values a man, or if at only one. [He]_p3606 has closed the account most accurately, and [to-day]_n260 begun a new record. How many of [us]_p3607 begin a new record with each day of [our]_p3608 lives?  To [me]_p3609 [it]_p3610 seems only yesterday that [my]_p3611 whole life ended with [my]_p3612 new hope, and that truly [I]_p3613 began a new record. So [it]_p3614 will be until the Great [Recorder]_n261 sums [me]_p3615 up and closes [my]_p3616 ledger account with a balance to profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, [I]_p3617 cannot be angry with you, nor can [I]_p3618 be angry with [my]_p3620 friend whose happiness is [yours]_p3621 but [I]_p3618 must only wait on hopeless and work.",2,,32,

[I]_p3632 had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned but yesterday [dear]_n266 Mr Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent [me]_p3633 a letter from him. [I]_p3634 had written asking [him]_p3635 if [he]_p3636 had heard, and [he]_p3637 said the enclosed had just been received. [It]_p3638 is only a line dated from [Castle Dracula]_n,267 and says that [he]_p3639 is just starting for home.

Mrs Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. [Poor]_n268 [dear]_n,269 [she]_p3652 is naturally anxious about [Lucy]_n,270 and [she]_p3653 tells [me]_p3654 that [her]_p3655 husband, [Lucy]_n's271 father, had the same habit that [he]_p3656 would get up in the night and dress [himself]_p3658 and go out, if [he]_p3657 were not stopped. [Lucy]_n272 is to be married in the autumn, and [she]_p3659 is already planning out [her]_p3660 dresses and how [her]_p3661 house is to be arranged.

Lucy walks more than ever, and each night [I]_p3684 am awakened by [her]_p3685 moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so hot that [she]_p3686 cannot get cold but still the anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and [I]_p3687 am getting nervous and wakeful myself. Thank God, [Lucy]_n's281 health keeps up. Mr Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see [his]_p3688 father, who has been taken seriously ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but [it]_p3689 does not touch [her]_p3690 looks [she]_p3692 is a trifle stouter, and [her]_p3691 cheeks are a lovely rose-pink.

Everything is grey, except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst [it]_p3720 grey earthy rock  grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland.",3,,8,
stoker_dracula," The horizon is lost in a grey mist. All is vastness the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a ""brool"" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.

"" The fishing-boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as [they]_p3721 sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr Swales. [He]_p3722 is making straight for me, and [I]_p3723 can see, by the way [he]_p3724 lifts [his]_p3726 hat, that [he]_p3725 wants to talk. [I]_p3727 have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When [he]_p3728 sat down beside me, [he]_p3729 said in a very gentle way:,   ""I want to say something to you, miss. "" [I]_p3730 could see [he]_p3738 was not at ease, so [I]_p3731 took [his]_p3740 poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked [him]_p3742 to speak fully so [he]_p3739 said, leaving [his]_p3741 hand in mine:,   ""I'm afraid, [my]_p3743 deary, that [I]_p3731 must have shocked [you]_p3744 by all the wicked things I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past  but [I]_p3732 didn't mean them, and [I]_p3732 want [ye]_p3745 to remember that when I'm gone.

[Whitby]_n291. One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to [Mulgrave]_n292 Woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers Emma and Scarborough made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of ""tripping"" both to and from [Whitby]_n293. The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the [East Cliff]_n294 churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of ""mares'-tails"" high in the sky to the north-west.",7,,3,
stoker_dracula," The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked ""No. 2: light breeze. "" The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the [East Cliff]_n,295 foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in [its]_p3806 masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black mass of [Kettleness]_n,296 standing boldly athwart the western sky, [its]_p3807 downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour, flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the ""Prelude to the Great Storm"" will grace the R. A. and R. I. walls in May next.",2,,2,
stoker_dracula," More than one captain made up [his]_p3808 mind then and there that [his]_p3809 ""cobble"" or [his]_p3809 ""mule,"" as [they]_p3811 term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed. The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually ""hug"" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of [her]_p3812 officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst [she]_p3815 remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal [her]_p3813 to reduce sail in face of [her]_p3813 danger. Before the night shut down [she]_p3816 was seen with sails idly flapping as [she]_p3817 gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,  ""As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean. ""  Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with [its]_p3818 lively French air, was like a discord in the great harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming. Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed.",0,,11,
stoker_dracula," The waves rose in growing fury, each overtopping [its]_p3819 fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster. [White]_n-crested297 waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs others broke over the piers, and with [their]_p3820 spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that [it]_p3821 was with difficulty that even strong men kept [their]_p3822 feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. [It]_p3823 was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland, white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that [it]_p3824 needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching [their]_p3825 living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm. Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest, the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space here and there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the [East Cliff]_n298 the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried. The officers in charge of [it]_p3826 got [it]_p3827 into working order, and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with [it]_p3827 the surface of the sea. Once or twice [its]_p3829 service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers.",2,,11,
stoker_dracula," As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in [its]_p3830 rush. Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as [they]_p3831 realized the terrible danger in which [she]_p3832 now was. Between [her]_p3833 and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from [its]_p3834 present quarter, [it]_p3835 would be quite impossible that [she]_p3836 should fetch the entrance of the harbour. [It]_p3837 was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in [their]_p3838 troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, ""she must fetch up somewhere, if [it]_p3839 was only in hell. "" Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto, a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the [East]_n299 Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the blast and then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as [it]_p3840 rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all.",1,,11,
stoker_dracula," A great awe came on all as [they]_p3841 realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However, all took place more quickly than [it]_p3842 takes to write these words. The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched [herself]_p3843 on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the [East Cliff]_n,300 known locally as Tate [Hill]_n301 [Pier]_n302. There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the ""top-hammer"" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the [East]_n303 Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones, ""thruff-steans"" or ""through-stones,"" as [they]_p3844 call [them]_p3845 in the Whitby vernacular, actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, [it]_p3846 disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight. [It]_p3847 so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept [it]_p3848 there. The coastguard ran aft, and when [he]_p3849 came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion.",4,,9,
stoker_dracula," This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. [It]_p3850 is a good way round from the West [Cliff]_n304 by the [Drawbridge]_n305 to Tate Hill Pier, but [your]_p3851 correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd. When [I]_p3852 arrived, however, [I]_p3853 found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the courtesy of the chief boatman, [I]_p3854 was, as [your]_p3855 correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel. [It]_p3856 was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened by [his]_p3857 hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which [it]_p3858 was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged [him]_p3859 to and fro, so that the cords with which [he]_p3860 was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor, [Surgeon J]_n306. M.",3,,11,
stoker_dracula," Caffyn, of 33, [East Elliot Place]_n,307 who came immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In [his]_p3861 pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said the man must have tied up [his]_p3862 own hands, fastening the knots with [his]_p3863 teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one [young]_n308 law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, [his]_p3864 property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead hand. [It]_p3865 is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where [he]_p3866 held [his]_p3867 honourable watch and ward till death, a steadfastness as noble as that of the [young]_n309 Casabianca, and placed in the mortuary to await inquest. Already the sudden storm is passing, and [its]_p3868 fierceness is abating  crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds. [I]_p3869 shall send, in time for [your]_p3870 next issue, further details of the derelict ship which found [her]_p3871 way so miraculously into harbour in the storm. [Whitby]_n310 9 August. , The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself.",4,,11,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p3872 turns out that the schooner is a Russian from [Varna]_n,311 and is called the Demeter. [She]_p3873 is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo, a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould. This cargo was consigned to a [Whitby]_n312 solicitor, [Mr S]_n313. F. [Billington]_n,314 of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except the strange coincidence the officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations. As the matter is to be a ""nine days' wonder,"" [they]_p3874 are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S. P.",4,,3,
stoker_dracula," C. A. , which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal. To the general disappointment, however, [it]_p3875 was not to be found  [it]_p3876 seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. [It]_p3877 may be that [it]_p3878 was frightened and made [its]_p3880 way on to the moors, where [it]_p3879 is still hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on [it]_p3881 should in [itself]_p3883 become a danger, for [it]_p3882 is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate [Hill]_n315 [Pier]_n,316 was found dead in the roadway opposite to [its]_p3884 master's yard. [It]_p3885 had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for [its]_p3886 throat was torn away, and [its]_p3887 belly was slit open as if with a savage claw. * * * * *  Later. , By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, [I]_p3888 have been permitted to look over the log-book of the Demeter, which was in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men.",2,,14,
stoker_dracula," The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced at the inquest and a more strange narrative than the two between [them]_p3889 unfold [it]_p3890 has not been [my]_p3891 lot to come across. As there is no motive for concealment, [I]_p3892 am permitted to use them, and accordingly send [you]_p3893 a rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo. [It]_p3894 almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before [he]_p3895 had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course [my]_p3896 statement must be taken cum grano, since [I]_p3897 am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short. LOG OF THE ""DEMETER. "" [Varna]_n317 to [Whitby]_n318. Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that [I]_p3898 shall keep accurate note henceforth till [we]_p3899 land. * * * * *  On 6 July [we]_p3900 finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth. At noon set sail. [East]_n319 wind, fresh.",3,,12,
stoker_dracula," Crew, five hands. two mates, cook, and [myself]_p3901 (captain). * * * * *  On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m. * * * * *  On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of guarding squadron.",0,,1,
stoker_dracula," Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but quick. Want [us]_p3902 off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago. * * * * * On 13 July passed [Cape Matapan]_n320. Crew dissatisfied about something. Seemed scared, but would not speak out. * * * * *  On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who sailed with [me]_p3903 before. Mate could not make out what was wrong [they]_p3904 only told [him]_p3905 there was something, and crossed themselves.",1,,4,
stoker_dracula," Mate lost temper with one of [them]_p3906 that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet. * * * * * On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, [Petrofsky]_n,321 was missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last night was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more downcast than ever. All said [they]_p3907 expected something of the kind, but would not say more than there was something aboard. Mate getting very impatient with [them]_p3908 feared some trouble ahead. * * * * *  On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to [my]_p3909 cabin, and in an awestruck way confided to [me]_p3910 that [he]_p3911 thought there was a strange man aboard the ship. [He]_p3912 said that in [his]_p3913 watch [he]_p3914 had been sheltering behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when [he]_p3915 saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way, and go along the deck forward, and disappear.",1,,10,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p3916 followed cautiously, but when [he]_p3917 got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed. [He]_p3918 was in a panic of superstitious fear, and [I]_p3919 am afraid the panic may spread. To allay it, [I]_p3920 shall to-day search entire ship carefully from stem to stern. * * * * *  Later in the day [I]_p3921 got together the whole crew, and told them, as [they]_p3922 evidently thought there was some one in the ship, [we]_p3923 would search from stem to stern. First mate angry said [it]_p3924 was folly, and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men said [he]_p3925 would engage to keep [them]_p3926 out of trouble with a handspike. [I]_p3927 let [him]_p3928 take the helm, while the rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: [we]_p3929 left no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but said nothing. * * * * *  22 July.",0,,14,
stoker_dracula," , Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with sails, no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten [their]_p3930 dread. Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well. * * * * *  24 July. , There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short, and entering on the [Bay]_n322 of [Biscay]_n323 with wild weather ahead, and yet last night another man lost, disappeared. Like the first, [he]_p3931 came off [his]_p3932 watch and was not seen again.",2,,3,
stoker_dracula," Men all in a panic of fear sent a round robin, asking to have double watch, as [they]_p3933 fear to be alone. Mate angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either [he]_p3934 or the men will do some violence. * * * * *  28 July. , [Four]_n324 days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom, and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours' sleep. [Wind]_n325 abating seas still terrific, but feel [them]_p3935 less, as ship is steadier.",2,,3,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  29 July. , Another tragedy. Had single watch [to-night]_n,326 as crew too tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search, but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate and [I]_p3936 agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause. * * * * *  30 July. , Last night.",1,,1,
stoker_dracula," Rejoiced [we]_p3937 are nearing England. Weather fine, all sails set. Retired worn out slept soundly awaked by mate telling [me]_p3938 that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and two hands left to work ship. * * * * *  1 August. , Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in the [English Channel]_n327 to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere. Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower, as could not raise [them]_p3939 again. [We]_p3940 seem to be drifting to some terrible doom.",1,,4,
stoker_dracula," Mate now more demoralised than either of men. [His]_p3941 stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. [They]_p3942 are Russian, [he]_p3943 Roumanian. * * * * *  2 August, midnight. , Woke up from few minutes' sleep by hearing a cry, seemingly outside [my]_p3944 port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and ran against mate. Tells [me]_p3945 heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on watch. One more gone.",0,,5,
stoker_dracula," Lord, help us! Mate says [we]_p3946 must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting [he]_p3947 saw North Foreland, just as [he]_p3948 heard the man cry out. If so [we]_p3949 are now off in the [North Sea]_n,328 and only God can guide [us]_p3950 in the fog, which seems to move with [us]_p3951 and God seems to have deserted us. * * * * *  3 August. , At midnight [I]_p3953 went to relieve the man at the wheel, and when [I]_p3954 got to [it]_p3955 found no one there. The wind was steady, and as [we]_p3956 ran before [it]_p3957 there was no yawing. [I]_p3958 dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate. After a few seconds [he]_p3959 rushed up on deck in [his]_p3960 flannels. [He]_p3961 looked wild-eyed and haggard, and [I]_p3962 greatly fear [his]_p3963 reason has given way. [He]_p3964 came close to [me]_p3965 and whispered hoarsely, with [his]_p3966 mouth to [my]_p3967 ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: ""It is here [I]_p3968 know it, now. On the watch last night [I]_p3969 saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale.",1,,23,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p3970 was in the bows, and looking out. [I]_p3971 crept behind It, and gave [It]_p3972 [my]_p3975 knife but the knife went through It, empty as the air. "" And as [he]_p3976 spoke [he]_p3977 took [his]_p3978 knife and drove [it]_p3979 savagely into space. Then [he]_p3980 went on: ""But [It]_p3981 is here, and I'll find It. [It]_p3983 is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll unscrew [them]_p3984 one by one and see. [You]_p3985 work the helm. "" And, with a warning look and [his]_p3986 finger on [his]_p3987 lip, [he]_p3988 went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and [I]_p3989 could not leave the helm. [I]_p3990 saw [him]_p3991 come out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway.",0,,19,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p3992 is mad, stark, raving mad, and it's no use [my]_p3993 trying to stop him. [He]_p3994 can't hurt those big boxes: [they]_p3995 are invoiced as ""clay,"" and to pull [them]_p3996 about is as harmless a thing as [he]_p3997 can do. So here [I]_p3998 stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes. [I]_p3999 can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears. Then, if [I]_p4000 can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is, [I]_p4001 shall cut down sails and lie by, and signal for help. * * * * *  [It]_p4002 is nearly all over now. Just as [I]_p4003 was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer, for [I]_p4004 heard [him]_p4005 knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him, there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled scream, which made [my]_p4007 blood run cold, and up on the deck [he]_p4008 came as if shot from a gun, a raging madman, with [his]_p4009 eyes rolling and [his]_p4010 face convulsed with fear. ""Save me! save me!"" [he]_p4011 cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog. [His]_p4012 horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice [he]_p4013 said: ""You had better come too, captain, before [it]_p4014 is too late. [He]_p4015 is there.",0,,23,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p4016 know the secret now. The sea will save [me]_p4017 from [Him]_n,329 and [it]_p4018 is all that is left!"" Before [I]_p4019 could say a word, or move forward to seize him, [he]_p4020 sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw [himself]_p4021 into the sea. [I]_p4022 suppose [I]_p4023 know the secret too, now. [It]_p4024 was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now [he]_p4025 has followed [them]_p4026 himself. God help me! How am [I]_p4027 to account for all these horrors when [I]_p4028 get to port? When [I]_p4028 get to port! Will that ever be?  * * * * *  4 August. , Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. [I]_p4030 know there is sunrise because [I]_p4031 am a sailor, why else [I]_p4031 know not. [I]_p4033 dared not go below, [I]_p4034 dared not leave the helm so here all night [I]_p4034 stayed, and in the dimness of the night [I]_p4035 saw It, [Him]_n!330 God forgive me, but the mate was right to jump overboard. [It]_p4037 was better to die like a man to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object. But [I]_p4038 am captain, and [I]_p4039 must not leave [my]_p4040 ship.",2,,25,
stoker_dracula," But [I]_p4041 shall baffle this fiend or monster, for [I]_p4042 shall tie [my]_p4045 hands to the wheel when [my]_p4046 strength begins to fail, and along with [them]_p4049 [I]_p4042 shall tie that which He, It!, dare not touch and then, come good wind or foul, [I]_p4043 shall save [my]_p4046 soul, and [my]_p4047 honour as a captain. [I]_p4050 am growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If [He]_p4051 can look [me]_p4052 in the face again, [I]_p4053 may not have time to act. If [we]_p4054 are wrecked, mayhap this bottle may be found, and those who find [it]_p4055 may understand if not,. well, then all men shall know that [I]_p4056 have been true to [my]_p4057 trust. God and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do [his]_p4058 duty. * * * * *  Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce  and whether or not the man [himself]_p4059 committed the murders there is now none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero, and [he]_p4060 is to be given a public funeral. Already [it]_p4061 is arranged that [his]_p4062 body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps for [he]_p4063 is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff.",0,,23,
stoker_dracula," The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in [their]_p4064 names as wishing to follow [him]_p4065 to the grave. No trace has ever been found of the great dog at which there is much mourning, for, with public opinion in [its]_p4066 present state, [he]_p4067 would, [I]_p4068 believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral and so will end this one more ""mystery of the sea. "" [Mina Murray]_n's331 [Journal]_n332. 8 August. , [Lucy]_n333 was very restless all night, and I, too, could not sleep. The storm was fearful, and as [it]_p4069 boomed loudly among the chimney-pots, [it]_p4070 made [me]_p4071 shudder. When a sharp puff came [it]_p4072 seemed to be like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake but [she]_p4073 got up twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time [I]_p4074 awoke in time and managed to undress [her]_p4075 without waking her, and got [her]_p4076 back to bed.",3,,13,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p4078 is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as [her]_p4079 will is thwarted in any physical way, [her]_p4080 intention, if there be any, disappears, and [she]_p4082 yields [herself]_p4083 almost exactly to the routine of [her]_p4080 life. Early in the morning [we]_p4084 both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark [themselves]_p4085 because the foam that topped [them]_p4087 was like snow, forced [themselves]_p4086 in through the narrow mouth of the harbour, like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow [I]_p4088 felt glad that [Jonathan]_n334 was not on the sea last night, but on land. But, oh, is [he]_p4089 on land or sea? Where is he, and how? [I]_p4091 am getting fearfully anxious about him. If [I]_p4092 only knew what to do, and could do anything!  * * * * *  10 August. , The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from [Tate Hill Pier]_n335 up to the churchyard. Lucy came with me, and [we]_p4093 went early to [our]_p4094 old seat, whilst the cort ge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again. [We]_p4095 had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.",2,,17,
stoker_dracula," The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near [our]_p4096 seat so that [we]_p4097 stood on [it]_p4098 when the time came and saw everything. [Poor Lucy]_n336 seemed much upset. [She]_p4099 was restless and uneasy all the time, and [I]_p4100 cannot but think that [her]_p4101 dreaming at night is telling on her. [She]_p4103 is quite odd in one thing: [she]_p4104 will not admit to [me]_p4106 that there is any cause for restlessness or if there be, [she]_p4105 does not understand [it]_p4107 herself. There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr Swales was found dead this morning on [our]_p4108 seat, [his]_p4109 neck being broken. [He]_p4110 had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on [his]_p4111 face that the men said made [them]_p4112 shudder. [Poor]_n337 [dear]_n338 old man! Perhaps [he]_p4113 had seen Death with [his]_p4114 dying eyes! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that [she]_p4115 feels influences more acutely than other people do. Just now [she]_p4116 was quite upset by a little thing which [I]_p4117 did not much heed, though [I]_p4118 am [myself]_p4119 very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by [his]_p4120 dog. The dog is always with him.",3,,24,
stoker_dracula," [They]_p4121 are both quiet persons, and [I]_p4122 never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would not come to [its]_p4123 master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling. [Its]_p4124 master spoke to [it]_p4125 gently, and then harshly, and then angrily but [it]_p4126 would neither come nor cease to make a noise. [It]_p4127 was in a sort of fury, with [its]_p4128 eyes savage, and all [its]_p4129 hairs bristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took [it]_p4130 by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw [it]_p4131 on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment [it]_p4132 touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. [It]_p4133 did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that [I]_p4134 tried, though without effect, to comfort it. [Lucy]_n339 was full of pity, too, but [she]_p4135 did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at [it]_p4136 in an agonised sort of way. [I]_p4137 greatly fear that [she]_p4138 is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble. [She]_p4139 will be dreaming of this [to-night]_n,340 [I]_p4140 am sure.",2,,20,
stoker_dracula," The whole agglomeration of things, the ship steered into port by a dead man [his]_p4141 attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads the touching funeral the dog, now furious and now in terror, will all afford material for [her]_p4142 dreams. [I]_p4143 think [it]_p4145 will be best for [her]_p4146 to go to bed tired out physically, so [I]_p4144 shall take [her]_p4147 for a long walk by the cliffs to [Robin Hood]_n's341 [Bay]_n342 and back. [She]_p4148 ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then. CHAPTER VIII  MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL   Same day, 11 o'clock p. m. , Oh, but [I]_p4149 am tired! If [it]_p4152 were not that [I]_p4150 had made [my]_p4154 diary a duty [I]_p4150 should not open [it]_p4153 [to-night]_n343. [We]_p4155 had a lovely walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, [I]_p4156 think, to some [dear]_n344 cows who came nosing towards [us]_p4157 in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. [I]_p4159 believe [we]_p4160 forgot everything except, of course, personal fear, and [it]_p4161 seemed to wipe the slate clean and give [us]_p4162 a fresh start. [We]_p4163 had a capital ""severe tea"" at [Robin Hood]_n's345 [Bay]_n346 in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand.",6,,22,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p4164 believe [we]_p4165 should have shocked the ""[New Woman]_n""347 with [our]_p4166 appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless them! Then [we]_p4167 walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with [our]_p4168 hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was really tired, and [we]_p4169 intended to creep off to bed as soon as [we]_p4170 could. The [young]_n348 curate came in, however, and Mrs Westenra asked [him]_p4171 to stay for supper. [Lucy]_n349 and [I]_p4172 had both a fight for [it]_p4175 with the dusty miller [I]_p4173 know [it]_p4176 was a hard fight on [my]_p4177 part, and [I]_p4173 am quite heroic. [I]_p4178 think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how [they]_p4179 may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. [Lucy]_n350 is asleep and breathing softly. [She]_p4180 has more colour in [her]_p4181 cheeks than usual, and looks, oh, so sweet. If [Mr Holmwood]_n351 fell in love with [her]_p4182 seeing [her]_p4183 only in the drawing-room, [I]_p4185 wonder what [he]_p4186 would say if [he]_p4187 saw [her]_p4183 now. Some of the ""[New Women]_n""352 writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting.",6,,24,
stoker_dracula," But [I]_p4188 suppose the New Woman won't condescend in future to accept [she]_p4189 will do the proposing herself. And a nice job [she]_p4190 will make of it, too! There's some consolation in that. [I]_p4191 am so happy [to-night]_n,353 because [dear]_n354 [Lucy]_n355 seems better. [I]_p4192 really believe [she]_p4193 has turned the corner, and that [we]_p4194 are over [her]_p4195 troubles with dreaming. [I]_p4196 should be quite happy if [I]_p4197 only knew if [Jonathan]_n356. God bless and keep him. * * * * *  11 August, 3 a. m. , [Diary]_n357 again. No sleep now, so [I]_p4198 may as well write.",5,,11,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p4199 am too agitated to sleep. [We]_p4200 have had such an adventure, such an agonising experience. [I]_p4201 fell asleep as soon as [I]_p4202 had closed [my]_p4203 diary. Suddenly [I]_p4204 became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so [I]_p4205 could not see [Lucy]_n's358 bed [I]_p4206 stole across and felt for her. The bed was empty. [I]_p4207 lit a match and found that [she]_p4208 was not in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as [I]_p4209 had left it. [I]_p4210 feared to wake [her]_p4211 mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her. As [I]_p4213 was leaving the room [it]_p4214 struck [me]_p4215 that the clothes [she]_p4217 wore might give [me]_p4216 some clue to [her]_p4218 dreaming intention.",1,,19,
stoker_dracula," Dressing-gown would mean house dress, outside. Dressing-gown and dress were both in [their]_p4219 places. ""Thank God,"" [I]_p4220 said to myself, ""she cannot be far, as [she]_p4221 is only in [her]_p4223 nightdress. "" [I]_p4224 ran downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then [I]_p4225 looked in all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling [my]_p4226 heart. Finally [I]_p4227 came to the hall door and found [it]_p4228 open. [It]_p4229 was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so [I]_p4230 feared that [Lucy]_n359 must have gone out as [she]_p4231 was. There was no time to think of what might happen a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. [I]_p4232 took a big, heavy shawl and ran out.",1,,13,
stoker_dracula," The clock was striking one as [I]_p4233 was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. [I]_p4234 ran along the [North Terrace]_n,360 but could see no sign of the white figure which [I]_p4235 expected. At the edge of the [West Cliff]_n361 above the pier [I]_p4236 looked across the harbour to the [East Cliff]_n,362 in the hope or fear, [I]_p4237 don't know which, of seeing [Lucy]_n363 in [our]_p4238 favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as [they]_p4239 sailed across. For a moment or two [I]_p4240 could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured [St]_n364. Mary's Church and all around it. Then as the cloud passed [I]_p4241 could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible. Whatever [my]_p4242 expectation was, [it]_p4243 was not disappointed, for there, on [our]_p4244 favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too quick for [me]_p4245 to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately but [it]_p4247 seemed to [me]_p4246 as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What [it]_p4249 was, whether man or beast, [I]_p4250 could not tell [I]_p4251 did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the [East Cliff]_n365.",6,,18,
stoker_dracula," The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did [I]_p4252 see [I]_p4253 rejoiced that [it]_p4255 was so, for [I]_p4253 wanted no witness of [poor Lucy]_n's366 condition. The time and distance seemed endless, and [my]_p4256 knees trembled and [my]_p4257 breath came laboured as [I]_p4258 toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. [I]_p4259 must have gone fast, and yet [it]_p4260 seemed to [me]_p4261 as if [my]_p4262 feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in [my]_p4263 body were rusty. When [I]_p4264 got almost to the top [I]_p4265 could see the seat and the white figure, for [I]_p4265 was now close enough to distinguish [it]_p4267 even through the spells of shadow. There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure. [I]_p4268 called in fright, ""[Lucy]_n!367 [Lucy]_n!""368 and something raised a head, and from where [I]_p4269 was [I]_p4269 could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and [I]_p4271 ran on to the entrance of the churchyard. As [I]_p4272 entered, the church was between [me]_p4274 and the seat, and for a minute or so [I]_p4273 lost sight of her. When [I]_p4275 came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that [I]_p4276 could see Lucy half reclining with [her]_p4277 head lying over the back of the seat. [She]_p4278 was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.",3,,27,
stoker_dracula," When [I]_p4279 bent over [her]_p4281 [I]_p4280 could see that [she]_p4282 was still asleep. [Her]_p4283 lips were parted, and [she]_p4284 was breathing, not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get [her]_p4285 lungs full at every breath. As [I]_p4287 came close, [she]_p4288 put up [her]_p4289 hand in [her]_p4290 sleep and pulled the collar of [her]_p4290 nightdress close around [her]_p4291 throat. Whilst [she]_p4293 did so there came a little shudder through her, as though [she]_p4294 felt the cold. [I]_p4295 flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round [her]_p4297 neck, for [I]_p4296 dreaded lest [she]_p4299 should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as [she]_p4300 was. [I]_p4301 feared to wake [her]_p4305 all at once, so, in order to have [my]_p4312 hands free that [I]_p4302 might help her, [I]_p4302 fastened the shawl at [her]_p4306 throat with a big safety-pin but [I]_p4303 must have been clumsy in [my]_p4313 anxiety and pinched or pricked [her]_p4306 with it, for by-and-by, when [her]_p4307 breathing became quieter, [she]_p4314 put [her]_p4307 hand to [her]_p4307 throat again and moaned. When [I]_p4315 had [her]_p4317 carefully wrapped up [I]_p4316 put [my]_p4320 shoes on [her]_p4318 feet and then began very gently to wake her. At first [she]_p4321 did not respond but gradually [she]_p4322 became more and more uneasy in [her]_p4323 sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other reasons, [I]_p4324 wished to get [her]_p4326 home at once, [I]_p4325 shook [her]_p4327 more forcibly, till finally [she]_p4329 opened [her]_p4327 eyes and awoke. [She]_p4330 did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, [she]_p4331 did not realise all at once where [she]_p4332 was.",0,,50,
stoker_dracula," Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when [her]_p4333 body must have been chilled with cold, and [her]_p4334 mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, [she]_p4336 did not lose [her]_p4334 grace. [She]_p4337 trembled a little, and clung to [me]_p4338 when [I]_p4340 told [her]_p4341 to come at once with [me]_p4339 home [she]_p4342 rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As [we]_p4343 passed along, the gravel hurt [my]_p4344 feet, and [Lucy]_n369 noticed [me]_p4345 wince. [She]_p4346 stopped and wanted to insist upon [my]_p4347 taking [my]_p4348 shoes but [I]_p4349 would not. However, when [we]_p4350 got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, [I]_p4353 daubed [my]_p4354 feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as [we]_p4351 went home, no one, in case [we]_p4351 should meet any one, should notice [my]_p4355 bare feet. Fortune favoured us, and [we]_p4356 got home without meeting a soul. Once [we]_p4357 saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of [us]_p4359 but [we]_p4358 hid in a door till [he]_p4360 had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or ""wynds,"" as [they]_p4361 call [them]_p4362 in Scotland. [My]_p4363 heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes [I]_p4364 thought [I]_p4365 should faint. [I]_p4366 was filled with anxiety about [Lucy]_n,370 not only for [her]_p4367 health, lest [she]_p4369 should suffer from the exposure, but for [her]_p4368 reputation in case the story should get wind. When [we]_p4370 got in, and had washed [our]_p4371 feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, [I]_p4372 tucked [her]_p4373 into bed.",2,,41,
stoker_dracula," Before falling asleep [she]_p4374 asked, even implored, [me]_p4375 not to say a word to any one, even [her]_p4376 mother, about [her]_p4377 sleep-walking adventure. [I]_p4378 hesitated at first to promise but on thinking of the state of [her]_p4380 mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted, nay, infallibly would, in case [it]_p4382 should leak out, [I]_p4379 thought [it]_p4383 wiser to do so. [I]_p4384 hope [I]_p4385 did right. [I]_p4386 have locked the door, and the key is tied to [my]_p4388 wrist, so perhaps [I]_p4387 shall not be again disturbed. [Lucy]_n371 is sleeping soundly the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea. * * * * *  Same day, noon. , All goes well. Lucy slept till [I]_p4389 woke [her]_p4390 and seemed not to have even changed [her]_p4391 side. The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed [her]_p4392 on the contrary, [it]_p4394 has benefited her, for [she]_p4395 looks better this morning than [she]_p4396 has done for weeks. [I]_p4397 was sorry to notice that [my]_p4398 clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her.",1,,23,
stoker_dracula," Indeed, [it]_p4399 might have been serious, for the skin of [her]_p4400 throat was pierced. [I]_p4401 must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of [her]_p4402 nightdress was a drop of blood. When [I]_p4403 apologised and was concerned about it, [she]_p4404 laughed and petted me, and said [she]_p4405 did not even feel it. Fortunately [it]_p4406 cannot leave a scar, as [it]_p4407 is so tiny. * * * * *  Same day, night. , [We]_p4408 passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. [We]_p4409 took [our]_p4410 lunch to [Mulgrave]_n372 Woods, Mrs Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and [I]_p4411 walking by the cliff-path and joining [her]_p4412 at the gate. [I]_p4413 felt a little sad myself, for [I]_p4414 could not but feel how absolutely happy [it]_p4415 would have been had Jonathan been with me. But there! [I]_p4416 must only be patient.",1,,18,
stoker_dracula," In the evening [we]_p4417 strolled in the [Casino Terrace]_n,373 and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than [she]_p4418 has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. [I]_p4419 shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before, though [I]_p4420 do not expect any trouble [to-night]_n374. * * * * *  12 August. , [My]_p4421 expectations were wrong, for twice during the night [I]_p4422 was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. [She]_p4423 seemed, even in [her]_p4424 sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of protest. [I]_p4425 woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, [I]_p4426 was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning. All [her]_p4427 old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and [she]_p4428 came and snuggled in beside [me]_p4429 and told [me]_p4430 all about [Arthur]_n375. [I]_p4431 told [her]_p4433 how anxious [I]_p4432 was about Jonathan, and then [she]_p4434 tried to comfort me.",3,,18,
stoker_dracula," Well, [she]_p4435 succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can't alter facts, [it]_p4436 can help to make [them]_p4437 more bearable. * * * * *  13 August. , Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on [my]_p4438 wrist as before. Again [I]_p4439 awoke in the night, and found [Lucy]_n376 sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window. [I]_p4440 got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out. [It]_p4441 was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky, merged together in one great, silent mystery, was beautiful beyond words. Between [me]_p4442 and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or twice [it]_p4443 came quite close, but was, [I]_p4444 suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When [I]_p4445 came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully. [She]_p4446 did not stir again all night.",1,,12,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  14 August. , On the [East Cliff]_n,377 reading and writing all day. Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as [I]_p4447 am, and [it]_p4448 is hard to get [her]_p4451 away from [it]_p4449 when [it]_p4449 is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner. This afternoon [she]_p4452 made a funny remark. [We]_p4453 were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the [West Pier]_n378 and stopped to look at the view, as [we]_p4454 generally do. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind [Kettleness]_n379 the red light was thrown over on the [East Cliff]_n380 and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow. [We]_p4455 were silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:,   ""His red eyes again! [They]_p4456 are just the same. "" [It]_p4457 was such an odd expression, coming apropos of nothing, that [it]_p4458 quite startled me. [I]_p4459 slewed round a little, so as to see [Lucy]_n381 well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that [she]_p4465 was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on [her]_p4462 face that [I]_p4460 could not quite make out so [I]_p4460 said nothing, but followed [her]_p4463 eyes. [She]_p4466 appeared to be looking over at [our]_p4467 own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone.",5,,20,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p4468 was a little startled myself, for [it]_p4469 seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of [St]_n382. Mary's Church behind [our]_p4470 seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make [it]_p4471 appear as if the light moved. [I]_p4472 called Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and [she]_p4473 became [herself]_p4476 with a start, but [she]_p4474 looked sad all the same [it]_p4477 may have been that [she]_p4474 was thinking of that terrible night up there. [We]_p4478 never refer to [it]_p4479 so [I]_p4480 said nothing, and [we]_p4481 went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went early to bed. [I]_p4482 saw [her]_p4485 asleep, and went out for a little stroll [myself]_p4486  [I]_p4483 walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for [I]_p4483 was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home, [it]_p4487 was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of [our]_p4488 part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen, [I]_p4490 threw a glance up at [our]_p4489 window, and saw Lucy's head leaning out. [I]_p4491 thought that perhaps [she]_p4493 was looking out for me, so [I]_p4492 opened [my]_p4494 handkerchief and waved it. [She]_p4495 did not notice or make any movement whatever.",1,,28,
stoker_dracula," Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window. There distinctly was [Lucy]_n383 with [her]_p4496 head lying up against the side of the window-sill and [her]_p4497 eyes shut. [She]_p4498 was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird. [I]_p4499 was afraid [she]_p4502 might get a chill, so [I]_p4500 ran upstairs, but as [I]_p4500 came into the room [she]_p4503 was moving back to [her]_p4505 bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily [she]_p4503 was holding [her]_p4506 hand to [her]_p4506 throat, as though to protect [it]_p4508 from cold. [I]_p4509 did not wake her, but tucked [her]_p4511 up warmly [I]_p4510 have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened. [She]_p4513 looks so sweet as [she]_p4514 sleeps but [she]_p4515 is paler than is [her]_p4516 wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under [her]_p4517 eyes which [I]_p4518 do not like. [I]_p4519 fear [she]_p4520 is fretting about something. [I]_p4521 wish [I]_p4522 could find out what [it]_p4523 is. * * * * *  15 August. , Rose later than usual.",1,,27,
stoker_dracula," Lucy was languid and tired, and slept on after [we]_p4524 had been called. [We]_p4525 had a happy surprise at breakfast. [Arthur]_n's384 father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. [Lucy]_n385 is full of quiet joy, and [her]_p4526 mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on in the day [she]_p4527 told [me]_p4528 the cause. [She]_p4529 is grieved to lose [Lucy]_n386 as [her]_p4530 very own, but [she]_p4532 is rejoiced that [she]_p4533 is soon to have some one to protect her. [Poor]_n387 [dear]_n,388 sweet lady! [She]_p4534 confided to [me]_p4535 that [she]_p4536 has got [her]_p4537 death-warrant. [She]_p4538 has not told Lucy, and made [me]_p4539 promise secrecy  [her]_p4540 doctor told [her]_p4541 that within a few months, at most, [she]_p4543 must die, for [her]_p4541 heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her. Ah, [we]_p4544 were wise to keep from [her]_p4545 the affair of the dreadful night of [Lucy]_n's389 sleep-walking.",6,,21,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  17 August. , No diary for two whole days. [I]_p4546 have not had the heart to write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over [our]_p4547 happiness. No news from Jonathan, and [Lucy]_n390 seems to be growing weaker, whilst [her]_p4548 mother's hours are numbering to a close. [I]_p4549 do not understand [Lucy]_n's391 fading away as [she]_p4550 is doing. [She]_p4551 eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air but all the time the roses in [her]_p4552 cheeks are fading, and [she]_p4554 gets weaker and more languid day by day at night [I]_p4555 hear [her]_p4553 gasping as if for air. [I]_p4556 keep the key of [our]_p4557 door always fastened to [my]_p4558 wrist at night, but [she]_p4559 gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window. Last night [I]_p4560 found [her]_p4564 leaning out when [I]_p4561 woke up, and when [I]_p4561 tried to wake [her]_p4565 [I]_p4562 could not [she]_p4566 was in a faint. When [I]_p4567 managed to restore [her]_p4568 [she]_p4569 was as weak as water, and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath.",2,,24,
stoker_dracula," When [I]_p4570 asked [her]_p4571 how [she]_p4573 came to be at the window [she]_p4574 shook [her]_p4572 head and turned away. [I]_p4575 trust [her]_p4576 feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. [I]_p4577 looked at [her]_p4578 throat just now as [she]_p4579 lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed. [They]_p4580 are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the edges of [them]_p4581 are faintly white. [They]_p4582 are like little white dots with red centres. Unless [they]_p4583 heal within a day or two, [I]_p4584 shall insist on the doctor seeing about them. Letter, [Samuel F]_n392. [Billington]_n393 & Son, Solicitors, [Whitby]_n,394 to Messrs.

All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and [she]_p4612 has just reminded me, as if [I]_p4613 needed any reminding, of that night, and that [it]_p4615 was here, on this very seat, [I]_p4614 found [her]_p4610 asleep. As [she]_p4616 told [me]_p4618 [she]_p4617 tapped playfully with the heel of [her]_p4620 boot on the stone slab and said:,   ""My poor little feet didn't make much noise then! [I]_p4621 daresay poor old Mr Swales would have told [me]_p4619 that [it]_p4623 was because [I]_p4622 didn't want to wake up Geordie. "" As [she]_p4624 was in such a communicative humour, [I]_p4626 asked [her]_p4627 if [she]_p4625 had dreamed at all that night. Before [she]_p4628 answered, that sweet, puckered look came into [her]_p4629 forehead, which [Arthur]_n,423 [I]_p4631 call [him]_p4633 [Arthur]_n424 from [her]_p4630 habit, says [he]_p4634 loves and, indeed, [I]_p4632 don't wonder that [he]_p4635 does. Then [she]_p4636 went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall [it]_p4637 to herself:,   ""I didn't quite dream but [it]_p4638 all seemed to be real. [I]_p4639 only wanted to be here in this spot, [I]_p4640 don't know why, for [I]_p4640 was afraid of something, [I]_p4641 don't know what. [I]_p4643 remember, though [I]_p4644 suppose [I]_p4644 was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as [I]_p4646 went by, and [I]_p4647 leaned over to look at it, and [I]_p4647 heard a lot of dogs howling, the whole town seemed as if [it]_p4650 must be full of dogs all howling at once, as [I]_p4648 went up the steps.",3,,44,
stoker_dracula," Then [I]_p4652 had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as [we]_p4655 saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around [me]_p4656 at once and then [I]_p4653 seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in [my]_p4658 ears, as [I]_p4653 have heard there is to drowning men and then everything seemed passing away from [me]_p4657 [my]_p4659 soul seemed to go out from [my]_p4659 body and float about the air. [I]_p4661 seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if [I]_p4662 were in an earthquake, and [I]_p4662 came back and found [you]_p4664 shaking [my]_p4665 body. [I]_p4666 saw [you]_p4668 do [it]_p4670 before [I]_p4667 felt you. ""  Then [she]_p4671 began to laugh. [It]_p4672 seemed a little uncanny to me, and [I]_p4673 listened to [her]_p4674 breathlessly. [I]_p4675 did not quite like it, and thought [it]_p4676 better not to keep [her]_p4678 mind on the subject, so [we]_p4680 drifted on to other subjects, and [Lucy]_n425 was like [her]_p4679 old self again. When [we]_p4681 got home the fresh breeze had braced [her]_p4682 up, and [her]_p4683 pale cheeks were really more rosy. [Her]_p4684 mother rejoiced when [she]_p4685 saw her, and [we]_p4686 all spent a very happy evening together. * * * * *  19 August. , Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy.",1,,33,

stoker_dracula," "" [Dr Seward]_n's448 [Diary]_n449. 19 August. , Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About eight o'clock [he]_p4776 began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting. The attendant was struck by [his]_p4777 manner, and knowing [my]_p4778 interest in him, encouraged [him]_p4779 to talk. [He]_p4781 is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile but [to-night]_n,450 the man tells me, [he]_p4782 was quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with [him]_p4783 at all. All [he]_p4784 would say was:, ""I don't want to talk to you: [you]_p4785 don't count now the [Master]_n451 is at hand. ""  The attendant thinks [it]_p4787 is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him. If so, [we]_p4788 must look out for squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous.",4,,11,
stoker_dracula," The combination is a dreadful one. At nine o'clock [I]_p4789 visited [him]_p4790 myself. [His]_p4791 attitude to [me]_p4792 was the same as that to the attendant in [his]_p4793 sublime self-feeling the difference between [myself]_p4794 and attendant seemed to [him]_p4795 as nothing. [It]_p4796 looks like religious mania, and [he]_p4797 will soon think that [he]_p4798 [himself]_p4799 is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an [Omnipotent]_n452 Being. How these madmen give [themselves]_p4800 away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall but the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh, if men only knew!  For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree. [I]_p4801 did not pretend to be watching him, but [I]_p4802 kept strict observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into [his]_p4803 eyes which [we]_p4804 always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with [it]_p4805 the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well. [He]_p4806 became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of [his]_p4807 bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes.",1,,19,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p4808 thought [I]_p4809 would find out if [his]_p4810 apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to lead [him]_p4813 to talk of [his]_p4811 pets, a theme which had never failed to excite [his]_p4811 attention. At first [he]_p4814 made no reply, but at length said testily:,   ""Bother [them]_p4815 all! [I]_p4817 don't care a pin about them. ""  ""What?"" [I]_p4818 said. ""You don't mean to tell [me]_p4819 [you]_p4820 don't care about spiders?"" (Spiders at present are [his]_p4821 hobby and the note-book is filling up with columns of small figures. ) To this [he]_p4822 answered enigmatically:,   ""The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride  but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled. ""  [He]_p4823 would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on [his]_p4824 bed all the time [I]_p4825 remained with him. [I]_p4826 am weary [to-night]_n453 and low in spirits. [I]_p4827 cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been. If [I]_p4828 don't sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus, C{2}HCl{3}O. H{2}O! [I]_p4829 must be careful not to let [it]_p4830 grow into a habit.",1,,22,

If need be, [to-night]_n456 shall be sleepless. * * * * *  Later. , Glad [I]_p4835 made the resolution gladder that [I]_p4836 kept to it. [I]_p4837 had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped. [I]_p4838 threw on [my]_p4839 clothes and ran down at once [my]_p4840 patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of [his]_p4841 might work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me. [He]_p4842 said [he]_p4843 had seen [him]_p4845 not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in [his]_p4846 bed, when [he]_p4844 had looked through the observation-trap in the door. [His]_p4847 attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out.",3,,17,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p4848 ran back and saw [his]_p4849 feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me. [He]_p4850 was only in [his]_p4851 night-gear, and cannot be far off. The attendant thought [it]_p4852 would be more useful to watch where [he]_p4853 should go than to follow him, as [he]_p4854 might lose sight of [him]_p4855 whilst getting out of the building by the door. [He]_p4857 is a bulky man, and couldn't get through the window. [I]_p4858 am thin, so, with [his]_p4860 aid, [I]_p4859 got out, but feet foremost, and, as [we]_p4861 were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The attendant told [me]_p4862 the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a straight line, so [I]_p4863 ran as quickly as [I]_p4864 could. As [I]_p4865 got through the belt of trees [I]_p4866 saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates [our]_p4867 grounds from those of the deserted house. [I]_p4868 ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow [me]_p4869 into the grounds of Carfax, in case [our]_p4870 friend might be dangerous. [I]_p4871 got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side. [I]_p4872 could see Renfield's figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so [I]_p4873 ran after him.",0,,25,
stoker_dracula," On the far side of the house [I]_p4874 found [him]_p4875 pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel. [He]_p4876 was talking, apparently to some one, but [I]_p4877 was afraid to go near enough to hear what [he]_p4879 was saying, lest [I]_p4878 might frighten him, and [he]_p4880 should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him! After a few minutes, however, [I]_p4885 could see that [he]_p4886 did not take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him, the more so as [my]_p4887 men had now crossed the wall and were closing [him]_p4881 in. [I]_p4888 heard [him]_p4890 say:, ""I am here to do [Your]_p4891 bidding, [Master]_n457. [I]_p4892 am [Your]_p4894 slave, and [You]_p4895 will reward me, for [I]_p4893 shall be faithful. [I]_p4896 have worshipped [You]_p4897 long and afar off. Now that [You]_p4898 are near, [I]_p4901 await [Your]_p4902 commands, and [You]_p4899 will not pass [me]_p4904 by, will You, [dear]_n458 Master, in [Your]_p4903 distribution of good things?"" [He]_p4905 is a selfish old beggar anyhow. [He]_p4906 thinks of the loaves and fishes even when [he]_p4907 believes [he]_p4908 is in a Real Presence. [His]_p4909 manias make a startling combination. When [we]_p4910 closed in on [him]_p4911 [he]_p4912 fought like a tiger.",2,,34,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p4913 is immensely strong, for [he]_p4914 was more like a wild beast than a man. [I]_p4915 never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before and [I]_p4916 hope [I]_p4916 shall not again. [It]_p4918 is a mercy that [we]_p4919 have found out [his]_p4920 strength and [his]_p4921 danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, [he]_p4922 might have done wild work before [he]_p4923 was caged. [He]_p4924 is safe now at any rate. [Jack]_n459 [Sheppard]_n460 [himself]_p4925 couldn't get free from the strait-waistcoat that keeps [him]_p4926 restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded room. [His]_p4927 cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more deadly still, for [he]_p4928 means murder in every turn and movement. Just now [he]_p4929 spoke coherent words for the first time:,   ""I shall be patient, Master. [It]_p4930 is coming, coming, coming!""  So [I]_p4931 took the hint, and came too. [I]_p4932 was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and [I]_p4933 feel [I]_p4933 shall get some sleep [to-night]_n461.",3,,22,

When the chaplain and the sisters had left [me]_p5090 alone with [my]_p5092 husband, oh, Lucy, [it]_p5098 is the first time [I]_p5102 have written the words 'my husband', left [me]_p5091 alone with [my]_p5093 husband, [I]_p5103 took the book from under [his]_p5105 pillow, and wrapped [it]_p5099 up in white paper, and tied [it]_p5099 with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round [my]_p5093 neck, and sealed [it]_p5100 over the knot with sealing-wax, and for [my]_p5094 seal [I]_p5103 used [my]_p5094 wedding ring. Then [I]_p5106 kissed [it]_p5109 and showed [it]_p5110 to [my]_p5115 husband, and told [him]_p5116 that [I]_p5107 would keep [it]_p5110 so, and then [it]_p5111 would be an outward and visible sign for [us]_p5117 all [our]_p5118 lives that [we]_p5119 trusted each other that [I]_p5107 would never open [it]_p5111 unless [it]_p5111 were for [his]_p5120 own [dear]_n483 sake or for the sake of some stern duty. Then [he]_p5121 took [my]_p5124 hand in his, and oh, Lucy, [it]_p5127 was the first time [he]_p5122 took [his]_p5125 wife's hand, and said that [it]_p5128 was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that [he]_p5122 would go through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor [dear]_n484 meant to have said a part of the past, but [he]_p5130 cannot think of time yet, and [I]_p5132 shall not wonder if at first [he]_p5131 mixes up not only the month, but the year. ""Well, [my]_p5133 [dear]_n,485 what could [I]_p5138 say? [I]_p5139 could only tell [him]_p5142 that [I]_p5139 was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that [I]_p5140 had nothing to give [him]_p5143 except myself, [my]_p5134 life, and [my]_p5134 trust, and that with these went [my]_p5135 love and duty for all the days of [my]_p5135 life. And, [my]_p5144 [dear]_n,486 when [he]_p5145 kissed me, and drew [me]_p5146 to [him]_p5148 with [his]_p5149 poor weak hands, [it]_p5150 was like a very solemn pledge between us. ""Lucy [dear]_n,487 do [you]_p5151 know why [I]_p5154 tell [you]_p5152 all this?

stoker_dracula," , The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. [He]_p5218 has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from [his]_p5219 passion. For the first week after [his]_p5220 attack [he]_p5221 was perpetually violent. Then one night, just as the moon rose, [he]_p5222 grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself: ""Now [I]_p5223 can wait now [I]_p5224 can wait. "" The attendant came to tell me, so [I]_p5225 ran down at once to have a look at him. [He]_p5226 was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from [his]_p5227 face, and [his]_p5228 eyes had something of [their]_p5229 old pleading, [I]_p5230 might almost say, ""cringing"", softness. [I]_p5231 was satisfied with [his]_p5232 present condition, and directed [him]_p5233 to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out [my]_p5234 wishes without protest. [It]_p5235 was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see [their]_p5237 distrust, for, coming close to me, [he]_p5240 said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them:,   ""They think [I]_p5241 could hurt you! Fancy [me]_p5238 hurting you! The fools!""  [It]_p5236 was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find [myself]_p5243 dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others but all the same [I]_p5242 do not follow [his]_p5244 thought. Am [I]_p5245 to take [it]_p5248 that [I]_p5246 have anything in common with him, so that [we]_p5250 are, as [it]_p5249 were, to stand together or has [he]_p5251 to gain from [me]_p5252 some good so stupendous that [my]_p5253 well-being is needful to him?

[I]_p5256 have more to think of now, and [I]_p5257 can wait [I]_p5257 can wait. ""  After a while [I]_p5259 left him. The attendant tells [me]_p5260 that [he]_p5261 was quiet until just before dawn, and that then [he]_p5262 began to get uneasy, and at length violent, until at last [he]_p5262 fell into a paroxysm which exhausted [him]_p5265 so that [he]_p5263 swooned into a sort of coma. * * * * *. Three nights has the same thing happened, violent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise. [I]_p5266 wish [I]_p5267 could get some clue to the cause.

Then [he]_p5287 dashed out past [him]_p5288 and flew down the passage. [I]_p5289 sent word for the attendants to follow. Again [he]_p5290 went into the grounds of the deserted house, and [we]_p5291 found [him]_p5292 in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When [he]_p5293 saw [me]_p5296 [he]_p5294 became furious, and had not the attendants seized [him]_p5298 in time, [he]_p5294 would have tried to kill me. As [we]_p5299 were holding [him]_p5300 a strange thing happened.",0,,15,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p5301 suddenly redoubled [his]_p5302 efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm. [I]_p5303 looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then [I]_p5304 caught the patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as [it]_p5305 looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping [its]_p5307 silent and ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if [it]_p5308 knew where [it]_p5309 was bound for or had some intention of [its]_p5310 own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said:,   ""You needn't tie [me]_p5311 [I]_p5312 shall go quietly!"" Without trouble [we]_p5313 came back to the house. [I]_p5314 feel there is something ominous in [his]_p5315 calm, and shall not forget this night.

Perhaps [it]_p5327 is the change of air, or getting home again. [It]_p5328 is all dark and horrid to me, for [I]_p5329 can remember nothing but [I]_p5330 am full of vague fear, and [I]_p5330 feel so weak and worn out. When [Arthur]_n505 came to lunch [he]_p5332 looked quite grieved when [he]_p5333 saw me, and [I]_p5334 hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful.

stoker_dracula," [She]_p5339 seems not too well herself, and doubtless [she]_p5340 fears to worry me. [I]_p5341 tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while but when the clock struck twelve [it]_p5343 waked [me]_p5344 from a doze, so [I]_p5342 must have been falling asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but [I]_p5345 did not mind it, and as [I]_p5346 remember no more, [I]_p5346 suppose [I]_p5347 must then have fallen asleep. More bad dreams. [I]_p5349 wish [I]_p5350 could remember them. This morning [I]_p5351 am horribly weak. [My]_p5352 face is ghastly pale, and [my]_p5353 throat pains me.

[I]_p5424 shall then say what [I]_p5425 have done and propose doing. ""I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. [Her]_p5426 mother was present, and in a few seconds [I]_p5427 made up [my]_p5428 mind that [she]_p5429 was trying all [she]_p5430 knew to mislead [her]_p5431 mother and prevent [her]_p5432 from being anxious. [I]_p5433 have no doubt [she]_p5434 guesses, if [she]_p5435 does not know, what need of caution there is. [We]_p5436 lunched alone, and as [we]_p5437 all exerted [ourselves]_p5439 to be cheerful, [we]_p5438 got, as some kind of reward for [our]_p5440 labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me.",1,,35,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p5441 went into [her]_p5442 boudoir, and till [we]_p5444 got there [her]_p5443 gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from [her]_p5445 face, and [she]_p5448 sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid [her]_p5446 eyes with [her]_p5446 hand. When [I]_p5449 saw that [her]_p5451 high spirits had failed, [I]_p5450 at once took advantage of [her]_p5452 reaction to make a diagnosis. [She]_p5453 said to [me]_p5454 very sweetly:,   ""'I cannot tell [you]_p5455 how [I]_p5456 loathe talking about myself. ' [I]_p5458 reminded [her]_p5459 that a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that [you]_p5461 were grievously anxious about her. [She]_p5462 caught on to [my]_p5463 meaning at once, and settled that matter in a word. 'Tell [Arthur]_n528 everything [you]_p5464 choose. [I]_p5465 do not care for myself, but all for him!' So [I]_p5466 am quite free. ""I could easily see that [she]_p5470 is somewhat bloodless, but [I]_p5467 could not see the usual an mic signs, and by a chance [I]_p5468 was actually able to test the quality of [her]_p5472 blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and [she]_p5471 cut [her]_p5473 hand slightly with broken glass. [It]_p5474 was a slight matter in itself, but [it]_p5475 gave [me]_p5476 an evident chance, and [I]_p5477 secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them.",1,,34,
stoker_dracula," The qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, [I]_p5478 should infer, in [itself]_p5479 a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters [I]_p5480 was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety but as there must be a cause somewhere, [I]_p5481 have come to the conclusion that [it]_p5482 must be something mental. [She]_p5483 complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but regarding which [she]_p5484 can remember nothing. [She]_p5485 says that as a child [she]_p5486 used to walk in [her]_p5489 sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once [she]_p5487 walked out in the night and went to [East Cliff]_n,529 where Miss Murray found [her]_p5490 but [she]_p5487 assures [me]_p5491 that of late the habit has not returned. [I]_p5492 am in doubt, and so have done the best thing [I]_p5493 know of [I]_p5493 have written to [my]_p5495 old friend and master, [Professor]_n530 [Van Helsing]_n,531 of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world. [I]_p5496 have asked [him]_p5498 to come over, and as [you]_p5500 told [me]_p5502 that all things were to be at [your]_p5503 charge, [I]_p5497 have mentioned to [him]_p5499 who [you]_p5501 are and [your]_p5504 relations to Miss Westenra. This, [my]_p5505 [dear]_n532 fellow, is in obedience to [your]_p5506 wishes, for [I]_p5507 am only too proud and happy to do anything [I]_p5508 can for her. [Van Helsing]_n533 would, [I]_p5509 know, do anything for [me]_p5510 for a personal reason, so, no matter on what ground [he]_p5511 comes, [we]_p5512 must accept [his]_p5513 wishes. [He]_p5514 is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because [he]_p5515 knows what [he]_p5516 is talking about better than any one else. [He]_p5517 is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of [his]_p5518 day  and [he]_p5519 has, [I]_p5520 believe, an absolutely open mind.",5,,43,

[I]_p5525 tell [you]_p5527 these facts that [you]_p5528 may know why [I]_p5526 have such confidence in him. [I]_p5529 have asked [him]_p5530 to come at once.

[He]_p5577 is to report to me, and [I]_p5578 shall advise you, for of course [I]_p5579 was not present all the time. [He]_p5580 is, [I]_p5581 fear, much concerned, but says [he]_p5582 must think. When [I]_p5583 told [him]_p5584 of [our]_p5586 friendship and how [you]_p5587 trust to [me]_p5589 in the matter, [he]_p5590 said: 'You must tell [him]_p5585 all [you]_p5588 think. Tell [him]_p5591 what [I]_p5592 think, if [you]_p5593 can guess it, if [you]_p5594 will. [Nay]_n,550 [I]_p5595 am not jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more. ' [I]_p5596 asked what [he]_p5597 meant by that, for [he]_p5598 was very serious. This was when [we]_p5599 had come back to town, and [he]_p5600 was having a cup of tea before starting on [his]_p5601 return to Amsterdam. [He]_p5602 would not give [me]_p5603 any further clue.",2,,27,
stoker_dracula," [You]_p5604 must not be angry with me, Art, because [his]_p5605 very reticence means that all [his]_p5606 brains are working for [her]_p5607 good. [He]_p5608 will speak plainly enough when the time comes, be sure. So [I]_p5609 told [him]_p5612 [I]_p5610 would simply write an account of [our]_p5613 visit, just as if [I]_p5610 were doing a descriptive special article for The Daily Telegraph. [He]_p5614 seemed not to notice, but remarked that the smuts in London were not quite so bad as [they]_p5615 used to be when [he]_p5616 was a student here. [I]_p5617 am to get [his]_p5618 report [to-morrow]_n551 if [he]_p5619 can possibly make it. In any case [I]_p5620 am to have a letter. ""Well, as to the visit. [Lucy]_n552 was more cheerful than on the day [I]_p5621 first saw her, and certainly looked better. [She]_p5622 had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and [her]_p5623 breathing was normal. [She]_p5624 was very sweet to the professor (as [she]_p5625 always is), and tried to make [him]_p5626 feel at ease though [I]_p5627 could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it.",2,,24,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p5628 believe [Van Helsing]_n553 saw it, too, for [I]_p5629 saw the quick look under [his]_p5631 bushy brows that [I]_p5629 knew of old. Then [he]_p5632 began to chat of all things except [ourselves]_p5633 and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that [I]_p5634 could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into reality. Then, without any seeming change, [he]_p5635 brought the conversation gently round to [his]_p5636 visit, and suavely said:, ""'My [dear]_n554 [young]_n555 miss, [I]_p5637 have the so great pleasure because [you]_p5638 are so much beloved. That is much, [my]_p5639 [dear]_n,556 ever were there that which [I]_p5640 do not see. [They]_p5641 told [me]_p5642 [you]_p5643 were down in the spirit, and that [you]_p5644 were of a ghastly pale. To [them]_p5645 [I]_p5647 say: ""Pouf!""' And [he]_p5649 snapped [his]_p5650 fingers at [me]_p5651 and went on: 'But [you]_p5652 and [I]_p5648 shall show [them]_p5646 how wrong [they]_p5653 are. How can he', and [he]_p5654 pointed at [me]_p5658 with the same look and gesture as that with which once [he]_p5655 pointed [me]_p5659 out to [his]_p5661 class, on, or rather after, a particular occasion which [he]_p5655 never fails to remind [me]_p5659 of, 'know anything of a [young]_n557 ladies? [He]_p5663 has [his]_p5662 madams to play with, and to bring [them]_p5664 back to happiness, and to those that love them. [It]_p5666 is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards, in that [we]_p5667 can bestow such happiness. But the [young]_n558 ladies! [He]_p5668 has no wife nor daughter, and the [young]_n559 do not tell [themselves]_p5669 to [the y]_noung,560 but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them. So, [my]_p5670 [dear]_n,561 [we]_p5671 will send [him]_p5672 away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles [you]_p5673 and [I]_p5674 have little talk all to ourselves.",9,,45,
stoker_dracula," ' [I]_p5675 took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor came to the window and called [me]_p5676 in. [He]_p5677 looked grave, but said: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause. With [you]_p5678 [I]_p5679 agree that there has been much blood lost [it]_p5680 has been, but is not. But the conditions of [her]_p5681 are in no way an mic. [I]_p5682 have asked [her]_p5685 to send [me]_p5687 [her]_p5686 maid, that [I]_p5683 may ask just one or two question, that so [I]_p5683 may not chance to miss nothing. [I]_p5688 know well what [she]_p5689 will say. And yet there is cause there is always cause for everything. [I]_p5690 must go back home and think. [You]_p5691 must send to [me]_p5692 the telegram every day and if there be cause [I]_p5693 shall come again.

[I]_p5706 trust [your]_p5707 poor father is rallying. [It]_p5708 must be a terrible thing to you, [my]_p5709 [dear]_n565 old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so [dear]_n566 to you. [I]_p5710 know [your]_p5712 idea of duty to [your]_p5713 father, and [you]_p5714 are right to stick to [it]_p5717 but, if need be, [I]_p5711 shall send [you]_p5715 word to come at once to Lucy so do not be over-anxious unless [you]_p5715 hear from me.

stoker_dracula," [He]_p5719 had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the stroke of noon [he]_p5720 began to grow restless. The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon [he]_p5721 became so violent that [it]_p5722 took all [their]_p5723 strength to hold him. In about five minutes, however, [he]_p5724 began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state [he]_p5725 has remained up to now. The attendant tells [me]_p5726 that [his]_p5727 screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling [I]_p5728 found [my]_p5730 hands full when [I]_p5729 got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, [I]_p5731 can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though [I]_p5732 was some distance away. [It]_p5733 is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and as yet [my]_p5734 patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in [his]_p5735 face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly. [I]_p5736 cannot quite understand it. * * * * *  Later.",0,,18,
stoker_dracula," , Another change in [my]_p5737 patient. At five o'clock [I]_p5738 looked in on him, and found [him]_p5739 seemingly as happy and contented as [he]_p5741 used to be. [He]_p5742 was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of [his]_p5743 capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When [he]_p5744 saw me, [he]_p5745 came over and apologised for [his]_p5748 bad conduct, and asked [me]_p5746 in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to [his]_p5749 own room and to have [his]_p5749 note-book again. [I]_p5751 thought [it]_p5752 well to humour him: so [he]_p5753 is back in [his]_p5754 room with the window open. [He]_p5755 has the sugar of [his]_p5756 tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. [He]_p5757 is not now eating them, but putting [them]_p5758 into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of [his]_p5760 room to find a spider. [I]_p5761 tried to get [him]_p5762 to talk about the past few days, for any clue to [his]_p5763 thoughts would be of immense help to [me]_p5764 but [he]_p5765 would not rise. For a moment or two [he]_p5766 looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away voice, as though saying [it]_p5767 rather to [himself]_p5768 than to me:,   ""All over! all over! [He]_p5769 has deserted me. No hope for [me]_p5770 now unless [I]_p5775 do [it]_p5777 for myself!"" Then suddenly turning to [me]_p5771 in a resolute way, [he]_p5779 said: ""Doctor, won't [you]_p5780 be very good to [me]_p5771 and let [me]_p5772 have a little more sugar? [I]_p5776 think [it]_p5778 would be good for me.",0,,40,
stoker_dracula," ""  ""And the flies?"" [I]_p5781 said. ""Yes! The flies like it, too, and [I]_p5782 like the flies therefore [I]_p5783 like it. "" And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue. [I]_p5784 procured [him]_p5786 a double supply, and left [him]_p5787 as happy a man as, [I]_p5785 suppose, any in the world. [I]_p5788 wish [I]_p5789 could fathom [his]_p5790 mind. * * * * *  Midnight. , Another change in him. [I]_p5791 had been to see Miss Westenra, whom [I]_p5792 found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at [our]_p5794 own gate looking at the sunset, when once more [I]_p5792 heard [him]_p5795 yelling. As [his]_p5796 room is on this side of the house, [I]_p5797 could hear [it]_p5798 better than in the morning. [It]_p5799 was a shock to [me]_p5800 to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with [its]_p5801 lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realise all the grim sternness of [my]_p5803 own cold stone building, with [its]_p5802 wealth of breathing misery, and [my]_p5804 own desolate heart to endure [it]_p5805 all.",0,,25,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p5806 reached [him]_p5807 just as the sun was going down, and from [his]_p5808 window saw the red disc sink. As [it]_p5809 sank [he]_p5811 became less and less frenzied and just as [it]_p5810 dipped [he]_p5812 slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor. [It]_p5813 is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes [he]_p5814 stood up quite calmly and looked around him. [I]_p5815 signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for [I]_p5816 was anxious to see what [he]_p5817 would do. [He]_p5818 went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar then [he]_p5819 took [his]_p5821 fly-box, and emptied [it]_p5823 outside, and threw away the box then [he]_p5820 shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on [his]_p5822 bed. All this surprised me, so [I]_p5824 asked him: ""Are [you]_p5826 not going to keep flies any more?""  ""No,"" said [he]_p5827 ""I am sick of all that rubbish!"" [He]_p5828 certainly is a wonderfully interesting study. [I]_p5829 wish [I]_p5830 could get some glimpse of [his]_p5831 mind or of the cause of [his]_p5832 sudden passion. Stop there may be a clue after all, if [we]_p5833 can find why to-day [his]_p5834 paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset. Can [it]_p5835 be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures, as at times the moon does others? [We]_p5836 shall see.

[I]_p5840 took advantage of the opportunity, and told [her]_p5842 that [my]_p5847 old master, [Van Helsing]_n,591 the great specialist, was coming to stay with me, and that [I]_p5841 would put [her]_p5843 in [his]_p5848 charge conjointly with [myself]_p5849 so now [we]_p5850 can come and go without alarming [her]_p5843 unduly, for a shock to [her]_p5844 would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weak condition, might be disastrous to her.

""I have for [myself]_p5906 thoughts at the present. Later [I]_p5907 shall unfold to you. ""  ""Why not now?"" [I]_p5908 asked. ""It may do some good [we]_p5909 may arrive at some decision. "" [He]_p5910 stopped and looked at me, and said:,   ""My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before [it]_p5911 has ripened, while the milk of [its]_p5912 mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint [him]_p5913 with [his]_p5916 gold, the husbandman [he]_p5918 pull the ear and rub [him]_p5914 between [his]_p5917 rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you: 'Look! he's good corn [he]_p5919 will make good crop when the time comes.",1,,35,
stoker_dracula," '"" [I]_p5921 did not see the application, and told [him]_p5922 so. For reply [he]_p5923 reached over and took [my]_p5926 ear in [his]_p5927 hand and pulled [it]_p5928 playfully, as [he]_p5924 used long ago to do at lectures, and said: ""The good husbandman tell [you]_p5929 so then because [he]_p5924 knows, but not till then.

When [I]_p5966 described Lucy's symptoms, the same as before, but infinitely more marked, [he]_p5967 looked very grave, but said nothing. [He]_p5968 took with [him]_p5969 a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, ""the ghastly paraphernalia of [our]_p5970 beneficial trade,"" as [he]_p5971 once called, in one of [his]_p5972 lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When [we]_p5973 were shown in, Mrs Westenra met us. [She]_p5974 was alarmed, but not nearly so much as [I]_p5975 expected to find her. Nature in one of [her]_p5976 beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to [its]_p5977 own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal, even the terrible change in [her]_p5978 daughter to whom [she]_p5980 is so attached, do not seem to reach her. [It]_p5981 is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which [it]_p5982 would otherwise harm by contact.",0,,22,
stoker_dracula," If this be an ordered selfishness, then [we]_p5983 should pause before [we]_p5984 condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for [its]_p5986 causes than [we]_p5984 have knowledge of. [I]_p5987 used [my]_p5988 knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that [she]_p5989 should not be present with Lucy or think of [her]_p5990 illness more than was absolutely required. [She]_p5991 assented readily, so readily that [I]_p5992 saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. [Van Helsing]_n599 and [I]_p5993 were shown up to [Lucy]_n's600 room. If [I]_p5994 was shocked when [I]_p5995 saw [her]_p5998 yesterday, [I]_p5995 was horrified when [I]_p5996 saw [her]_p5999 to-day. [She]_p6000 was ghastly, chalkily pale the red seemed to have gone even from [her]_p6001 lips and gums, and the bones of [her]_p6002 face stood out prominently [her]_p6002 breathing was painful to see or hear. [Van Helsing]_n's601 face grew set as marble, and [his]_p6004 eyebrows converged till [they]_p6006 almost touched over [his]_p6005 nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while [we]_p6007 were all silent. Then [Van Helsing]_n602 beckoned to me, and [we]_p6008 went gently out of the room. The instant [we]_p6009 had closed the door [he]_p6010 stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open.",4,,28,
stoker_dracula," Then [he]_p6011 pulled [me]_p6012 quickly in with [him]_p6013 and closed the door. ""My God!"" [he]_p6014 said ""this is dreadful. There is no time to be lost.

When [we]_p6025 reached the hall the maid had just opened the door, and [Arthur]_n603 was stepping quickly in. [He]_p6026 rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper:, ""[Jack]_n,604 [I]_p6027 was so anxious. [I]_p6028 read between the lines of [your]_p6029 letter, and have been in an agony.

[You]_p6049 can do more than any that live, and [your]_p6050 courage is [your]_p6051 best help. "" ""What can [I]_p6052 do?"" asked [Arthur]_n610 hoarsely. ""Tell me, and [I]_p6053 shall do it. [My]_p6054 life is hers, and [I]_p6055 would give the last drop of blood in [my]_p6056 body for her. "" The [Professor]_n611 has a strongly humorous side, and [I]_p6057 could from old knowledge detect a trace of [its]_p6060 origin in [his]_p6061 answer:, ""My [young]_n612 sir, [I]_p6058 do not ask so much as that, not the last!"" ""What shall [I]_p6058 do?"" There was fire in [his]_p6062 eyes, and [his]_p6062 open nostril quivered with intent. [Van Helsing]_n613 slapped [him]_p6064 on the shoulder. ""Come!"" [he]_p6065 said.",5,,19,
stoker_dracula," ""You are a man, and [it]_p6066 is a man [we]_p6067 want. [You]_p6068 are better than me, better than [my]_p6069 friend John. "" [Arthur]_n614 looked bewildered, and the [Professor]_n615 went on by explaining in a kindly way:, ""Young miss is bad, very bad. [She]_p6070 wants blood, and blood [she]_p6071 must have or die. [My]_p6072 friend John and [I]_p6073 have consulted and [we]_p6074 are about to perform what [we]_p6075 call transfusion of blood, to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give [his]_p6076 blood, as [he]_p6077 is the more [young]_n616 and strong than me"", here [Arthur]_n617 took [my]_p6078 hand and wrung [it]_p6079 hard in silence, ""but, now [you]_p6080 are here, [you]_p6081 are more good than us, old or [young]_n,618 who toil much in the world of thought. [Our]_p6082 nerves are not so calm and [our]_p6083 blood not so bright than yours!"" [Arthur]_n619 turned to [him]_p6084 and said:, ""If [you]_p6085 only knew how gladly [I]_p6087 would die for [her]_p6088 [you]_p6086 would understand, , "" [He]_p6089 stopped, with a sort of choke in [his]_p6090 voice. ""[Good]_n620 boy!"" said [Van Helsing]_n621. ""In the not-so-far-off [you]_p6091 will be happy that [you]_p6092 have done all for [her]_p6094 [you]_p6092 love. Come now and be silent.",8,,29,

Say no word to Madame [you]_p6101 know how [it]_p6102 is with her! There must be no shock any knowledge of this would be one. Come!""  [We]_p6103 all went up to Lucy's room. [Arthur]_n622 by direction remained outside. [Lucy]_n623 turned [her]_p6104 head and looked at us, but said nothing. [She]_p6105 was not asleep, but [she]_p6106 was simply too weak to make the effort. [Her]_p6107 eyes spoke to [us]_p6108 that was all. [Van Helsing]_n624 took some things from [his]_p6109 bag and laid [them]_p6110 on a little table out of sight. Then [he]_p6111 mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily:,   ""Now, little miss, here is [your]_p6112 medicine. Drink [it]_p6113 off, like a good child.",3,,19,
stoker_dracula," See, [I]_p6114 lift [you]_p6115 so that to swallow is easy. Yes. "" [She]_p6116 had made the effort with success. [It]_p6117 astonished [me]_p6118 how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked the extent of [her]_p6119 weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in [her]_p6120 eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest [its]_p6121 potency and [she]_p6122 fell into a deep sleep. When the [Professor]_n625 was satisfied [he]_p6123 called [Arthur]_n626 into the room, and bade [him]_p6124 strip off [his]_p6125 coat. Then [he]_p6126 added: ""You may take that one little kiss whiles [I]_p6127 bring over the table. [Friend John]_n,627 help to me!"" So neither of [us]_p6128 looked whilst [he]_p6129 bent over her.",3,,16,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n628 turning to me, said: ""He is so [young]_n629 and strong and of blood so pure that [we]_p6130 need not defibrinate it. "" Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, [Van Helsing]_n630 performed the operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through [Arthur]_n's631 growing pallor the joy of [his]_p6131 face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit [I]_p6132 began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on [Arthur]_n,632 strong man as [he]_p6133 was. [It]_p6134 gave [me]_p6135 an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must have undergone that what weakened [Arthur]_n633 only partially restored her. But the [Professor]_n's634 face was set, and [he]_p6136 stood watch in hand and with [his]_p6137 eyes fixed now on the patient and now on [Arthur]_n635. [I]_p6138 could hear [my]_p6139 own heart beat. Presently [he]_p6140 said in a soft voice: ""Do not stir an instant. [It]_p6141 is enough. [You]_p6142 attend [him]_p6143 [I]_p6144 will look to her.",8,,15,
stoker_dracula," "" When all was over [I]_p6145 could see how much [Arthur]_n636 was weakened. [I]_p6146 dressed the wound and took [his]_p6148 arm to bring [him]_p6150 away, when [Van Helsing]_n637 spoke without turning round, the man seems to have eyes in the back of [his]_p6149 head:, ""The brave lover, [I]_p6147 think, deserve another kiss, which [he]_p6151 shall have presently. "" And as [he]_p6152 had now finished [his]_p6154 operation, [he]_p6153 adjusted the pillow to the patient's head. As [he]_p6155 did so the narrow black velvet band which [she]_p6156 seems always to wear round [her]_p6157 throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which [her]_p6158 lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on [her]_p6158 throat. [Arthur]_n638 did not notice it, but [I]_p6161 could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of [Van Helsing]_n's639 ways of betraying emotion. [He]_p6162 said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying: ""Now take down [our]_p6163 brave [young]_n640 lover, give [him]_p6164 of the port wine, and let [him]_p6165 lie down a while. [He]_p6166 must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that [he]_p6167 may be recruited of what [he]_p6168 has so given to [his]_p6169 love. [He]_p6170 must not stay here. Hold! a moment. [I]_p6171 may take it, sir, that [you]_p6172 are anxious of result.",5,,27,
stoker_dracula," Then bring [it]_p6173 with [you]_p6174 that in all ways the operation is successful. [You]_p6175 have saved [her]_p6176 life this time, and [you]_p6177 can go home and [rest]_n641 easy in mind that all that can be is. [I]_p6178 shall tell [her]_p6179 all when [she]_p6180 is well [she]_p6181 shall love [you]_p6182 none the less for what [you]_p6183 have done. [Good-bye]_n642. "" When [Arthur]_n643 had gone [I]_p6184 went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently, but [her]_p6185 breathing was stronger [I]_p6187 could see the counterpane move as [her]_p6186 breast heaved. By the bedside sat [Van Helsing]_n,644 looking at [her]_p6188 intently. The velvet band again covered the red mark. [I]_p6189 asked the [Professor]_n645 in a whisper:, ""What do [you]_p6192 make of that mark on [her]_p6194 throat?"" ""What do [you]_p6193 make of it?"" ""I have not examined [it]_p6195 yet,"" [I]_p6190 answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking.",5,,22,
stoker_dracula," There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration. [It]_p6197 at once occurred to [me]_p6198 that this wound, or whatever [it]_p6199 was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood but [I]_p6200 abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as [she]_p6201 had before the transfusion. ""Well?"" said [Van Helsing]_n646. ""Well,"" said I, ""I can make nothing of it. "" The [Professor]_n647 stood up. ""I must go back to [Amsterdam to-night]_n,""648 [he]_p6202 said. ""There are books and things there which [I]_p6203 want. [You]_p6204 must remain here all the night, and [you]_p6205 must not let [your]_p6206 sight pass from her. ""  ""Shall [I]_p6207 have a nurse?"" [I]_p6208 asked.",3,,12,
stoker_dracula," ""We are the best nurses, [you]_p6209 and I. [You]_p6210 keep watch all night see that [she]_p6211 is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her.

[I]_p6217 said. ""What on earth do [you]_p6218 mean?""  ""We shall see!"" [he]_p6219 answered, as [he]_p6220 hurried out. [He]_p6221 came back a moment later and put [his]_p6222 head inside the door and said with warning finger held up:,   ""Remember, [she]_p6223 is [your]_p6224 charge. If [you]_p6225 leave her, and harm befall, [you]_p6226 shall not sleep easy hereafter!"" [Dr Seward]_n's650 [Diary]_n,651 continued.",3,,18,

The opiate worked [itself]_p6228 off towards dusk, and [she]_p6229 waked naturally [she]_p6230 looked a different being from what [she]_p6230 had been before the operation. [Her]_p6232 spirits even were good, and [she]_p6233 was full of a happy vivacity, but [I]_p6235 could see evidences of the absolute prostration which [she]_p6234 had undergone. When [I]_p6236 told Mrs Westenra that Dr [Van Helsing]_n653 had directed that [I]_p6237 should sit up with [her]_p6238 [she]_p6240 almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out [her]_p6239 daughter's renewed strength and excellent spirits. [I]_p6241 was firm, however, and made preparations for [my]_p6242 long vigil. When [her]_p6243 maid had prepared [her]_p6244 for the night [I]_p6245 came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside. [She]_p6246 did not in any way make objection, but looked at [me]_p6247 gratefully whenever [I]_p6248 caught [her]_p6249 eye. After a long spell [she]_p6250 seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull [herself]_p6251 together and shook [it]_p6252 off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on.",2,,26,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p6253 was apparent that [she]_p6254 did not want to sleep, so [I]_p6255 tackled the subject at once:,   ""You do not want to go to sleep?""  ""No [I]_p6256 am afraid. ""  ""Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? [It]_p6257 is the boon [we]_p6258 all crave for. ""  ""Ah, not if [you]_p6259 were like me, if sleep was to [you]_p6260 a presage of horror!""  ""A presage of horror! What on earth do [you]_p6260 mean?""  ""I don't know oh, [I]_p6262 don't know. And that is what is so terrible. All this weakness comes to [me]_p6264 in sleep until [I]_p6265 dread the very thought. "" ""But, [my]_p6266 [dear]_n654 girl, [you]_p6267 may sleep [to-night]_n655. [I]_p6268 am here watching you, and [I]_p6269 can promise that nothing will happen. ""  ""Ah, [I]_p6270 can trust you!"" [I]_p6271 seized the opportunity, and said: ""I promise [you]_p6275 that if [I]_p6271 see any evidence of bad dreams [I]_p6272 will wake [you]_p6276 at once. ""  ""You will? Oh, will [you]_p6278 really? How good [you]_p6279 are to me. Then [I]_p6280 will sleep!"" And almost at the word [she]_p6281 gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.",2,,26,
stoker_dracula," All night long [I]_p6282 watched by her. [She]_p6283 never stirred, but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. [Her]_p6284 lips were slightly parted, and [her]_p6285 breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum. There was a smile on [her]_p6286 face, and [it]_p6288 was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb [her]_p6287 peace of mind. In the early morning [her]_p6289 maid came, and [I]_p6292 left [her]_p6290 in [her]_p6290 care and took [myself]_p6294 back home, for [I]_p6293 was anxious about many things. [I]_p6295 sent a short wire to [Van Helsing]_n656 and to [Arthur]_n,657 telling [them]_p6296 of the excellent result of the operation.

For two nights [I]_p6311 had hardly had a wink of sleep, and [my]_p6312 brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. [Lucy]_n662 was up and in cheerful spirits. When [she]_p6313 shook hands with [me]_p6315 [she]_p6314 looked sharply in [my]_p6316 face and said:, ""No sitting up [to-night]_n663 for you. [You]_p6317 are worn out. [I]_p6318 am quite well again indeed, [I]_p6319 am and if there is to be any sitting up, [it]_p6321 is [I]_p6319 who will sit up with you. "" [I]_p6322 would not argue the point, but went and had [my]_p6323 supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by [her]_p6324 charming presence, [I]_p6325 made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port. Then Lucy took [me]_p6326 upstairs, and showed [me]_p6327 a room next [her]_p6328 own, where a cozy fire was burning. ""Now,"" [she]_p6329 said, ""you must stay here.",3,,21,

"" [I]_p6339 could not but acquiesce, for [I]_p6340 was ""dog-tired,"" and could not have sat up had [I]_p6340 tried. So, on [her]_p6342 renewing [her]_p6343 promise to call [me]_p6344 if [she]_p6345 should want anything, [I]_p6346 lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything. Lucy Westenra's Diary. 9 September. , [I]_p6347 feel so happy [to-night]_n664. [I]_p6348 have been so miserably weak, that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow [Arthur]_n665 feels very, very close to me.",2,,19,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p6349 seem to feel [his]_p6350 presence warm about me. [I]_p6351 suppose [it]_p6352 is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn [our]_p6353 inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling [he]_p6354 can wander where [he]_p6355 wills. [I]_p6356 know where [my]_p6357 thoughts are. If [Arthur]_n666 only knew! [My]_p6358 [dear]_n,667 [my]_p6359 [dear]_n,668 [your]_p6360 ears must tingle as [you]_p6361 sleep, as [mine]_p6362 do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of last night! How [I]_p6363 slept, with that [dear]_n,669 good Dr [Seward]_n670 watching me. And [to-night]_n671 [I]_p6364 shall not fear to sleep, since [he]_p6365 is close at hand and within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God! Good-night, [Arthur]_n672. [Dr Seward]_n's673 [Diary]_n674. 10 September. , [I]_p6366 was conscious of the [Professor]_n's675 hand on [my]_p6367 head, and started awake all in a second.",10,,19,
stoker_dracula," That is one of the things that [we]_p6368 learn in an asylum, at any rate. ""And how is [our]_p6369 patient?""  ""Well, when [I]_p6370 left her, or rather when [she]_p6372 left me,"" [I]_p6371 answered. ""Come, let [us]_p6373 see,"" [he]_p6374 said. And together [we]_p6375 went into the room. The blind was down, and [I]_p6376 went over to raise [it]_p6377 gently, whilst [Van Helsing]_n676 stepped, with [his]_p6378 soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed. As [I]_p6379 raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, [I]_p6380 heard the [Professor]_n's677 low hiss of inspiration, and knowing [its]_p6381 rarity, a deadly fear shot through [my]_p6382 heart. As [I]_p6383 passed over [he]_p6384 moved back, and [his]_p6385 exclamation of horror, ""Gott in Himmel!"" needed no enforcement from [his]_p6386 agonised face. [He]_p6387 raised [his]_p6388 hand and pointed to the bed, and [his]_p6389 iron face was drawn and ashen white. [I]_p6390 felt [my]_p6391 knees begin to tremble. There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay [poor Lucy]_n,678 more horribly white and wan-looking than ever.",3,,24,
stoker_dracula," Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as [we]_p6392 sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness. [Van Helsing]_n679 raised [his]_p6393 foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of [his]_p6394 life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and [he]_p6395 put [it]_p6396 down again softly. ""Quick!"" [he]_p6397 said. ""Bring the brandy. "" [I]_p6398 flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter. [He]_p6399 wetted the poor white lips with it, and together [we]_p6400 rubbed palm and wrist and heart. [He]_p6401 felt [her]_p6402 heart, and after a few moments of agonising suspense said:,   ""It is not too late. [It]_p6403 beats, though but feebly. All [our]_p6404 work is undone [we]_p6405 must begin again. There is no [young]_n680 [Arthur]_n681 here now [I]_p6406 have to call on [you]_p6407 [yourself]_p6408 this time, friend John.",3,,17,

There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one and so, without a moment's delay, [we]_p6415 began the operation. After a time, [it]_p6416 did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no matter how willingly [it]_p6417 be given, is a terrible feeling, [Van Helsing]_n682 held up a warning finger. ""Do not stir,"" [he]_p6418 said, ""but [I]_p6419 fear that with growing strength [she]_p6420 may wake and that would make danger, oh, so much danger. But [I]_p6421 shall precaution take. [I]_p6422 shall give hypodermic injection of morphia. "" [He]_p6423 proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out [his]_p6424 intent. The effect on [Lucy]_n683 was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep. [It]_p6425 was with a feeling of personal pride that [I]_p6426 could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips. No man knows, till [he]_p6427 experiences it, what [it]_p6429 is to feel [his]_p6431 own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman [he]_p6428 loves.",2,,22,
stoker_dracula," The [Professor]_n684 watched [me]_p6432 critically. ""That will do,"" [he]_p6433 said. ""Already?"" [I]_p6434 remonstrated. ""You took a great deal more from Art.

[You]_p6439 have work, much work, to do for [her]_p6440 and for others and the present will suffice. ""  When [we]_p6441 stopped the operation, [he]_p6442 attended to Lucy, whilst [I]_p6443 applied digital pressure to [my]_p6444 own incision. [I]_p6445 laid down, whilst [I]_p6446 waited [his]_p6448 leisure to attend to me, for [I]_p6446 felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by [he]_p6449 bound up [my]_p6450 wound, and sent [me]_p6451 downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself. As [I]_p6452 was leaving the room, [he]_p6453 came after me, and half whispered:,   ""Mind, nothing must be said of this.",1,,22,
stoker_dracula," If [our]_p6454 [young]_n685 lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him. [It]_p6455 would at once frighten [him]_p6456 and enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!""  When [I]_p6458 came back [he]_p6459 looked at [me]_p6460 carefully, and then said:,   ""You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on [your]_p6461 sofa, and rest awhile then have much breakfast, and come here to me.

[I]_p6466 had done [my]_p6467 part, and now [my]_p6468 next duty was to keep up [my]_p6468 strength. [I]_p6470 felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred. [I]_p6471 fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how [she]_p6472 could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it. [I]_p6473 think [I]_p6474 must have continued [my]_p6475 wonder in [my]_p6476 dreams, for, sleeping and waking, [my]_p6476 thoughts always came back to the little punctures in [her]_p6478 throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of [their]_p6479 edges, tiny though [they]_p6480 were.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," Lucy slept well into the day, and when [she]_p6481 woke [she]_p6482 was fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When [Van Helsing]_n686 had seen her, [he]_p6485 went out for a walk, leaving [me]_p6486 in charge, with strict injunctions that [I]_p6487 was not to leave [her]_p6483 for a moment. [I]_p6488 could hear [his]_p6489 voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office. Lucy chatted with [me]_p6490 freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened. [I]_p6491 tried to keep [her]_p6492 amused and interested. When [her]_p6493 mother came up to see her, [she]_p6495 did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to [me]_p6496 gratefully:, ""We owe [you]_p6497 so much, Dr [Seward]_n,687 for all [you]_p6498 have done, but [you]_p6498 really must now take care not to overwork yourself. [You]_p6500 are looking pale yourself. [You]_p6501 want a wife to nurse and look after [you]_p6502 a bit that [you]_p6503 do!"" As [she]_p6504 spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though [it]_p6505 was only momentarily, for [her]_p6506 poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as [she]_p6507 turned imploring eyes on me. [I]_p6508 smiled and nodded, and laid [my]_p6509 finger on [my]_p6510 lips with a sigh, [she]_p6511 sank back amid [her]_p6512 pillows.",2,,30,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n688 returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: ""Now [you]_p6513 go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make [yourself]_p6514 strong. [I]_p6515 stay here [to-night]_n,689 and [I]_p6516 shall sit up with little miss myself. [You]_p6517 and [I]_p6518 must watch the case, and [we]_p6519 must have none other to know. [I]_p6520 have grave reasons. No, do not ask [them]_p6521 think what [you]_p6522 will. Do not fear to think even the most not-probable. [Good-night]_n690. ""  In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if [they]_p6523 or either of [them]_p6524 might not sit up with Miss Lucy. [They]_p6525 implored [me]_p6526 to let [them]_p6528 and when [I]_p6529 said [it]_p6531 was Dr [Van Helsing]_n's691 wish that either [he]_p6532 or [I]_p6530 should sit up, [they]_p6533 asked [me]_p6527 quite piteously to intercede with the ""foreign gentleman.",4,,21,
stoker_dracula," "" [I]_p6534 was much touched by [their]_p6535 kindness. Perhaps [it]_p6536 is because [I]_p6538 am weak at present, and perhaps because [it]_p6537 was on Lucy's account, that [their]_p6540 devotion was manifested for over and over again have [I]_p6539 seen similar instances of woman's kindness. [I]_p6541 got back here in time for a late dinner went [my]_p6542 rounds, all well and set this down whilst waiting for sleep. [It]_p6543 is coming. * * * * *  11 September. , This afternoon [I]_p6544 went over to [Hillingham]_n692. [Found Van Helsing]_n693 in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after [I]_p6545 had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the [Professor]_n694. [He]_p6546 opened [it]_p6547 with much impressment, assumed, of course, and showed a great bundle of white flowers. ""These are for you, [Miss Lucy]_n,""695 [he]_p6548 said.",4,,15,
stoker_dracula," ""For me? Oh, Dr [Van Helsing]_n!""696 ""Yes, [my]_p6549 [dear]_n,697 but not for [you]_p6550 to play with. These are medicines. "" Here [Lucy]_n698 made a wry face. ""Nay, but [they]_p6551 are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so [you]_p6552 need not snub that so charming nose, or [I]_p6553 shall point out to [my]_p6554 friend [Arthur]_n699 what woes [he]_p6555 may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that [he]_p6556 so loves so much distort. Aha, [my]_p6557 pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but [you]_p6558 do not know how. [I]_p6559 put [him]_p6561 in [your]_p6563 window, [I]_p6560 make pretty wreath, and hang [him]_p6562 round [your]_p6564 neck, so that [you]_p6565 sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the lotus flower, make [your]_p6566 trouble forgotten. [It]_p6567 smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find [him]_p6568 all too late. ""  Whilst [he]_p6569 was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them.",4,,21,
stoker_dracula," Now [she]_p6570 threw [them]_p6571 down, saying, with half-laughter, and half-disgust:, ""Oh, [Professor]_n,700 [I]_p6572 believe [you]_p6573 are only putting up a joke on me. Why, these flowers are only common garlic. "" To [my]_p6574 surprise, [Van Helsing]_n701 rose up and said with all [his]_p6575 sternness, [his]_p6576 iron jaw set and [his]_p6576 bushy eyebrows meeting:, ""No trifling with me! [I]_p6578 never jest! There is grim purpose in all [I]_p6579 do and [I]_p6579 warn [you]_p6581 that [you]_p6582 do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of others if not for [your]_p6583 own. "" Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as [she]_p6584 might well be, [he]_p6585 went on more gently: ""Oh, little miss, [my]_p6586 [dear]_n,702 do not fear me. [I]_p6587 only do for [your]_p6588 good but there is much virtue to [you]_p6589 in those so common flowers. See, [I]_p6590 place [them]_p6591 [myself]_p6592 in [your]_p6593 room. [I]_p6594 make [myself]_p6595 the wreath that [you]_p6596 are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions. [We]_p6597 must obey, and silence is a part of obedience  and obedience is to bring [you]_p6598 strong and well into loving arms that wait for you.",3,,29,
stoker_dracula," Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and [you]_p6602 shall help [me]_p6600 deck the room with [my]_p6603 garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where [my]_p6604 friend Vanderpool raise herb in [his]_p6605 glass-houses all the year. [I]_p6606 had to telegraph yesterday, or [they]_p6607 would not have been here. ""  [We]_p6608 went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The [Professor]_n's703 actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that [I]_p6609 ever heard of. First [he]_p6610 fastened up the windows and latched [them]_p6612 securely next, taking a handful of the flowers, [he]_p6611 rubbed [them]_p6613 all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp [he]_p6614 rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way. [It]_p6615 all seemed grotesque to me, and presently [I]_p6616 said:, ""Well, [Professor]_n,704 [I]_p6617 know [you]_p6618 always have a reason for what [you]_p6619 do, but this certainly puzzles me. [It]_p6620 is well [we]_p6621 have no sceptic here, or [he]_p6622 would say that [you]_p6623 were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit. "" ""Perhaps [I]_p6624 am!"" [he]_p6625 answered quietly as [he]_p6626 began to make the wreath which [Lucy]_n705 was to wear round [her]_p6627 neck.",3,,27,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p6628 then waited whilst Lucy made [her]_p6629 toilet for the night, and when [she]_p6631 was in bed [he]_p6632 came and [himself]_p6633 fixed the wreath of garlic round [her]_p6630 neck. The last words [he]_p6634 said to [her]_p6635 were:, ""Take care [you]_p6636 do not disturb [it]_p6637 and even if the room feel close, do not [to-night]_n706 open the window or the door. "" ""I promise,"" said Lucy, ""and thank [you]_p6642 both a thousand times for all [your]_p6643 kindness to me! Oh, what have [I]_p6638 done to be blessed with such friends?"" As [we]_p6644 left the house in [my]_p6645 fly, which was waiting, [Van Helsing]_n707 said:, ""To-night [I]_p6639 can sleep in peace, and sleep [I]_p6639 want, two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early [you]_p6646 call for me, and [we]_p6647 come together to see [our]_p6648 pretty miss, so much more strong for [my]_p6649 'spell' which [I]_p6650 have work. Ho! ho!""  [He]_p6651 seemed so confident that I, remembering [my]_p6652 own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. [It]_p6653 must have been [my]_p6654 weakness that made [me]_p6656 hesitate to tell [it]_p6657 to [my]_p6655 friend, but [I]_p6659 felt [it]_p6658 all the more, like unshed tears. CHAPTER XI  Lucy Westenra's Diary. 12 September. , How good [they]_p6660 all are to me. [I]_p6661 quite love that [dear]_n708 Dr [Van Helsing]_n709.",4,,33,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p6662 wonder why [he]_p6663 was so anxious about these flowers. [He]_p6664 positively frightened me, [he]_p6665 was so fierce. And yet [he]_p6666 must have been right, for [I]_p6667 feel comfort from [them]_p6668 already. Somehow, [I]_p6669 do not dread being alone to-night, and [I]_p6670 can go to sleep without fear. [I]_p6671 shall not mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that [I]_p6672 have had against sleep so often of late the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as [it]_p6673 has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here [I]_p6674 am [to-night]_n,710 hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with ""virgin crants and maiden strewments. "" [I]_p6675 never liked garlic before, but [to-night]_n711 [it]_p6677 is delightful! There is peace in [its]_p6678 smell [I]_p6676 feel sleep coming already. [Good-night]_n,712 everybody.

stoker_dracula," 13 September. , Called at the [Berkeley]_n715 and found [Van Helsing]_n,716 as usual, up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The [Professor]_n717 took [his]_p6679 bag, which [he]_p6680 always brings with [him]_p6681 now. Let all be put down exactly. [Van Helsing]_n718 and [I]_p6682 arrived at [Hillingham]_n719 at eight o'clock. [It]_p6683 was a lovely morning the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When [we]_p6684 entered [we]_p6685 met Mrs Westenra coming out of the morning room. [She]_p6686 is always an early riser.",5,,8,
stoker_dracula," [She]_p6687 greeted [us]_p6688 warmly and said:, ""You will be glad to know that [Lucy]_n720 is better. The [dear]_n721 child is still asleep. [I]_p6689 looked into [her]_p6691 room and saw her, but did not go in, lest [I]_p6690 should disturb her. "" The [Professor]_n722 smiled, and looked quite jubilant. [He]_p6694 rubbed [his]_p6695 hands together, and said:,   ""Aha! [I]_p6696 thought [I]_p6697 had diagnosed the case. [My]_p6698 treatment is working,"" to which [she]_p6699 answered:,   ""You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. [Lucy]_n's723 state this morning is due in part to me. "" ""How [you]_p6700 do mean, ma'am?"" asked the [Professor]_n724. ""Well, [I]_p6701 was anxious about the [dear]_n725 child in the night, and went into [her]_p6702 room. [She]_p6703 was sleeping soundly, so soundly that even [my]_p6704 coming did not wake her.",6,,16,
stoker_dracula," But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and [she]_p6705 had actually a bunch of [them]_p6706 round [her]_p6707 neck. [I]_p6708 feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the [dear]_n726 child in [her]_p6710 weak state, so [I]_p6709 took [them]_p6711 all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. [You]_p6712 will be pleased with her, [I]_p6713 am sure. ""  [She]_p6714 moved off into [her]_p6715 boudoir, where [she]_p6716 usually breakfasted early. As [she]_p6717 had spoken, [I]_p6718 watched the [Professor]_n's727 face, and saw [it]_p6719 turn ashen grey. [He]_p6720 had been able to retain [his]_p6721 self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for [he]_p6722 knew [her]_p6725 state and how mischievous a shock would be  [he]_p6723 actually smiled on [her]_p6726 as [he]_p6723 held open the door for [her]_p6726 to pass into [her]_p6727 room. But the instant [she]_p6729 had disappeared [he]_p6730 pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door. Then, for the first time in [my]_p6731 life, [I]_p6732 saw [Van Helsing]_n728 break down. [He]_p6733 raised [his]_p6734 hands over [his]_p6735 head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat [his]_p6735 palms together in a helpless way finally [he]_p6740 sat down on a chair, and putting [his]_p6736 hands before [his]_p6736 face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of [his]_p6736 heart.",3,,36,
stoker_dracula," Then [he]_p6741 raised [his]_p6742 arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. ""God! God! God!"" [he]_p6743 said. ""What have [we]_p6744 done, what has this poor thing done, that [we]_p6745 are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst [us]_p6748 still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as [she]_p6749 think, does such thing as lose [her]_p6751 daughter body and soul and [we]_p6745 must not tell her, [we]_p6746 must not even warn her, or [she]_p6750 die, and then both die. Oh, how [we]_p6754 are beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!"" Suddenly [he]_p6755 jumped to [his]_p6756 feet. ""Come,"" [he]_p6757 said, ""come, [we]_p6758 must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, [it]_p6759 matters not [we]_p6760 fight [him]_p6761 all the same. "" [He]_p6762 went to the hall-door for [his]_p6763 bag and together [we]_p6764 went up to Lucy's room. Once again [I]_p6765 drew up the blind, whilst [Van Helsing]_n729 went towards the bed. This time [he]_p6766 did not start as [he]_p6767 looked on the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before. [He]_p6768 wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," ""As [I]_p6769 expected,"" [he]_p6770 murmured, with that hissing inspiration of [his]_p6771 which meant so much. Without a word [he]_p6772 went and locked the door, and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood. [I]_p6773 had long ago recognised the necessity, and begun to take off [my]_p6774 coat, but [he]_p6775 stopped [me]_p6776 with a warning hand. ""No!"" [he]_p6777 said. ""[To-day]_n730 [you]_p6778 must operate. [I]_p6779 shall provide. [You]_p6780 are weakened already. "" As [he]_p6781 spoke [he]_p6782 took off [his]_p6783 coat and rolled up [his]_p6784 shirt-sleeve. Again the operation again the narcotic again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time [I]_p6785 watched whilst [Van Helsing]_n731 recruited [himself]_p6786 and rested.",2,,18,
stoker_dracula," Presently [he]_p6787 took an opportunity of telling Mrs Westenra that [she]_p6788 must not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting [him]_p6789 that the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of [their]_p6790 odour was a part of the system of cure. Then [he]_p6791 took over the care of the case himself, saying that [he]_p6792 would watch this night and the next and would send [me]_p6793 word when to come. After another hour [Lucy]_n732 waked from [her]_p6794 sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for [her]_p6795 terrible ordeal. What does [it]_p6796 all mean? [I]_p6797 am beginning to wonder if [my]_p6798 long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon [my]_p6799 own brain. Lucy Westenra's Diary. 17 September. , [Four]_n733 days and nights of peace. [I]_p6800 am getting so strong again that [I]_p6801 hardly know myself. [It]_p6802 is as if [I]_p6803 had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me. [I]_p6804 have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water.",2,,18,
stoker_dracula," Since, however, Dr [Van Helsing]_n734 has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away the noises that used to frighten [me]_p6805 out of [my]_p6809 wits, the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from [I]_p6810 know not where and commanded [me]_p6806 to do [I]_p6811 know not what, have all ceased. [I]_p6812 go to bed now without any fear of sleep. [I]_p6813 do not even try to keep awake. [I]_p6814 have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for [me]_p6815 every day from Haarlem. [To-night Dr Van Helsing]_n735 is going away, as [he]_p6816 has to be for a day in [Amsterdam]_n736. But [I]_p6817 need not be watched [I]_p6818 am well enough to be left alone. Thank God for mother's sake, and [dear]_n737 [Arthur]_n's,738 and for all [our]_p6819 friends who have been so kind! [I]_p6820 shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr [Van Helsing]_n739 slept in [his]_p6821 chair a lot of the time. [I]_p6822 found [him]_p6825 asleep twice when [I]_p6823 awoke but [I]_p6823 did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the window-panes.

stoker_dracula," [PERILOUS ADVENTURE]_n741 OF OUR INTERVIEWER. Interview with the Keeper in the Zo logical Gardens. After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using the words ""[Pall Mall Gazette]_n""742 as a sort of talisman, [I]_p6826 managed to find the keeper of the section of the Zo logical Gardens in which the wolf department is included. [Thomas Bilder]_n743 lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to [his]_p6827 tea when [I]_p6828 found him. [Thomas]_n744 and [his]_p6829 wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen [I]_p6830 enjoyed of [their]_p6831 hospitality be of the average kind, [their]_p6832 lives must be pretty comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what [he]_p6833 called ""business"" until the supper was over, and [we]_p6834 were all satisfied. Then when the table was cleared, and [he]_p6835 had lit [his]_p6837 pipe, [he]_p6836 said:,   ""Now, sir, [you]_p6838 can go on and arsk [me]_p6840 what [you]_p6839 want.

[He]_p6920 had a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and [I]_p6921 took a sort of mislike to him, for [it]_p6922 seemed as if [it]_p6923 was 'im as [they]_p6924 was hirritated at. [He]_p6925 'ad white kid gloves on 'is 'ands, and [he]_p6926 pointed out the animiles to [me]_p6927 and says: 'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something. '  ""'Maybe it's you,' says I, for [I]_p6928 did not like the airs as [he]_p6930 give 'isself. [He]_p6931 didn't git angry, as [I]_p6932 'oped [he]_p6933 would, but [he]_p6934 smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth.",3,,23,
stoker_dracula," 'Oh no, [they]_p6935 wouldn't like me,' 'e says. ""'Ow yes, [they]_p6936 would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him. 'They always likes a bone or two to clean [their]_p6937 teeth on about tea-time, which [you]_p6938 'as a bagful. ' ""Well, [it]_p6939 was a odd thing, but when the animiles see [us]_p6940 a-talkin' [they]_p6941 lay down, and when [I]_p6942 went over to [Bersicker]_n751 [he]_p6943 let [me]_p6944 stroke [his]_p6945 ears same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if [he]_p6946 didn't put in [his]_p6947 hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too!  ""'Tyke care,' says I. '[Bersicker]_n752 is quick. '  ""'Never mind,' [he]_p6948 says. 'I'm used to 'em!'  ""'Are [you]_p6949 in the business yourself?' [I]_p6950 says, tyking off [my]_p6952 'at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers. ""'No' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but [I]_p6953 'ave made pets of several. ' And with that [he]_p6954 lifts [his]_p6955 'at as perlite as a lord, and walks away.",2,,20,
stoker_dracula," Old [Bersicker]_n753 kep' a-lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight, and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'ole hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves here all began a-'owling. There warn't nothing for [them]_p6956 to 'owl at. There warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin' a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice [I]_p6957 went out to see that all was right, and [it]_p6958 was, and then the 'owling stopped. Just before twelve o'clock [I]_p6959 just took a look round afore turnin' in, an', bust me, but when [I]_p6960 kem opposite to old [Bersicker]_n's754 cage [I]_p6960 see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And that's all [I]_p6962 know for certing. ""  ""Did any one else see anything?""  ""One of [our]_p6963 gard'ners was a-comin' 'ome about that time from a 'armony, when [he]_p6964 sees a big grey dog comin' out through the garding 'edges. At least, so [he]_p6965 says, but [I]_p6968 don't give much for [it]_p6969 myself, for if [he]_p6966 did 'e never said a word about [it]_p6970 to [his]_p6972 missis when 'e got 'ome, and [it]_p6970 was only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and [we]_p6973 had been up all night-a-huntin' of the Park for [Bersicker]_n,755 that [he]_p6966 remembered seein' anything. [My]_p6974 own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into [his]_p6975 'ead.",3,,20,
stoker_dracula," "" ""Now, [Mr Bilder]_n,756 can [you]_p6976 account in any way for the escape of the wolf?"" ""Well, sir,"" [he]_p6978 said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, ""I think [I]_p6979 can but [I]_p6980 don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory. ""  ""Certainly [I]_p6982 shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from experience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?""  ""Well then, sir, [I]_p6983 accounts for [it]_p6984 this way [it]_p6985 seems to [me]_p6986 that 'ere wolf escaped, simply because [he]_p6987 wanted to get out. "" From the hearty way that both [Thomas]_n757 and [his]_p6988 wife laughed at the joke [I]_p6989 could see that [it]_p6990 had done service before, and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell. [I]_p6991 couldn't cope in badinage with the worthy [Thomas]_n,758 but [I]_p6992 thought [I]_p6992 knew a surer way to [his]_p6995 heart, so [I]_p6993 said:, ""Now, [Mr Bilder]_n,759 we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off, and this brother of [his]_p6996 is waiting to be claimed when you've told [me]_p6999 what [you]_p6997 think will happen. ""  ""Right y'are, sir,"" [he]_p7000 said briskly. ""Ye'll excoose me, [I]_p7004 know, for a-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much as telling [me]_p7001 to go on. ""  ""Well, [I]_p7005 never!"" said the old lady. ""My opinion is this: that 'ere wolf is a-'idin' of, somewheres. The gard'ner wot didn't remember said [he]_p7006 was a-gallopin' northward faster than a horse could go but [I]_p7007 don't believe him, for, [yer]_p7008 see, sir, wolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does, [they]_p7009 not [bein]_n'760 built that way.",5,,29,
stoker_dracula," Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and [I]_p7010 dessay when [they]_p7011 gets in packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than [they]_p7012 is [they]_p7012 can make a devil of a noise and chop [it]_p7014 up, whatever [it]_p7015 is. But, [Lor]_n'761 bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fight in 'im. This one ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' for hisself, and more like he's somewhere round the Park a-'idin' an' a-shiverin' of, and, if [he]_p7016 thinks at all, wonderin' where [he]_p7017 is to get [his]_p7020 breakfast from or maybe he's got down some area and is in a coal-cellar. [My]_p7021 eye, won't some cook get a rum start when [she]_p7022 sees [his]_p7023 green eyes a-shining at [her]_p7024 out of the dark! If [he]_p7025 can't get food he's bound to look for it, and mayhap [he]_p7026 may chance to light on a butcher's shop in time. If [he]_p7028 doesn't, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin' orf with a soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator, well, then [I]_p7029 shouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That's all. "" [I]_p7030 was handing [him]_p7031 the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up against the window, and [Mr Bilder]_n's762 face doubled [its]_p7032 natural length with surprise. ""God bless me!"" [he]_p7033 said. ""If there ain't old [Bersicker]_n763 come back by 'isself!"" [He]_p7034 went to the door and opened [it]_p7035 a most unnecessary proceeding [it]_p7036 seemed to me. [I]_p7037 have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between [us]_p7038 a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.",3,,26,
stoker_dracula," After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither [Bilder]_n764 nor [his]_p7039 wife thought any more of the wolf than [I]_p7040 should of a dog. The animal [itself]_p7041 was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all picture-wolves, [Red]_n765 Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving [her]_p7042 confidence in masquerade. The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the children in the town shivering in [their]_p7043 shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son. Old [Bilder]_n766 examined [him]_p7044 all over with most tender solicitude, and when [he]_p7045 had finished with [his]_p7046 penitent said:, ""There, [I]_p7048 knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble didn't [I]_p7049 say [it]_p7050 all along? Here's [his]_p7047 head all cut and full of broken glass. 'E's been a-gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other. It's a shyme that people are allowed to top [their]_p7051 walls with broken bottles. This 'ere's what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker. ""  [He]_p7052 took the wolf and locked [him]_p7053 up in a cage, with a piece of meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the fatted calf, and went off to report.",3,,15,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p7054 came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo. [Dr Seward]_n's767 [Diary]_n768. 17 September. , [I]_p7055 was engaged after dinner in [my]_p7056 study posting up [my]_p7057 books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in rushed [my]_p7058 patient, with [his]_p7059 face distorted with passion. [I]_p7060 was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of [his]_p7061 own accord into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's pause [he]_p7062 made straight at me. [He]_p7063 had a dinner-knife in [his]_p7064 hand, and, as [I]_p7065 saw [he]_p7067 was dangerous, [I]_p7066 tried to keep the table between us. [He]_p7068 was too quick and too strong for me, however for before [I]_p7071 could get [my]_p7072 balance [he]_p7074 had struck at [me]_p7069 and cut [my]_p7073 left wrist rather severely. Before [he]_p7075 could strike again, however, [I]_p7077 got in [my]_p7078 right and [he]_p7076 was sprawling on [his]_p7079 back on the floor.",2,,25,
stoker_dracula," [My]_p7080 wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet. [I]_p7081 saw that [my]_p7082 friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied [myself]_p7084 binding up [my]_p7083 wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, and [we]_p7085 turned [our]_p7086 attention to him, [his]_p7087 employment positively sickened me. [He]_p7088 was lying on [his]_p7089 belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from [my]_p7090 wounded wrist. [He]_p7091 was easily secured, and, to [my]_p7092 surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again: ""The blood is the life! The blood is the life!""  [I]_p7094 cannot afford to lose blood just at present [I]_p7095 have lost too much of late for [my]_p7093 physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy's illness and [its]_p7096 horrible phases is telling on me. [I]_p7097 am over-excited and weary, and [I]_p7098 need [rest]_n,769 [rest][_n, ]_nrest770. [Happily]_n771 [Van Helsing]_n772 has not summoned me, so [I]_p7099 need not forego [my]_p7101 sleep [to-night]_n773 [I]_p7100 could not well do without it.

The arrival of [Van Helsing]_n's781 telegram filled [me]_p7103 with dismay. A whole night lost, and [I]_p7104 know by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course [it]_p7105 is possible that all may be well, but what may have happened? Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over [us]_p7106 that every possible accident should thwart [us]_p7107 in all [we]_p7108 try to do. [I]_p7109 shall take this cylinder with me, and then [I]_p7110 can complete [my]_p7111 entry on Lucy's phonograph.",6,,10,
stoker_dracula," Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra. 17 September. Night. , [I]_p7112 write this and leave [it]_p7113 to be seen, so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact record of what took place [to-night]_n782. [I]_p7114 feel [I]_p7115 am dying of weakness, and have barely strength to write, but [it]_p7117 must be done if [I]_p7115 die in the doing. [I]_p7118 went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr [Van Helsing]_n783 directed, and soon fell asleep. [I]_p7119 was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now [I]_p7120 know so well. [I]_p7121 was not afraid, but [I]_p7122 did wish that [Dr Seward]_n784 was in the next room, as Dr [Van Helsing]_n785 said [he]_p7124 would be, so that [I]_p7122 might have called him. [I]_p7125 tried to go to sleep, but could not.",4,,14,
stoker_dracula," Then there came to [me]_p7126 the old fear of sleep, and [I]_p7127 determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep would try to come then when [I]_p7128 did not want [it]_p7131 so, as [I]_p7129 feared to be alone, [I]_p7129 opened [my]_p7132 door and called out: ""Is there anybody there?"" There was no answer. [I]_p7133 was afraid to wake mother, and so closed [my]_p7134 door again. Then outside in the shrubbery [I]_p7135 heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but more fierce and deeper. [I]_p7136 went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting [its]_p7137 wings against the window. So [I]_p7138 went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in  seeing by [my]_p7139 moving that [I]_p7140 was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. [She]_p7141 said to [me]_p7142 even more sweetly and softly than [her]_p7143 wont:,   ""I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that [you]_p7144 were all right. ""  [I]_p7146 feared [she]_p7147 might catch cold sitting there, and asked [her]_p7152 to come in and sleep with me, so [she]_p7148 came into bed, and lay down beside [me]_p7155 [she]_p7148 did not take off [her]_p7153 dressing gown, for [she]_p7149 said [she]_p7149 would only stay a while and then go back to [her]_p7153 own bed. As [she]_p7157 lay there in [my]_p7158 arms, and [I]_p7159 in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again.",0,,32,
stoker_dracula," [She]_p7160 was startled and a little frightened, and cried out: ""What is that?"" [I]_p7161 tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and [she]_p7165 lay quiet but [I]_p7162 could hear [her]_p7163 poor [dear]_n786 heart still beating terribly. After a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey wolf. [Mother]_n787 cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst other things, [she]_p7166 clutched the wreath of flowers that [Dr Van Helsing]_n788 insisted on [my]_p7167 wearing round [my]_p7168 neck, and tore [it]_p7169 away from me. For a second or two [she]_p7170 sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in [her]_p7172 throat then [she]_p7171 fell over, as if struck with lightning, and [her]_p7173 head hit [my]_p7174 forehead and made [me]_p7175 dizzy for a moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. [I]_p7176 kept [my]_p7177 eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew [his]_p7178 head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. [I]_p7179 tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and [dear]_n789 mother's poor body, which seemed to grow cold already, for [her]_p7183 [dear]_n790 heart had ceased to beat, weighed [me]_p7181 down and [I]_p7180 remembered no more for a while. The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till [I]_p7184 recovered consciousness again.",5,,23,
stoker_dracula," Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling and in [our]_p7185 shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. [I]_p7186 was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of [my]_p7187 dead mother come back to comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for [I]_p7188 could hear [their]_p7189 bare feet pattering outside [my]_p7190 door. [I]_p7191 called to them, and [they]_p7192 came in, and when [they]_p7193 saw what had happened, and what [it]_p7195 was that lay over [me]_p7196 on the bed, [they]_p7193 screamed out. The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to. [They]_p7197 lifted off the body of [my]_p7198 [dear]_n791 mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after [I]_p7199 had got up. [They]_p7200 were all so frightened and nervous that [I]_p7201 directed [them]_p7202 to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining-room and [I]_p7203 laid what flowers [I]_p7204 had on [my]_p7205 [dear]_n792 mother's breast. When [they]_p7206 were there [I]_p7207 remembered what Dr [Van Helsing]_n793 had told me, but [I]_p7208 didn't like to remove them, and, besides, [I]_p7208 would have some of the servants to sit up with [me]_p7210 now.",3,,26,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p7212 was surprised that the maids did not come back. [I]_p7213 called them, but got no answer, so [I]_p7214 went to the dining-room to look for them. [My]_p7215 heart sank when [I]_p7216 saw what had happened. [They]_p7217 all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. [I]_p7218 was suspicious, and examined the decanter. [It]_p7219 smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, [I]_p7220 found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for her, oh! did use, was empty. What am [I]_p7221 to do? what am [I]_p7222 to do? [I]_p7222 am back in the room with mother. [I]_p7224 cannot leave her, and [I]_p7225 am alone, [save]_n794 for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! [I]_p7226 dare not go out, for [I]_p7227 can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window.",1,,16,
stoker_dracula," The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am [I]_p7228 to do? God shield [me]_p7230 from harm this night! [I]_p7229 shall hide this paper in [my]_p7232 breast, where [they]_p7233 shall find [it]_p7235 when [they]_p7234 come to lay [me]_p7231 out. [My]_p7236 [dear]_n795 mother gone! [It]_p7237 is time that [I]_p7238 go too. Good-bye, [dear]_n796 [Arthur]_n,797 if [I]_p7239 should not survive this night. God keep you, [dear]_n,798 and God help me! CHAPTER XII [DR]_n799. SEWARD'S [DIARY]_n800 18 September. , [I]_p7240 drove at once to [Hillingham]_n801 and arrived early. Keeping [my]_p7241 cab at the gate, [I]_p7242 went up the avenue alone. [I]_p7243 knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for [I]_p7244 feared to disturb Lucy or [her]_p7245 mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while, finding no response, [I]_p7246 knocked and rang again still no answer.",7,,19,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p7247 cursed the laziness of the servants that [they]_p7248 should lie abed at such an hour, for [it]_p7249 was now ten o'clock, and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto [I]_p7250 had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us? Was [it]_p7251 indeed a house of death to which [I]_p7252 had come, too late? [I]_p7253 knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if [she]_p7256 had had again one of those frightful relapses  and [I]_p7253 went round the house to try if [I]_p7254 could find by chance an entry anywhere. [I]_p7257 could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and locked, and [I]_p7258 returned baffled to the porch. As [I]_p7259 did so, [I]_p7260 heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. [They]_p7261 stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later [I]_p7262 met [Van Helsing]_n802 running up the avenue. When [he]_p7263 saw me, [he]_p7264 gasped out:,   ""Then [it]_p7265 was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are [we]_p7266 too late? Did [you]_p7267 not get [my]_p7268 telegram?""  [I]_p7269 answered as quickly and coherently as [I]_p7270 could that [I]_p7270 had only got [his]_p7273 telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here, and that [I]_p7271 could not make any one in the house hear me. [He]_p7274 paused and raised [his]_p7275 hat as [he]_p7276 said solemnly:,   ""Then [I]_p7277 fear [we]_p7278 are too late.",1,,32,
stoker_dracula," God's will be done!"" With [his]_p7279 usual recuperative energy, [he]_p7280 went on: ""Come. If there be no way open to get in, [we]_p7281 must make one. Time is all in all to [us]_p7282 now. ""  [We]_p7283 went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window. The [Professor]_n803 took a small surgical saw from [his]_p7284 case, and handing [it]_p7285 to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. [I]_p7286 attacked [them]_p7287 at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife [we]_p7289 pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window. [I]_p7290 helped the [Professor]_n804 in, and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at hand. [We]_p7291 tried all the rooms as [we]_p7292 went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor.",2,,13,
stoker_dracula," There was no need to think [them]_p7293 dead, for [their]_p7294 stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to [their]_p7295 condition. [Van Helsing]_n805 and [I]_p7296 looked at each other, and as [we]_p7297 moved away [he]_p7298 said: ""We can attend to [them]_p7299 later. "" Then [we]_p7300 ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two [we]_p7301 paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that [we]_p7302 could hear. With white faces and trembling hands, [we]_p7303 opened the door gently, and entered the room. How shall [I]_p7304 describe what [we]_p7305 saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and [her]_p7306 mother. The latter lay farthest in, and [she]_p7307 was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it. By [her]_p7308 side lay [Lucy]_n,806 with face white and still more drawn. The flowers which had been round [her]_p7309 neck [we]_p7312 found upon [her]_p7310 mother's bosom, and [her]_p7310 throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which [we]_p7313 had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled. Without a word the [Professor]_n807 bent over the bed, [his]_p7314 head almost touching poor Lucy's breast then [he]_p7317 gave a quick turn of [his]_p7315 head, as of one who listens, and leaping to [his]_p7315 feet, [he]_p7318 cried out to me:, ""It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!"" [I]_p7319 flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which [I]_p7320 found on the table.",3,,28,
stoker_dracula," The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and [I]_p7321 fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. [I]_p7322 did not stay to make sure, but returned to [Van Helsing]_n808. [He]_p7323 rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on [her]_p7324 lips and gums and on [her]_p7325 wrists and the palms of [her]_p7325 hands. [He]_p7327 said to me:,   ""I can do this, all that can be at the present. [You]_p7328 go wake those maids. Flick [them]_p7329 in the face with a wet towel, and flick [them]_p7330 hard. Make [them]_p7331 get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her. [She]_p7332 will need be heated before [we]_p7333 can do anything more. ""  [I]_p7334 went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women.",1,,14,
stoker_dracula," The fourth was only a [young]_n809 girl, and the drug had evidently affected [her]_p7335 more strongly, so [I]_p7338 lifted [her]_p7336 on the sofa and let [her]_p7336 sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to [them]_p7339 [they]_p7340 cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. [I]_p7341 was stern with them, however, and would not let [them]_p7342 talk. [I]_p7344 told [them]_p7345 that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if [they]_p7346 delayed [they]_p7347 would sacrifice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, [they]_p7348 went about [their]_p7350 way, half clad as [they]_p7349 were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. [We]_p7351 got a bath and carried [Lucy]_n810 out as [she]_p7352 was and placed [her]_p7353 in it. Whilst [we]_p7354 were busy chafing [her]_p7355 limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then [she]_p7356 returned and whispered to [us]_p7357 that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr Holmwood.",2,,22,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p7358 bade [her]_p7359 simply tell [him]_p7360 that [he]_p7361 must wait, for [we]_p7362 could see no one now. [She]_p7363 went away with the message, and, engrossed with [our]_p7364 work, [I]_p7365 clean forgot all about him. [I]_p7366 never saw in all [my]_p7367 experience the [Professor]_n811 work in such deadly earnest. [I]_p7368 knew, as [he]_p7369 knew, that [it]_p7370 was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told [him]_p7371 so. [He]_p7372 answered [me]_p7373 in a way that [I]_p7374 did not understand, but with the sternest look that [his]_p7377 face could wear:,   ""If that were all, [I]_p7375 would stop here where [we]_p7378 are now, and let [her]_p7379 fade away into peace, for [I]_p7375 see no light in life over [her]_p7380 horizon. "" [He]_p7381 went on with [his]_p7382 work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour. Presently [we]_p7383 both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and [her]_p7384 lungs had a perceptible movement. [Van Helsing]_n's812 face almost beamed, and as [we]_p7385 lifted [her]_p7386 from the bath and rolled [her]_p7387 in a hot sheet to dry [her]_p7387 [he]_p7391 said to me:, ""The first gain is ours! Check to the King!"" [We]_p7392 took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid [her]_p7388 in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down [her]_p7388 throat. [I]_p7393 noticed that [Van Helsing]_n813 tied a soft silk handkerchief round [her]_p7394 throat.",3,,37,
stoker_dracula," [She]_p7395 was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, [we]_p7396 had ever seen her. [Van Helsing]_n814 called in one of the women, and told [her]_p7397 to stay with [her]_p7398 and not to take [her]_p7398 eyes off [her]_p7399 till [we]_p7401 returned, and then beckoned [me]_p7402 out of the room. ""We must consult as to what is to be done,"" [he]_p7403 said as [we]_p7404 descended the stairs. In the hall [he]_p7405 opened the dining-room door, and [we]_p7407 passed in, [he]_p7406 closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the [British]_n815 woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. [It]_p7408 was, however, light enough for [our]_p7409 purposes. [Van Helsing]_n's816 sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity. [He]_p7410 was evidently torturing [his]_p7411 mind about something, so [I]_p7412 waited for an instant, and [he]_p7413 spoke:,   ""What are [we]_p7414 to do now? Where are [we]_p7415 to turn for help? [We]_p7416 must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life won't be worth an hour's purchase. [You]_p7417 are exhausted already [I]_p7418 am exhausted too.",3,,24,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p7419 fear to trust those women, even if [they]_p7420 would have courage to submit. What are [we]_p7421 to do for some one who will open [his]_p7422 veins for her?"" ""What's the matter with me, anyhow?"" The voice came from the sofa across the room, and [its]_p7423 tones brought relief and joy to [my]_p7424 heart, for [they]_p7425 were those of [Quincey]_n817 Morris. [Van Helsing]_n818 started angrily at the first sound, but [his]_p7426 face softened and a glad look came into [his]_p7427 eyes as [I]_p7428 cried out: ""[Quincey]_n819 Morris!"" and rushed towards [him]_p7429 with outstretched hands. ""What brought [you]_p7430 here?"" [I]_p7431 cried as [our]_p7432 hands met. ""I guess [Art]_n820 is the cause. "" [He]_p7433 handed [me]_p7434 a telegram:, ""Have not heard from [Seward]_n821 for three days, and am terribly anxious. Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send [me]_p7435 word how Lucy is. Do not delay.",5,,17,
stoker_dracula," , HOLMWOOD. ""  ""I think [I]_p7436 came just in the nick of time. [You]_p7438 know [you]_p7439 have only to tell [me]_p7440 what to do. "" [Van Helsing]_n822 strode forward, and took [his]_p7441 hand, looking [him]_p7442 straight in the eyes as [he]_p7443 said:, ""A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against [us]_p7444 for all he's worth, but God sends [us]_p7445 men when [we]_p7446 want them. ""  Once again [we]_p7447 went through that ghastly operation. [I]_p7448 have not the heart to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and [it]_p7449 told on [her]_p7450 more than before, for though plenty of blood went into [her]_p7451 veins, [her]_p7451 body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions. [Her]_p7453 struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear.",1,,17,
stoker_dracula," However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and [Van Helsing]_n823 made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect. [Her]_p7454 faint became a profound slumber. The [Professor]_n824 watched whilst [I]_p7455 went downstairs with [Quincey]_n825 Morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. [I]_p7456 left [Quincey]_n826 lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and [I]_p7457 went back to the room where Lucy now was. When [I]_p7458 came softly in, [I]_p7459 found [Van Helsing]_n827 with a sheet or two of note-paper in [his]_p7460 hand. [He]_p7461 had evidently read it, and was thinking [it]_p7462 over as [he]_p7464 sat with [his]_p7465 hand to [his]_p7466 brow. There was a look of grim satisfaction in [his]_p7467 face, as of one who has had a doubt solved. [He]_p7468 handed [me]_p7469 the paper saying only: ""It dropped from Lucy's breast when [we]_p7470 carried [her]_p7471 to the bath. "" When [I]_p7472 had read it, [I]_p7473 stood looking at the [Professor]_n,828 and after a pause asked him: ""In God's name, what does [it]_p7476 all mean? Was she, or is she, mad or what sort of horrible danger is it?"" [I]_p7473 was so bewildered that [I]_p7474 did not know what to say more.",6,,22,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n829 put out [his]_p7479 hand and took the paper, saying:, ""Do not trouble about [it]_p7480 now. Forget [it]_p7481 for the present. [You]_p7482 shall know and understand [it]_p7483 all in good time but [it]_p7484 will be later. And now what is [it]_p7485 that [you]_p7486 came to [me]_p7487 to say?"" This brought [me]_p7488 back to fact, and [I]_p7489 was all [myself]_p7490 again. ""I came to speak about the certificate of death. If [we]_p7491 do not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced. [I]_p7492 am in hopes that [we]_p7493 need have no inquest, for if [we]_p7494 had [it]_p7495 would surely kill [poor Lucy]_n,830 if nothing else did. [I]_p7496 know, and [you]_p7497 know, and the other doctor who attended [her]_p7498 knows, that Mrs Westenra had disease of the heart, and [we]_p7499 can certify that [she]_p7500 died of it. Let [us]_p7501 fill up the certificate at once, and [I]_p7502 shall take [it]_p7503 [myself]_p7504 to the registrar and go on to the undertaker. "" ""Good, oh [my]_p7505 friend John! Well thought of! [Truly]_n831 Miss Lucy, if [she]_p7506 be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that love her.",3,,28,
stoker_dracula," One, two, three, all open [their]_p7507 veins for her, besides one old man. Ah yes, [I]_p7508 know, friend John [I]_p7509 am not blind! [I]_p7509 love [you]_p7511 all the more for it! Now go. "" In the hall [I]_p7512 met [Quincey]_n832 Morris, with a telegram for [Arthur]_n833 telling [him]_p7514 that Mrs Westenra was dead that Lucy also had been ill, but was now going on better and that [Van Helsing]_n834 and [I]_p7513 were with her. [I]_p7515 told [him]_p7520 where [I]_p7516 was going, and [he]_p7521 hurried [me]_p7522 out, but as [I]_p7516 was going said:, ""When [you]_p7523 come back, [Jack]_n,835 may [I]_p7517 have two words with [you]_p7524 all to ourselves?"" [I]_p7517 nodded in reply and went out. [I]_p7525 found no difficulty about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements. When [I]_p7526 got back [Quincey]_n836 was waiting for me. [I]_p7527 told [him]_p7530 [I]_p7528 would see [him]_p7531 as soon as [I]_p7528 knew about Lucy, and went up to [her]_p7532 room. [She]_p7533 was still sleeping, and the [Professor]_n837 seemingly had not moved from [his]_p7534 seat at [her]_p7535 side. From [his]_p7536 putting [his]_p7537 finger to [his]_p7537 lips, [I]_p7539 gathered that [he]_p7540 expected [her]_p7541 to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature. So [I]_p7542 went down to [Quincey]_n838 and took [him]_p7543 into the breakfast-room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms.",7,,37,
stoker_dracula," When [we]_p7544 were alone, [he]_p7545 said to me:, ""[Jack]_n839 [Seward]_n,840 [I]_p7546 don't want to shove [myself]_p7548 in anywhere where I've no right to be but this is no ordinary case. [You]_p7549 know [I]_p7550 loved that girl and wanted to marry [her]_p7552 but, although that's all past and gone, [I]_p7551 can't help feeling anxious about [her]_p7553 all the same. What is [it]_p7554 that's wrong with her? The Dutchman, and a fine old fellow [he]_p7555 is [I]_p7557 can see that, said, that time [you]_p7558 two came into the room, that [you]_p7559 must have another transfusion of blood, and that both [you]_p7559 and [he]_p7556 were exhausted. Now [I]_p7561 know well that [you]_p7562 medical men speak in camera, and that a man must not expect to know what [they]_p7563 consult about in private. But this is no common matter, and, whatever [it]_p7564 is, [I]_p7565 have done [my]_p7566 part. Is not that so?"" ""That's so,"" [I]_p7567 said, and [he]_p7570 went on:, ""I take [it]_p7571 that both [you]_p7572 and [Van Helsing]_n841 had done already what [I]_p7568 did to-day. Is not that so?""  ""That's so. "" ""And [I]_p7573 guess [Art]_n842 was in [it]_p7574 too. When [I]_p7575 saw [him]_p7576 four days ago down at [his]_p7577 own place [he]_p7578 looked queer. [I]_p7579 have not seen anything pulled down so quick since [I]_p7580 was on the Pampas and had a mare that [I]_p7580 was fond of go to grass all in a night.",4,,36,
stoker_dracula," One of those big bats that [they]_p7582 call vampires had got at [her]_p7583 in the night, and what with [his]_p7587 gorge and the vein left open, there wasn't enough blood in [her]_p7584 to let [her]_p7584 stand up, and [I]_p7588 had to put a bullet through [her]_p7585 as [she]_p7589 lay. [Jack]_n,843 if [you]_p7590 may tell [me]_p7591 without betraying confidence, [Arthur]_n844 was the first, is not that so?"" As [he]_p7592 spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. [He]_p7593 was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman [he]_p7594 loved, and [his]_p7595 utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround [her]_p7597 intensified [his]_p7596 pain. [His]_p7598 very heart was bleeding, and [it]_p7599 took all the manhood of him, and there was a royal lot of it, too, to keep [him]_p7601 from breaking down. [I]_p7603 paused before answering, for [I]_p7604 felt that [I]_p7604 must not betray anything which the [Professor]_n845 wished kept secret but already [he]_p7607 knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so [I]_p7605 answered in the same phrase: ""That's so. ""  ""And how long has this been going on?""  ""About ten days. "" ""Ten days! Then [I]_p7608 guess, [Jack]_n846 [Seward]_n,847 that that poor pretty creature that [we]_p7609 all love has had put into [her]_p7610 veins within that time the blood of four strong men. Man alive, [her]_p7611 whole body wouldn't hold it. "" Then, coming close to me, [he]_p7612 spoke in a fierce half-whisper: ""What took [it]_p7613 out?""  [I]_p7614 shook [my]_p7615 head. ""That,"" [I]_p7616 said, ""is the crux.",5,,33,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n848 is simply frantic about it, and [I]_p7617 am at [my]_p7618 wits' end. [I]_p7619 can't even hazard a guess. There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all [our]_p7620 calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again. Here [we]_p7621 stay until all be well, or ill. "" [Quincey]_n849 held out [his]_p7622 hand. ""Count [me]_p7623 in,"" [he]_p7624 said. ""You and the Dutchman will tell [me]_p7625 what to do, and I'll do it. "" When [she]_p7626 woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel in [her]_p7627 breast, and, to [my]_p7628 surprise, produced the paper which [Van Helsing]_n850 had given [me]_p7629 to read. The careful [Professor]_n851 had replaced [it]_p7630 where [it]_p7631 had come from, lest on waking [she]_p7632 should be alarmed.",4,,16,
stoker_dracula," [Her]_p7633 eye then lit on [Van Helsing]_n852 and on [me]_p7634 too, and gladdened. Then [she]_p7635 looked around the room, and seeing where [she]_p7636 was, shuddered [she]_p7636 gave a loud cry, and put [her]_p7638 poor thin hands before [her]_p7639 pale face. [We]_p7640 both understood what that meant, that [she]_p7641 had realised to the full [her]_p7642 mother's death so [we]_p7644 tried what [we]_p7645 could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased [her]_p7646 somewhat, but [she]_p7647 was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time. [We]_p7648 told [her]_p7649 that either or both of [us]_p7652 would now remain with [her]_p7650 all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk [she]_p7653 fell into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep [she]_p7654 took the paper from [her]_p7655 breast and tore [it]_p7656 in two. [Van Helsing]_n853 stepped over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, [she]_p7657 went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in [her]_p7659 hands finally [she]_p7658 lifted [her]_p7660 hands and opened [them]_p7661 as though scattering the fragments.",2,,27,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n854 seemed surprised, and [his]_p7662 brows gathered as if in thought, but [he]_p7663 said nothing. * * * * *  19 September. , All last night [she]_p7664 slept fitfully, being always afraid to sleep, and something weaker when [she]_p7665 woke from it. The [Professor]_n855 and [I]_p7666 took [it]_p7667 in turns to watch, and [we]_p7668 never left [her]_p7669 for a moment unattended. [Quincey]_n856 Morris said nothing about [his]_p7670 intention, but [I]_p7671 knew that all night long [he]_p7672 patrolled round and round the house. When the day came, [its]_p7673 searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's strength. [She]_p7674 was hardly able to turn [her]_p7675 head, and the little nourishment which [she]_p7677 could take seemed to do [her]_p7676 no good. At times [she]_p7678 slept, and both [Van Helsing]_n857 and [I]_p7679 noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep [she]_p7680 looked stronger, although more haggard, and [her]_p7683 breathing was softer [her]_p7684 open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual when [she]_p7681 woke the softness of [her]_p7684 eyes evidently changed the expression, for [she]_p7681 looked [her]_p7685 own self, although a dying one. In the afternoon [she]_p7687 asked for [Arthur]_n,858 and [we]_p7688 telegraphed for him.",5,,27,
stoker_dracula," [Quincey]_n859 went off to meet [him]_p7689 at the station. When [he]_p7690 arrived [it]_p7691 was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks. When [he]_p7692 saw her, [Arthur]_n860 was simply choking with emotion, and none of [us]_p7693 could speak. In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened. [Arthur]_n's861 presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant [she]_p7694 rallied a little, and spoke to [him]_p7696 more brightly than [she]_p7695 had done since [we]_p7697 arrived. [He]_p7698 too pulled [himself]_p7699 together, and spoke as cheerily as [he]_p7700 could, so that the best was made of everything. [It]_p7701 was now nearly one o'clock, and [he]_p7702 and [Van Helsing]_n862 are sitting with her. [I]_p7703 am to relieve [them]_p7705 in a quarter of an hour, and [I]_p7704 am entering this on Lucy's phonograph. Until six o'clock [they]_p7706 are to try to [rest]_n863. [I]_p7707 fear that to-morrow will end [our]_p7708 watching, for the shock has been too great the poor child cannot rally.",5,,20,

Well, [I]_p7717 got [my]_p7718 husband back all right when [we]_p7719 arrived at [Exeter]_n864 there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though [he]_p7720 had an attack of gout, Mr Hawkins. [He]_p7721 took [us]_p7722 to [his]_p7724 house, where there were rooms for [us]_p7723 all nice and comfortable, and [we]_p7725 dined together. After dinner Mr Hawkins said:,   ""'My dears, [I]_p7726 want to drink [your]_p7727 health and prosperity and may every blessing attend [you]_p7728 both.

""So here [we]_p7742 are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both [my]_p7743 bedroom and the drawing-room [I]_p7744 can see the great elms of the cathedral close, with [their]_p7746 great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and [I]_p7745 can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks, and humans. [I]_p7747 am busy, [I]_p7748 need not tell you, arranging things and housekeeping.

[He]_p7755 is beginning to put some flesh on [his]_p7756 bones again, but [he]_p7759 was terribly weakened by the long illness even now [he]_p7760 sometimes starts out of [his]_p7757 sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until [I]_p7761 can coax [him]_p7762 back to [his]_p7757 usual placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and [they]_p7763 will in time pass away altogether, [I]_p7764 trust.",4,,33,
stoker_dracula," And now [I]_p7765 have told [you]_p7766 [my]_p7767 news, let [me]_p7768 ask yours. When are [you]_p7769 to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are [you]_p7770 to wear, and is [it]_p7772 to be a public or a private wedding? Tell [me]_p7774 all about it, [dear]_n869 tell [me]_p7775 all about everything, for there is nothing which interests [you]_p7770 which will not be [dear]_n870 to me. Jonathan asks [me]_p7777 to send [his]_p7780 'respectful duty,' but [I]_p7782 do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker and so, as [you]_p7785 love me, and [he]_p7788 loves me, and [I]_p7783 love [you]_p7786 with all the moods and tenses of the verb, [I]_p7783 send [you]_p7786 simply [his]_p7781 'love' instead.

stoker_dracula," D. ""20 September. ""My [dear]_n873 Sir,, ""In accordance with [your]_p7790 wishes, [I]_p7791 enclose report of the conditions of everything left in [my]_p7792 charge. With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say. [He]_p7793 has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as [it]_p7794 fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours, the house to which, [you]_p7795 will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at [our]_p7796 gate to ask the porter [their]_p7797 way, as [they]_p7798 were strangers. [I]_p7799 was [myself]_p7800 looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of [them]_p7801 come up to the house. As [he]_p7802 passed the window of Renfield's room, the patient began to rate [him]_p7804 from within, and called [him]_p7805 all the foul names [he]_p7803 could lay [his]_p7806 tongue to. The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented [himself]_p7807 by telling [him]_p7808 to ""shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar,"" whereon [our]_p7813 man accused [him]_p7809 of robbing [him]_p7809 and wanting to murder [him]_p7810 and said that [he]_p7814 would hinder [him]_p7810 if [he]_p7815 were to swing for it.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p7816 opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so [he]_p7818 contented [himself]_p7820 after looking the place over and making up [his]_p7821 mind as to what kind of a place [he]_p7819 had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless yer, sir, [I]_p7817 wouldn't mind what was said to [me]_p7822 in a bloomin' madhouse. [I]_p7823 pity [ye]_p7824 and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild beast like that. ' Then [he]_p7825 asked [his]_p7827 way civilly enough, and [I]_p7828 told [him]_p7829 where the gate of the empty house was [he]_p7826 went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from [our]_p7830 man. [I]_p7831 went down to see if [I]_p7832 could make out any cause for [his]_p7833 anger, since [he]_p7835 is usually such a well-behaved man, and except [his]_p7834 violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. [I]_p7836 found him, to [my]_p7837 astonishment, quite composed and most genial in [his]_p7838 manner. [I]_p7839 tried to get [him]_p7841 to talk of the incident, but [he]_p7842 blandly asked [me]_p7844 questions as to what [I]_p7840 meant, and led [me]_p7845 to believe that [he]_p7843 was completely oblivious of the affair. [It]_p7846 was, [I]_p7847 am sorry to say, however, only another instance of [his]_p7849 cunning, for within half an hour [I]_p7848 heard of [him]_p7850 again. This time [he]_p7851 had broken out through the window of [his]_p7852 room, and was running down the avenue. [I]_p7853 called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for [I]_p7854 feared [he]_p7855 was intent on some mischief. [My]_p7856 fear was justified when [I]_p7857 saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on [it]_p7858 some great wooden boxes.",0,,43,
stoker_dracula," The men were wiping [their]_p7859 foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise. Before [I]_p7860 could get up to [him]_p7861 the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of [them]_p7862 off the cart, began to knock [his]_p7864 head against the ground. If [I]_p7865 had not seized [him]_p7867 just at the moment [I]_p7866 believe [he]_p7868 would have killed the man there and then. The other fellow jumped down and struck [him]_p7869 over the head with the butt-end of [his]_p7870 heavy whip. [It]_p7871 was a terrible blow but [he]_p7872 did not seem to mind it, but seized [him]_p7873 also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling [us]_p7874 to and fro as if [we]_p7876 were kittens. [You]_p7877 know [I]_p7878 am no light weight, and the others were both burly men. At first [he]_p7879 was silent in [his]_p7881 fighting but as [we]_p7882 began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, [he]_p7880 began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! [They]_p7883 shan't rob me! [they]_p7886 shan't murder [me]_p7884 by inches! I'll fight for [my]_p7887 [Lord]_n874 and Master!' and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. [It]_p7888 was with very considerable difficulty that [they]_p7889 got [him]_p7890 back to the house and put [him]_p7891 in the padded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, [I]_p7892 set [it]_p7893 all right and [he]_p7894 is going on well.",1,,33,
stoker_dracula," ""The two carriers were at first loud in [their]_p7895 threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. [Their]_p7896 threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of [them]_p7897 by a feeble madman. [They]_p7898 said that if [it]_p7899 had not been for the way [their]_p7900 strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart [they]_p7901 would have made short work of him. [They]_p7902 gave as another reason for [their]_p7903 defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which [they]_p7906 had been reduced by the dusty nature of [their]_p7904 occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of [their]_p7904 labours of any place of public entertainment. [I]_p7907 quite understood [their]_p7908 drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, [they]_p7909 made light of the attack, and swore that [they]_p7910 would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as [your]_p7911 correspondent. [I]_p7912 took [their]_p7913 names and addresses, in case [they]_p7914 might be needed.

Some may not think [it]_p7919 so sad for us, but [we]_p7921 had both come to so love [him]_p7923 that [it]_p7920 really seems as though [we]_p7922 had lost a father. [I]_p7924 never knew either father or mother, so that the [dear]_n877 old man's death is a real blow to me. [Jonathan]_n878 is greatly distressed. [It]_p7925 is not only that [he]_p7926 feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the [dear]_n,879 good man who has befriended [him]_p7927 all [his]_p7930 life, and now at the end has treated [him]_p7928 like [his]_p7931 own son and left [him]_p7928 a fortune which to people of [our]_p7932 modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels [it]_p7933 on another account. [He]_p7934 says the amount of responsibility which [it]_p7935 puts upon [him]_p7936 makes [him]_p7937 nervous.",3,,19,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p7938 begins to doubt himself. [I]_p7939 try to cheer [him]_p7940 up, and [my]_p7943 belief in [him]_p7941 helps [him]_p7941 to have a belief in himself. But [it]_p7944 is here that the grave shock that [he]_p7945 experienced tells upon [him]_p7946 the most. Oh, [it]_p7947 is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his, a nature which enabled [him]_p7948 by [our]_p7949 [dear]_n,880 good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years, should be so injured that the very essence of [its]_p7950 strength is gone.

[I]_p7958 dread coming up to London, as [we]_p7959 must do the day after to-morrow for poor [Mr Hawkins]_n884 left in [his]_p7960 will that [he]_p7962 was to be buried in the grave with [his]_p7961 father.

stoker_dracula," "" [Dr Seward]_n's886 [Diary]_n887. 20 September. , Only resolution and habit can let [me]_p7965 make an entry [to-night]_n888. [I]_p7966 am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that [I]_p7967 would not care if [I]_p7967 heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And [he]_p7969 has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late, Lucy's mother and [Arthur]_n's889 father, and now. Let [me]_p7970 get on with [my]_p7971 work. [I]_p7972 duly relieved [Van Helsing]_n890 in [his]_p7973 watch over [Lucy]_n891. [We]_p7974 wanted [Arthur]_n892 to go to [rest]_n893 also, but [he]_p7975 refused at first. [It]_p7976 was only when [I]_p7977 told [him]_p7978 that [we]_p7980 should want [him]_p7979 to help [us]_p7982 during the day, and that [we]_p7981 must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that [he]_p7983 agreed to go. [Van Helsing]_n894 was very kind to him.",9,,19,
stoker_dracula," ""Come, [my]_p7984 child,"" [he]_p7985 said  ""come with me. [You]_p7986 are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on [your]_p7987 strength that [we]_p7988 know of. [You]_p7989 must not be alone for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas. [You]_p7990 shall lie on one, and [I]_p7991 on the other, and [our]_p7992 sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though [we]_p7993 do not speak, and even if [we]_p7994 sleep. "" [Arthur]_n895 went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's face, which lay in [her]_p7995 pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. [She]_p7996 lay quite still, and [I]_p7997 looked round the room to see that all was as [it]_p7998 should be. [I]_p7999 could see that the [Professor]_n896 had carried out in this room, as in the other, [his]_p8000 purpose of using the garlic the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk handkerchief which [Van Helsing]_n897 made [her]_p8001 keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and [her]_p8002 face was at [its]_p8003 worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. [Her]_p8004 teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than [they]_p8005 had been in the morning.",3,,22,
stoker_dracula," In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the [rest]_n898. [I]_p8006 sat down by her, and presently [she]_p8007 moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. [I]_p8008 went over to [it]_p8009 softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight, and [I]_p8010 could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round, doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim, and every now and again struck the window with [its]_p8011 wings. When [I]_p8012 came back to [my]_p8014 seat, [I]_p8013 found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from [her]_p8015 throat. [I]_p8016 replaced [them]_p8018 as well as [I]_p8017 could, and sat watching her. Presently [she]_p8019 woke, and [I]_p8020 gave [her]_p8021 food, as [Van]_n899 Helsing had prescribed. [She]_p8022 took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with [her]_p8023 now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked [her]_p8024 illness.",2,,19,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p8025 struck [me]_p8026 as curious that the moment [she]_p8027 became conscious [she]_p8028 pressed the garlic flowers close to her. [It]_p8029 was certainly odd that whenever [she]_p8030 got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, [she]_p8031 put the flowers from [her]_p8034 but that when [she]_p8031 waked [she]_p8032 clutched [them]_p8035 close. There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, [she]_p8036 had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times. At six o'clock [Van Helsing]_n900 came to relieve me. [Arthur]_n901 had then fallen into a doze, and [he]_p8037 mercifully let [him]_p8038 sleep on. When [he]_p8039 saw Lucy's face [I]_p8042 could hear the sissing indraw of [his]_p8044 breath, and [he]_p8040 said to [me]_p8046 in a sharp whisper: ""Draw up the blind [I]_p8043 want light!"" Then [he]_p8040 bent down, and, with [his]_p8045 face almost touching Lucy's, examined [her]_p8047 carefully. [He]_p8048 removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from [her]_p8049 throat. As [he]_p8050 did so [he]_p8051 started back, and [I]_p8052 could hear [his]_p8053 ejaculation, ""[Mein Gott]_n!""902 as [it]_p8055 was smothered in [his]_p8054 throat. [I]_p8056 bent over and looked, too, and as [I]_p8057 noticed some queer chill came over me. The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.",3,,33,
stoker_dracula," For fully five minutes [Van Helsing]_n903 stood looking at her, with [his]_p8058 face at [its]_p8059 sternest. Then [he]_p8060 turned to [me]_p8061 and said calmly:,   ""She is dying. [It]_p8062 will not be long now. [It]_p8063 will be much difference, mark me, whether [she]_p8064 dies conscious or in [her]_p8065 sleep. Wake that [poor]_n904 boy, and let [him]_p8066 come and see the last [he]_p8068 trusts us, and [we]_p8069 have promised him. ""  [I]_p8070 went to the dining-room and waked him. [He]_p8071 was dazed for a moment, but when [he]_p8072 saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters [he]_p8073 thought [he]_p8073 was late, and expressed [his]_p8075 fear. [I]_p8076 assured [him]_p8079 that Lucy was still asleep, but told [him]_p8080 as gently as [I]_p8077 could that both [Van Helsing]_n905 and [I]_p8077 feared that the end was near. [He]_p8081 covered [his]_p8082 face with [his]_p8083 hands, and slid down on [his]_p8083 knees by the sofa, where [he]_p8087 remained, perhaps a minute, with [his]_p8084 head buried, praying, whilst [his]_p8084 shoulders shook with grief. [I]_p8088 took [him]_p8089 by the hand and raised [him]_p8090 up.",3,,32,
stoker_dracula," ""Come,"" [I]_p8091 said, ""my [dear]_n906 old fellow, summon all [your]_p8092 fortitude: [it]_p8093 will be best and easiest for her. "" When [we]_p8094 came into Lucy's room [I]_p8095 could see that [Van Helsing]_n907 had, with [his]_p8096 usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible. [He]_p8097 had even brushed Lucy's hair, so that [it]_p8098 lay on the pillow in [its]_p8099 usual sunny ripples. When [we]_p8100 came into the room [she]_p8101 opened [her]_p8102 eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly:, ""[Arthur]_n!908 Oh, [my]_p8106 love, [I]_p8107 am so glad [you]_p8108 have come!"" [He]_p8109 was stooping to kiss her, when [Van Helsing]_n909 motioned [him]_p8104 back. ""No,"" [he]_p8110 whispered, ""not yet! Hold [her]_p8111 hand [it]_p8113 will comfort [her]_p8112 more. "" So [Arthur]_n910 took [her]_p8114 hand and [knelt]_n911 beside her, and [she]_p8118 looked [her]_p8115 best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of [her]_p8115 eyes. Then gradually [her]_p8119 eyes closed, and [she]_p8120 sank to sleep. For a little bit [her]_p8121 breast heaved softly, and [her]_p8122 breath came and went like a tired child's. And then insensibly there came the strange change which [I]_p8123 had noticed in the night. [Her]_p8124 breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever.",6,,31,
stoker_dracula," In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way [she]_p8125 opened [her]_p8126 eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as [I]_p8130 had never heard from [her]_p8127 lips:, ""[Arthur]_n!912 Oh, [my]_p8133 love, [I]_p8131 am so glad [you]_p8134 have come! Kiss me!"" [Arthur]_n913 bent eagerly over to kiss [her]_p8127 but at that instant [[Van Helsing]_n]_n,914 who, like me, had been startled by [her]_p8128 voice, swooped upon him, and catching [him]_p8135 by the neck with both hands, dragged [him]_p8136 back with a fury of strength which [I]_p8131 never thought [he]_p8139 could have possessed, and actually hurled [him]_p8136 almost across the room. ""Not for [your]_p8140 life!"" [he]_p8142 said ""not for [your]_p8141 living soul and hers!"" And [he]_p8143 stood between [them]_p8144 like a lion at bay. [Arthur]_n915 was so taken aback that [he]_p8145 did not for a moment know what to do or say and before any impulse of violence could seize [him]_p8147 [he]_p8146 realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting. [I]_p8148 kept [my]_p8149 eyes fixed on [Lucy]_n,916 as did [Van Helsing]_n,917 and [we]_p8150 saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over [her]_p8151 face the sharp teeth champed together. Then [her]_p8152 eyes closed, and [she]_p8153 breathed heavily. Very shortly after [she]_p8154 opened [her]_p8156 eyes in all [their]_p8159 softness, and putting out [her]_p8157 poor, pale, thin hand, took [Van Helsing]_n's918 great brown one drawing [it]_p8160 to her, [she]_p8155 kissed it. ""My true friend,"" [she]_p8162 said, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, ""My true friend, and his! Oh, guard him, and give [me]_p8165 peace!""  ""I swear it!"" [he]_p8166 said solemnly, kneeling beside [her]_p8167 and holding up [his]_p8163 hand, as one who registers an oath. Then [he]_p8168 turned to Arthur, and said to him: ""Come, [my]_p8169 child, take [her]_p8170 hand in yours, and kiss [her]_p8171 on the forehead, and only once. ""  [Their]_p8172 eyes met instead of [their]_p8173 lips and so [they]_p8174 parted. Lucy's eyes closed and [Van Helsing]_n,919 who had been watching closely, took [Arthur]_n's920 arm, and drew [him]_p8175 away.",10,,47,
stoker_dracula," And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once [it]_p8176 ceased. ""It is all over,"" said [Van Helsing]_n921. ""She is dead!"" [I]_p8177 took [Arthur]_n922 by the arm, and led [him]_p8178 away to the drawing-room, where [he]_p8179 sat down, and covered [his]_p8180 face with [his]_p8181 hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke [me]_p8182 down to see. [I]_p8183 went back to the room, and found [Van Helsing]_n923 looking at poor Lucy, and [his]_p8184 face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over [her]_p8185 body. Death had given back part of [her]_p8186 beauty, for [her]_p8187 brow and cheeks had recovered some of [their]_p8188 flowing lines even the lips had lost [their]_p8189 deadly pallor. [It]_p8190 was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be. ""We thought [her]_p8191 dying whilst [she]_p8192 slept, And sleeping when [she]_p8193 died. "" [I]_p8194 stood beside [Van Helsing]_n,924 and said:, ""Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for [her]_p8195 at last. [It]_p8196 is the end!""  [He]_p8197 turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:,   ""Not so alas! not so.",4,,22,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p8198 is only the beginning!""  When [I]_p8199 asked [him]_p8200 what [he]_p8201 meant, [he]_p8202 only shook [his]_p8203 head and answered:,   ""We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see. "" CHAPTER XIII [DR]_n925. SEWARD'S [DIARY]_n,926 continued. The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that [Lucy]_n927 and [her]_p8204 mother might be buried together. [I]_p8205 attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that [his]_p8206 staff were afflicted, or blessed, with something of [his]_p8207 own obsequious suavity. Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when [she]_p8208 had come out from the death-chamber:,   ""She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege to attend on her. It's not too much to say that [she]_p8209 will do credit to [our]_p8210 establishment!"" [I]_p8211 noticed that [Van Helsing]_n928 never kept far away. This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household.",4,,14,
stoker_dracula," There were no relatives at hand and as [Arthur]_n929 had to be back the next day to attend at [his]_p8212 father's funeral, [we]_p8213 were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden. Under the circumstances, [Van Helsing]_n930 and [I]_p8214 took [it]_p8215 upon [ourselves]_p8216 to examine papers, etc. [He]_p8217 insisted upon looking over [Lucy]_n's931 papers himself. [I]_p8218 asked [him]_p8220 why, for [I]_p8219 feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of [English]_n932 legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. [He]_p8221 answered me:,   ""I know [I]_p8222 know. [You]_p8224 forget that [I]_p8225 am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But this is not altogether for the law. [You]_p8226 knew that, when [you]_p8227 avoided the coroner. [I]_p8228 have more than [him]_p8229 to avoid. There may be papers more, such as this.",4,,17,
stoker_dracula," ""  As [he]_p8230 spoke [he]_p8231 took from [his]_p8232 pocket-book the memorandum which had been in Lucy's breast, and which [she]_p8233 had torn in [her]_p8234 sleep. ""When [you]_p8235 find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs Westenra, seal all [her]_p8236 papers, and write [him]_p8237 [to-night]_n933. For me, [I]_p8238 watch here in the room and in [Miss Lucy]_n's934 old room all night, and [I]_p8239 [myself]_p8240 search for what may be. [It]_p8241 is not well that [her]_p8242 very thoughts go into the hands of strangers. ""  [I]_p8243 went on with [my]_p8244 part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs Westenra's solicitor and had written to him. All the poor lady's papers were in order explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given. [I]_p8245 had hardly sealed the letter, when, to [my]_p8249 surprise, [Van Helsing]_n935 walked into the room, saying:, ""Can [I]_p8246 help you, friend John? [I]_p8246 am free, and if [I]_p8247 may, [my]_p8250 service is to you. ""  ""Have [you]_p8251 got what [you]_p8252 looked for?"" [I]_p8253 asked, to which [he]_p8255 replied:,   ""I did not look for any specific thing. [I]_p8256 only hoped to find, and find [I]_p8257 have, all that there was, only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun. But [I]_p8258 have [them]_p8259 here, and [we]_p8261 shall for the present say nothing of them.",3,,30,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p8262 shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with [his]_p8264 sanction, [I]_p8263 shall use some. ""  When [we]_p8265 had finished the work in hand, [he]_p8267 said to me:,   ""And now, friend John, [I]_p8268 think [we]_p8266 may to bed. [We]_p8269 want sleep, both [you]_p8270 and I, and [rest]_n936 to recuperate. To-morrow [we]_p8271 shall have much to do, but for the [to-night]_n937 there is no need of us. Alas!""  Before turning in [we]_p8272 went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had certainly done [his]_p8273 work well, for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the winding-sheet was laid over the face when the [Professor]_n938 bent over and turned [it]_p8274 gently back, [we]_p8276 both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note [it]_p8275 well. All [Lucy]_n's939 loveliness had come back to [her]_p8277 in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of ""[decay]_n's940 effacing fingers,"" had but restored the beauty of life, till positively [I]_p8278 could not believe [my]_p8280 eyes that [I]_p8279 was looking at a corpse. The [Professor]_n941 looked sternly grave.",6,,19,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p8281 had not loved [her]_p8282 as [I]_p8283 had, and there was no need for tears in [his]_p8284 eyes. [He]_p8285 said to me: ""Remain till [I]_p8286 return,"" and left the room. [He]_p8287 came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then [he]_p8288 took from [his]_p8289 neck, inside [his]_p8290 collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed [it]_p8291 over the mouth. [He]_p8292 restored the sheet to [its]_p8293 place, and [we]_p8294 came away. [I]_p8295 was undressing in [my]_p8297 own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door, [he]_p8298 entered, and at once began to speak:,   ""To-morrow [I]_p8296 want [you]_p8299 to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem knives. ""  ""Must [we]_p8300 make an autopsy?"" [I]_p8301 asked. ""Yes and no. [I]_p8302 want to operate, but not as [you]_p8303 think. Let [me]_p8304 tell [you]_p8305 now, but not a word to another.",0,,25,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p8306 want to cut off [her]_p8307 head and take out [her]_p8308 heart. Ah! [you]_p8309 a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom [I]_p8310 have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder. Oh, but [I]_p8311 must not forget, [my]_p8314 [dear]_n942 friend John, that [you]_p8315 loved [her]_p8317 and [I]_p8312 have not forgotten it, for [it]_p8318 is [I]_p8312 that shall operate, and [you]_p8316 must only help. [I]_p8320 would like to do [it]_p8322 [to-night]_n,943 but for [Arthur]_n944 [I]_p8321 must not [he]_p8324 will be free after [his]_p8326 father's funeral to-morrow, and [he]_p8325 will want to see her, to see it. Then, when [she]_p8327 is coffined ready for the next day, [you]_p8328 and [I]_p8329 shall come when all sleep. [We]_p8330 shall unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do [our]_p8331 operation: and then replace all, so that none know, save [we]_p8332 alone. ""  ""But why do [it]_p8333 at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate [her]_p8334 poor body without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing to gain by it, no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge, why do it? Without such [it]_p8336 is monstrous. "" For answer [he]_p8339 put [his]_p8340 hand on [my]_p8341 shoulder, and said, with infinite tenderness:, ""[Friend John]_n,945 [I]_p8342 pity [your]_p8344 poor bleeding heart and [I]_p8343 love [you]_p8345 the more because [it]_p8346 does so bleed. If [I]_p8347 could, [I]_p8348 would take on [myself]_p8349 the burden that [you]_p8350 do bear.",4,,40,
stoker_dracula," But there are things that [you]_p8351 know not, but that [you]_p8352 shall know, and bless [me]_p8353 for knowing, though [they]_p8354 are not pleasant things. John, [my]_p8355 child, [you]_p8357 have been [my]_p8356 friend now many years, and yet did [you]_p8358 ever know [me]_p8359 to do any without good cause? [I]_p8360 may err, [I]_p8361 am but man but [I]_p8361 believe in all [I]_p8362 do. Was [it]_p8364 not for these causes that [you]_p8365 send for [me]_p8369 when the great trouble came? Yes! Were [you]_p8366 not amazed, nay horrified, when [I]_p8373 would not let [Arthur]_n946 kiss [his]_p8376 love, though [she]_p8377 was dying, and snatched [him]_p8381 away by all [my]_p8382 strength? Yes! And yet [you]_p8366 saw how [she]_p8378 thanked me, with [her]_p8384 so beautiful dying eyes, [her]_p8385 voice, too, so weak, and [she]_p8378 kiss [my]_p8383 rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did [you]_p8367 not hear [me]_p8370 swear promise to her, that so [she]_p8379 closed [her]_p8385 eyes grateful? Yes! ""Well, [I]_p8374 have good reason now for all [I]_p8374 want to do. [You]_p8388 have for many years trust [me]_p8389 [you]_p8391 have believe [me]_p8390 weeks past, when there be things so strange that [you]_p8392 might have well doubt. Believe [me]_p8393 yet a little, friend John. If [you]_p8394 trust [me]_p8395 not, then [I]_p8396 must tell what [I]_p8397 think and that is not perhaps well. And if [I]_p8398 work, as work [I]_p8399 shall, no matter trust or no trust, without [my]_p8402 friend trust in me, [I]_p8399 work with heavy heart and feel, oh! so lonely when [I]_p8400 want all help and courage that may be!"" [He]_p8403 paused a moment and went on solemnly: ""[Friend John]_n,947 there are strange and terrible days before us. Let [us]_p8404 not be two, but one, that so [we]_p8405 work to a good end. Will [you]_p8406 not have faith in me?""  [I]_p8407 took [his]_p8408 hand, and promised him. [I]_p8409 held [my]_p8410 door open as [he]_p8411 went away, and watched [him]_p8412 go into [his]_p8413 room and close the door.",2,,60,
stoker_dracula," As [I]_p8414 stood without moving, [I]_p8415 saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage, [she]_p8416 had [her]_p8417 back towards me, so did not see me, and go into the room where Lucy lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and [we]_p8418 are so grateful to those who show [it]_p8420 unasked to those [we]_p8419 love. Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which [she]_p8421 naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom [she]_p8422 loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest. * * * * * [I]_p8423 must have slept long and soundly, for [it]_p8424 was broad daylight when [Van Helsing]_n948 waked [me]_p8425 by coming into [my]_p8426 room. [He]_p8427 came over to [my]_p8428 bedside and said:,   ""You need not trouble about the knives [we]_p8429 shall not do it. ""  ""Why not?"" [I]_p8430 asked. For [his]_p8431 solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me. ""Because,"" [he]_p8432 said sternly, ""it is too late, or too early. See!"" Here [he]_p8433 held up the little golden crucifix.",1,,20,
stoker_dracula," ""This was stolen in the night. ""  ""How, stolen,"" [I]_p8434 asked in wonder, ""since [you]_p8436 have [it]_p8437 now?""  ""Because [I]_p8435 get [it]_p8438 back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the woman who robbed the dead and the living. [Her]_p8440 punishment will surely come, but not through [me]_p8441 [she]_p8442 knew not altogether what [she]_p8443 did and thus unknowing, [she]_p8443 only stole. Now [we]_p8445 must wait. ""  [He]_p8446 went away on the word, leaving [me]_p8447 with a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle to grapple with. The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr Marquand, of [Wholeman]_n,949 Sons, Marquand & [Lidderdale]_n950. [He]_p8448 was very genial and very appreciative of what [we]_p8449 had done, and took off [our]_p8450 hands all cares as to details. During lunch [he]_p8451 told [us]_p8453 that Mrs Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from [her]_p8455 heart, and had put [her]_p8456 affairs in absolute order [he]_p8452 informed [us]_p8454 that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to [Arthur]_n951 Holmwood. When [he]_p8457 had told [us]_p8459 so much [he]_p8458 went on:,   ""Frankly [we]_p8460 did [our]_p8461 best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave [her]_p8462 daughter either penniless or not so free as [she]_p8463 should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance. Indeed, [we]_p8464 pressed the matter so far that [we]_p8465 almost came into collision, for [she]_p8467 asked [us]_p8468 if [we]_p8465 were or were not prepared to carry out [her]_p8469 wishes.",3,,35,
stoker_dracula," Of course, [we]_p8470 had then no alternative but to accept. [We]_p8471 were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred [we]_p8472 should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of [our]_p8473 judgment. Frankly, however, [I]_p8474 must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of [her]_p8475 wishes. For by [her]_p8476 predeceasing [her]_p8477 daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had [she]_p8481 only survived [her]_p8477 mother by five minutes, [her]_p8478 property would, in case there were no will, and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case, have been treated at [her]_p8478 decease as under intestacy. In which case [Lord]_n952 [Godalming]_n,953 though so [dear]_n954 a friend, would have had no claim in the world and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon [their]_p8482 just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. [I]_p8483 assure you, [my]_p8485 [dear]_n955 sirs, [I]_p8484 am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced. ""  [He]_p8486 was a good fellow, but [his]_p8487 rejoicing at the one little part, in which [he]_p8488 was officially interested, of so great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding. [He]_p8489 did not remain long, but said [he]_p8490 would look in later in the day and see [Lord Godalming]_n956. [His]_p8491 coming, however, had been a certain comfort to us, since [it]_p8494 assured [us]_p8492 that [we]_p8495 should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of [our]_p8496 acts. [Arthur]_n957 was expected at five o'clock, so a little before that time [we]_p8497 visited the death-chamber.",6,,27,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p8498 was so in very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker, true to [his]_p8499 craft, had made the best display [he]_p8501 could of [his]_p8500 goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered [our]_p8502 spirits at once. [Van Helsing]_n958 ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to, explaining that, as [Lord]_n959 [Godalming]_n960 was coming very soon, [it]_p8503 would be less harrowing to [his]_p8504 feelings to see all that was left of [his]_p8505 fianc e quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at [his]_p8506 own stupidity and exerted [himself]_p8508 to restore things to the condition in which [we]_p8509 left [them]_p8511 the night before, so that when [Arthur]_n961 came such shocks to [his]_p8507 feelings as [we]_p8510 could avoid were saved. [Poor]_n962 fellow! [He]_p8512 looked desperately sad and broken even [his]_p8513 stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of [his]_p8514 much-tried emotions. [He]_p8515 had, [I]_p8516 knew, been very genuinely and devotedly attached to [his]_p8517 father and to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him. With [me]_p8518 [he]_p8519 was warm as ever, and to [Van Helsing]_n963 [he]_p8520 was sweetly courteous but [I]_p8521 could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him. The [Professor]_n964 noticed it, too, and motioned [me]_p8522 to bring [him]_p8523 upstairs. [I]_p8524 did so, and left [him]_p8526 at the door of the room, as [I]_p8525 felt [he]_p8527 would like to be quite alone with her, but [he]_p8528 took [my]_p8532 arm and led [me]_p8533 in, saying huskily:,   ""You loved [her]_p8529 too, old fellow [she]_p8535 told [me]_p8534 all about it, and there was no friend had a closer place in [her]_p8530 heart than you. [I]_p8536 don't know how to thank [you]_p8537 for all [you]_p8538 have done for her.",7,,40,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p8539 can't think yet. "" Here [he]_p8540 suddenly broke down, and threw [his]_p8541 arms round [my]_p8543 shoulders and laid [his]_p8542 head on [my]_p8544 breast, crying:, ""Oh, [Jack]_n!965 [Jack]_n!966 What shall [I]_p8545 do! The whole of life seems gone from [me]_p8546 all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for [me]_p8547 to live for. ""  [I]_p8548 comforted [him]_p8550 as well as [I]_p8549 could. In such cases men do not need much expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy [dear]_n967 to a man's heart. [I]_p8551 stood still and silent till [his]_p8553 sobs died away, and then [I]_p8552 said softly to him:,   ""Come and look at her. ""  Together [we]_p8554 moved over to the bed, and [I]_p8555 lifted the lawn from [her]_p8556 face. God! how beautiful [she]_p8557 was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing [her]_p8558 loveliness. [It]_p8559 frightened and amazed [me]_p8560 somewhat and as for [Arthur]_n,968 [he]_p8561 fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague.",4,,23,
stoker_dracula," At last, after a long pause, [he]_p8562 said to [me]_p8563 in a faint whisper:, ""[Jack]_n,969 is [she]_p8564 really dead?"" [I]_p8565 assured [him]_p8568 sadly that [it]_p8569 was so, and went on to suggest, for [I]_p8566 felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than [I]_p8566 could help, that [it]_p8570 often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into [their]_p8571 youthful beauty that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering. [It]_p8572 seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at [her]_p8573 lovingly and long, [he]_p8574 turned aside. [I]_p8575 told [him]_p8576 that that must be good-bye, as the coffin had to be prepared so [he]_p8577 went back and took [her]_p8578 dead hand in [his]_p8580 and kissed it, and bent over and kissed [her]_p8579 forehead. [He]_p8581 came away, fondly looking back over [his]_p8582 shoulder at [her]_p8583 as [he]_p8584 came. [I]_p8585 left [him]_p8586 in the drawing-room, and told [Van Helsing]_n970 that [he]_p8587 had said good-bye so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When [he]_p8588 came out of the room again [I]_p8590 told [him]_p8592 of [Arthur]_n's971 question, and [he]_p8589 replied:, ""I am not surprised. Just now [I]_p8593 doubted for a moment myself!""  [We]_p8595 all dined together, and [I]_p8594 could see that poor Art was trying to make the best of things. [Van Helsing]_n972 had been silent all dinner-time but when [we]_p8596 had lit [our]_p8597 cigars [he]_p8598 said, ""[Lord]_n,973 , "" but [Arthur]_n974 interrupted him:, ""No, no, not that, for God's sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir: [I]_p8599 did not mean to speak offensively [it]_p8600 is only because [my]_p8601 loss is so recent. "" The [Professor]_n975 answered very sweetly:, ""I only used that name because [I]_p8602 was in doubt.",7,,40,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p8604 must not call [you]_p8606 'Mr,' and [I]_p8605 have grown to love you, yes, [my]_p8609 [dear]_n976 boy, to love you, as [Arthur]_n977. "" [Arthur]_n978 held out [his]_p8610 hand, and took the old man's warmly. ""Call [me]_p8611 what [you]_p8612 will,"" [he]_p8613 said. ""I hope [I]_p8614 may always have the title of a friend. And let [me]_p8616 say that [I]_p8617 am at a loss for words to thank [you]_p8618 for [your]_p8619 goodness to [my]_p8620 poor [dear]_n979. "" [He]_p8621 paused a moment, and went on: ""I know that [she]_p8625 understood [your]_p8626 goodness even better than [I]_p8622 do and if [I]_p8623 was rude or in any way wanting at that time [you]_p8627 acted so, [you]_p8628 remember"", the [Professor]_n980 nodded, ""you must forgive me. ""  [He]_p8630 answered with a grave kindness:,   ""I know [it]_p8633 was hard for [you]_p8635 to quite trust [me]_p8639 then, for to trust such violence needs to understand and [I]_p8631 take [it]_p8634 that [you]_p8636 do not, that [you]_p8636 cannot, trust [me]_p8640 now, for [you]_p8637 do not yet understand. And there may be more times when [I]_p8641 shall want [you]_p8642 to trust when [you]_p8643 cannot, and may not, and must not yet understand. But the time will come when [your]_p8644 trust shall be whole and complete in me, and when [you]_p8645 shall understand as though the sunlight [himself]_p8646 shone through. Then [you]_p8647 shall bless [me]_p8648 from first to last for [your]_p8649 own sake, and for the sake of others and for [her]_p8650 [dear]_n981 sake to whom [I]_p8651 swore to protect.",6,,42,
stoker_dracula," "" ""And, indeed, indeed, sir,"" said [Arthur]_n982 warmly, ""I shall in all ways trust you. [I]_p8652 know and believe [you]_p8653 have a very noble heart, and [you]_p8654 are [Jack]_n's983 friend, and [you]_p8654 were hers. [You]_p8656 shall do what [you]_p8657 like. "" The [Professor]_n984 cleared [his]_p8658 throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said:, ""May [I]_p8659 ask [you]_p8660 something now?"" ""Certainly. "" ""You know that Mrs Westenra left [you]_p8661 all [her]_p8662 property?"" ""No, poor [dear]_n985 [I]_p8663 never thought of it. ""  ""And as [it]_p8664 is all yours, [you]_p8666 have a right to deal with [it]_p8665 as [you]_p8667 will. [I]_p8668 want [you]_p8669 to give [me]_p8670 permission to read all [Miss Lucy]_n's986 papers and letters. Believe me, [it]_p8671 is no idle curiosity. [I]_p8672 have a motive of which, be sure, [she]_p8673 would have approved. [I]_p8674 have [them]_p8675 all here.",5,,24,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p8676 took [them]_p8677 before [we]_p8679 knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch them, no strange eye look through words into [her]_p8680 soul. [I]_p8681 shall keep them, if [I]_p8682 may even [you]_p8687 may not see [them]_p8684 yet, but [I]_p8682 shall keep [them]_p8685 safe.

[Arthur]_n988 spoke out heartily, like [his]_p8695 old self:, ""Dr [Van Helsing]_n,989 [you]_p8692 may do what [you]_p8693 will. [I]_p8696 feel that in saying this [I]_p8697 am doing what [my]_p8698 [dear]_n990 one would have approved. [I]_p8699 shall not trouble [you]_p8700 with questions till the time comes. "" The old [Professor]_n991 stood up as [he]_p8701 said solemnly:, ""And [you]_p8702 are right. There will be pain for [us]_p8703 all but [it]_p8704 will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last. [We]_p8705 and [you]_p8706 too, [you]_p8707 most of all, [my]_p8708 [dear]_n992 boy, will have to pass through the bitter water before [we]_p8709 reach the sweet. But [we]_p8710 must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do [our]_p8711 duty, and all will be well!"" [I]_p8712 slept on a sofa in [Arthur]_n's993 room that night.",7,,35,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n994 did not go to bed at all. [He]_p8713 went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in [her]_p8714 coffin, strewn with the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night. Mina Harker's [Journal]_n995. 22 September. , In the train to [Exeter]_n996. [Jonathan]_n997 sleeping. [It]_p8715 seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and no news of [him]_p8716 and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, master of [his]_p8718 business, Mr Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day [he]_p8719 may ask [me]_p8720 about it. Down [it]_p8721 all goes. [I]_p8722 am rusty in [my]_p8723 shorthand, see what unexpected prosperity does for us, so [it]_p8724 may be as well to freshen [it]_p8725 up again with an exercise anyhow.",4,,12,
stoker_dracula," The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only [ourselves]_p8726 and the servants there, one or two old friends of [his]_p8727 from [Exeter]_n,998 [his]_p8728 London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and [I]_p8729 stood hand in hand, and [we]_p8730 felt that [our]_p8731 best and dearest friend was gone from us. [We]_p8732 came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan thought [it]_p8733 would interest [me]_p8735 to go into the Row for a while, so [we]_p8736 sat down but there were very few people there, and [it]_p8734 was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. [It]_p8737 made [us]_p8738 think of the empty chair at home so [we]_p8739 got up and walked down [Piccadilly]_n999. Jonathan was holding [me]_p8740 by the arm, the way [he]_p8741 used to in old days before [I]_p8742 went to school. [I]_p8743 felt [it]_p8744 very improper, for [you]_p8747 can't go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of [it]_p8745 biting into [yourself]_p8748 a bit but [it]_p8745 was Jonathan, and [he]_p8749 was [my]_p8750 husband, and [we]_p8751 didn't know anybody who saw us, and [we]_p8752 didn't care if [they]_p8754 did, so on [we]_p8752 walked. [I]_p8755 was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's, when [I]_p8756 felt Jonathan clutch [my]_p8760 arm so tight that [he]_p8761 hurt me, and [he]_p8762 said under [his]_p8763 breath: ""My God!"" [I]_p8756 am always anxious about Jonathan, for [I]_p8757 fear that some nervous fit may upset [him]_p8764 again so [I]_p8757 turned to [him]_p8765 quickly, and asked [him]_p8765 what [it]_p8768 was that disturbed him. [He]_p8769 was very pale, and [his]_p8770 eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, [he]_p8771 gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl.",2,,45,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p8772 was looking at [her]_p8773 so hard that [he]_p8774 did not see either of us, and so [I]_p8775 had a good view of him. [His]_p8776 face was not a good face [it]_p8777 was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and [his]_p8778 big white teeth, that looked all the whiter because [his]_p8779 lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's. [Jonathan]_n1000 kept staring at him, till [I]_p8780 was afraid [he]_p8781 would notice. [I]_p8782 feared [he]_p8783 might take [it]_p8785 ill, [he]_p8784 looked so fierce and nasty. [I]_p8786 asked Jonathan why [he]_p8791 was disturbed, and [he]_p8792 answered, evidently thinking that [I]_p8787 knew as much about [it]_p8798 as [he]_p8792 did: ""Do [you]_p8803 see who [it]_p8799 is?"" ""No, [dear]_n,""1001 [I]_p8787 said ""I don't know [him]_p8804 who is it?"" [His]_p8806 answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for [it]_p8799 was said as if [he]_p8793 did not know that [it]_p8800 was to me, Mina, to whom [he]_p8793 was speaking:, ""It is the man himself!"" The poor [dear]_n1002 was evidently terrified at something, very greatly terrified [I]_p8788 do believe that if [he]_p8793 had not had [me]_p8807 to lean on and to support [him]_p8805 [he]_p8794 would have sunk down. [He]_p8810 kept staring a man came out of the shop with a small parcel, and gave [it]_p8811 to the lady, who then drove off. The dark man kept [his]_p8812 eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage moved up [Piccadilly]_n1003 [he]_p8813 followed in the same direction, and hailed a hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:, ""I believe [it]_p8814 is the Count, but [he]_p8815 has grown [young]_n1004. [My]_p8816 God, if this be so! Oh, [my]_p8817 God! [my]_p8818 God! If [I]_p8819 only knew! if [I]_p8820 only knew!"" [He]_p8823 was distressing [himself]_p8824 so much that [I]_p8820 feared to keep [his]_p8825 mind on the subject by asking [him]_p8826 any questions, so [I]_p8821 remained silent. [I]_p8827 drew [him]_p8828 away quietly, and he, holding [my]_p8829 arm, came easily.",5,,54,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p8830 walked a little further, and then went in and sat for a while in the [Green Park]_n1005. [It]_p8831 was a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place. After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and [he]_p8832 went quietly into a sleep, with [his]_p8833 head on [my]_p8834 shoulder. [I]_p8835 thought [it]_p8836 was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty minutes [he]_p8837 woke up, and said to [me]_p8838 quite cheerfully:,   ""Why, Mina, have [I]_p8840 been asleep! Oh, do forgive [me]_p8839 for being so rude. Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere. "" [He]_p8841 had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger, as in [his]_p8842 illness [he]_p8843 had forgotten all that this episode had reminded [him]_p8844 of. [I]_p8845 don't like this lapsing into forgetfulness [it]_p8846 may make or continue some injury to the brain. [I]_p8847 must not ask him, for fear [I]_p8848 shall do more harm than good but [I]_p8848 must somehow learn the facts of [his]_p8850 journey abroad. The time is come, [I]_p8851 fear, when [I]_p8852 must open that parcel, and know what is written.",1,,23,
stoker_dracula," Oh, Jonathan, [you]_p8853 will, [I]_p8854 know, forgive [me]_p8856 if [I]_p8855 do wrong, but [it]_p8857 is for [your]_p8858 own [dear]_n1006 sake. * * * * *  Later. , A sad home-coming in every way, the house empty of the [dear]_n1007 soul who was so good to [us]_p8859 Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of [his]_p8860 malady and now a telegram from [Van Helsing]_n,1008 whoever [he]_p8861 may be:, ""You will be grieved to hear that Mrs Westenra died five days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday. [They]_p8862 were both buried [to-day]_n1009. "" Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! [Poor]_n1010 Mrs Westenra! poor Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor [Arthur]_n,1011 to have lost such sweetness out of [his]_p8865 life! God help [us]_p8863 all to bear [our]_p8866 troubles.

[Van Helsing]_n1019 is lying down, having a [rest]_n1020 preparatory to [his]_p8876 journey. [He]_p8877 goes over to Amsterdam [to-night]_n,1021 but says [he]_p8878 returns to-morrow night that [he]_p8879 only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally. [He]_p8880 is to stop with [me]_p8881 then, if [he]_p8882 can [he]_p8883 says [he]_p8883 has work to do in London which may take [him]_p8885 some time. [Poor]_n1022 old fellow! [I]_p8886 fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even [his]_p8887 iron strength. All the time of the burial [he]_p8888 was, [I]_p8889 could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself. When [it]_p8890 was all over, [we]_p8891 were standing beside [Arthur]_n,1023 who, poor fellow, was speaking of [his]_p8892 part in the operation where [his]_p8893 blood had been transfused to [his]_p8893 Lucy's veins [I]_p8895 could see [Van Helsing]_n's1024 face grow white and purple by turns. [Arthur]_n1025 was saying that [he]_p8896 felt since then as if [they]_p8897 two had been really married and that [she]_p8898 was [his]_p8899 wife in the sight of God. None of [us]_p8900 said a word of the other operations, and none of [us]_p8901 ever shall. [Arthur]_n1026 and [Quincey]_n1027 went away together to the station, and [Van Helsing]_n1028 and [I]_p8902 came on here.",11,,28,
stoker_dracula," The moment [we]_p8903 were alone in the carriage [he]_p8904 gave way to a regular fit of hysterics. [He]_p8905 has denied to [me]_p8906 since that [it]_p8907 was hysterics, and insisted that [it]_p8908 was only [his]_p8909 sense of humour asserting [itself]_p8910 under very terrible conditions. [He]_p8911 laughed till [he]_p8912 cried, and [I]_p8915 had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see [us]_p8916 and misjudge and then [he]_p8913 cried, till [he]_p8913 laughed again and laughed and cried together, just as a woman does. [I]_p8917 tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circumstances but [it]_p8918 had no effect. Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when [his]_p8919 face grew grave and stern again [I]_p8921 asked [him]_p8922 why [his]_p8920 mirth, and why at such a time. [His]_p8923 reply was in a way characteristic of him, for [it]_p8924 was logical and forceful and mysterious. [He]_p8925 said:,   ""Ah, [you]_p8926 don't comprehend, friend John. Do not think that [I]_p8927 am not sad, though [I]_p8928 laugh. See, [I]_p8929 have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But no more think that [I]_p8930 am all sorry when [I]_p8931 cry, for the laugh [he]_p8932 come just the same.",0,,30,
stoker_dracula," Keep [it]_p8933 always with [you]_p8934 that laughter who knock at [your]_p8935 door and say, 'May [I]_p8936 come in?' is not the true laughter. No!

And yet [I]_p8955 can laugh at [her]_p8956 very grave, laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon [her]_p8957 coffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to [my]_p8958 heart, till [it]_p8960 send back the blood from [my]_p8959 cheek.

stoker_dracula," Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as [they]_p8986 fall, all dance together to the music that [he]_p8987 make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that [he]_p8988 is good to come, and kind. Ah, [we]_p8989 men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull [us]_p8990 different ways. Then tears come and, like the rain on the ropes, [they]_p8991 brace [us]_p8992 up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and [we]_p8993 break. But [King Laugh]_n1033 [he]_p8994 come like the sunshine, and [he]_p8995 ease off the strain again and [we]_p8996 bear to go on with [our]_p8997 labour, what [it]_p8998 may be. ""  [I]_p8999 did not like to wound [him]_p9002 by pretending not to see [his]_p9004 idea but, as [I]_p9000 did not yet understand the cause of [his]_p9005 laughter, [I]_p9000 asked him. As [he]_p9006 answered [me]_p9008 [his]_p9009 face grew stern, and [he]_p9007 said in quite a different tone:,   ""Oh, [it]_p9010 was the grim irony of [it]_p9011 all, this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one [we]_p9012 wondered if [she]_p9013 were truly dead [she]_p9014 laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard, where rest so many of [her]_p9016 kin, laid there with the mother who loved her, and whom [she]_p9014 loved and that sacred bell going 'Toll! toll! toll!' so sad and slow and those holy men, with the white garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time [their]_p9018 eyes never on the page and all of [us]_p9019 with the bowed head.

"" ""The [Westminster Gazette]_n,""1040 25 September. A [HAMPSTEAD]_n1041 MYSTERY. The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as ""The [Kensington]_n1042 Horror,"" or ""The Stabbing Woman,"" or ""The Woman in Black. "" During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of [young]_n1043 children straying from home or neglecting to return from [their]_p9075 playing on the Heath. In all these cases the children were too [young]_n1044 to give any properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of [their]_p9076 excuses is that [they]_p9077 had been with a ""bloofer lady. "" [It]_p9078 has always been late in the evening when [they]_p9079 have been missed, and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning.",7,,19,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p9080 is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed gave as [his]_p9081 reason for being away that a ""bloofer lady"" had asked [him]_p9082 to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used [it]_p9083 as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A correspondent writes [us]_p9084 that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the ""bloofer lady"" is supremely funny. Some of [our]_p9085 caricaturists might, [he]_p9086 says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture. [It]_p9087 is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the ""bloofer lady"" should be the popular r le at these al fresco performances. [Our]_p9088 correspondent na vely says that even [Ellen Terry]_n1045 could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little children pretend, and even imagine themselves, to be. There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts [them]_p9089 has a system or method of [its]_p9090 own. The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially when very [young]_n,1046 in and around [Hampstead Heath]_n,1047 and for any stray dog which may be about.

[She]_p9722 showed [me]_p9723 in the doctor's letter that all [I]_p9724 wrote down was true. [It]_p9725 seems to have made a new man of me.

But, now that [I]_p9729 know, [I]_p9730 am not afraid, even of the Count.

[Van]_n1136 Helsing is the man to unmask [him]_p9737 and hunt [him]_p9738 out, if [he]_p9739 is anything like what Mina says. [We]_p9740 sat late, and talked [it]_p9741 all over.

Not knowing what to trust, [I]_p9765 did not know what to do and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of [my]_p9766 life. The groove ceased to avail me, and [I]_p9767 mistrusted myself. Doctor, [you]_p9768 don't know what [it]_p9769 is to doubt everything, even yourself.

""  ""We shall both come when [you]_p9838 will,"" [I]_p9839 said. [I]_p9840 had got [him]_p9841 the morning papers and the London papers of the previous night, and while [we]_p9842 were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the train to start, [he]_p9843 was turning [them]_p9844 over.",2,,32,
stoker_dracula," [His]_p9845 eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them, ""The [Westminster Gazette]_n"",1143 [I]_p9846 knew [it]_p9847 by the colour, and [he]_p9848 grew quite white. [He]_p9849 read something intently, groaning to himself: ""Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!"" [I]_p9850 do not think [he]_p9851 remembered [me]_p9852 at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and the train moved off. This recalled [him]_p9853 to himself, and [he]_p9854 leaned out of the window and waved [his]_p9855 hand, calling out: ""Love to [Madam Mina]_n1144 [I]_p9856 shall write so soon as ever [I]_p9857 can.

Until this afternoon [I]_p9860 had no cause to think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as [he]_p9861 ever was.",5,,17,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p9862 was already well ahead with [his]_p9863 fly business and [he]_p9864 had just started in the spider line also so [he]_p9865 had not been of any trouble to me. [I]_p9866 had a letter from [Arthur]_n,1148 written on Sunday, and from [it]_p9868 [I]_p9867 gather that [he]_p9869 is bearing up wonderfully well. [Quincey]_n1149 Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for [he]_p9870 [himself]_p9871 is a bubbling well of good spirits. [Quincey]_n1150 wrote [me]_p9872 a line too, and from [him]_p9873 [I]_p9874 hear that [Arthur]_n1151 is beginning to recover something of [his]_p9875 old buoyancy so as to [them]_p9876 all [my]_p9877 mind is at [rest]_n1152. As for myself, [I]_p9878 was settling down to [my]_p9881 work with the enthusiasm which [I]_p9879 used to have for it, so that [I]_p9879 might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on [me]_p9882 was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened and what is to be the end God only knows. [I]_p9883 have an idea that [Van Helsing]_n1153 thinks [he]_p9884 knows, too, but [he]_p9885 will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. [He]_p9886 went to [Exeter]_n1154 yesterday, and stayed there all night. [To-day]_n1155 [he]_p9887 came back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock, and thrust last night's ""[Westminster Gazette]_n""1156 into [my]_p9888 hand. ""What do [you]_p9889 think of that?"" [he]_p9890 asked as [he]_p9891 stood back and folded [his]_p9892 arms.",9,,31,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p9893 looked over the paper, for [I]_p9894 really did not know what [he]_p9895 meant but [he]_p9896 took [it]_p9897 from [me]_p9898 and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at [Hampstead]_n1157. [It]_p9899 did not convey much to me, until [I]_p9900 reached a passage where [it]_p9901 described small punctured wounds on [their]_p9902 throats. An idea struck me, and [I]_p9903 looked up. ""Well?"" [he]_p9904 said. ""It is like [poor Lucy]_n's1158. ""  ""And what do [you]_p9905 make of it?""  ""Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever [it]_p9906 was that injured [her]_p9907 has injured them. "" [I]_p9908 did not quite understand [his]_p9909 answer:,   ""That is true indirectly, but not directly. "" ""How do [you]_p9910 mean, [Professor]_n?""1159 [I]_p9911 asked. [I]_p9912 was a little inclined to take [his]_p9914 seriousness lightly, for, after all, four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits, but when [I]_p9913 saw [his]_p9915 face, [it]_p9916 sobered me.",3,,24,
stoker_dracula," Never, even in the midst of [our]_p9917 despair about poor Lucy, had [he]_p9918 looked more stern. ""Tell me!"" [I]_p9919 said. ""I can hazard no opinion. [I]_p9920 do not know what to think, and [I]_p9921 have no data on which to found a conjecture. ""  ""Do [you]_p9922 mean to tell me, friend John, that [you]_p9923 have no suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of not after all the hints given, not only by events, but by me?""  ""Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood. ""  ""And how the blood lost or waste?"" [I]_p9924 shook [my]_p9925 head. [He]_p9926 stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on:,   ""You are clever man, friend John [you]_p9927 reason well, and [your]_p9929 wit is bold  but [you]_p9928 are too prejudiced.

Do [you]_p9934 not think that there are things which [you]_p9935 cannot understand, and yet which are that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men's eyes, because [they]_p9936 know, or think [they]_p9937 know, some things which other men have told them. Ah, [it]_p9938 is the fault of [our]_p9942 science that [it]_p9939 wants to explain all and if [it]_p9939 explain not, then [it]_p9940 says there is nothing to explain.",0,,26,

[I]_p9946 suppose now [you]_p9947 do not believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in hypnotism, , ""  ""Yes,"" [I]_p9948 said. ""Charcot has proved that pretty well. "" [He]_p9949 smiled as [he]_p9950 went on: ""Then [you]_p9951 are satisfied as to it. Yes?

No? Then, friend John, am [I]_p9956 to take [it]_p9958 that [you]_p9959 simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank? No?

There are always mysteries in life. Why was [it]_p9964 that Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men's blood in [her]_p9965 poor veins, could not live even one day?

Can [you]_p9971 tell [me]_p9974 why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry [their]_p9976 veins how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that [it]_p9977 is hot, flit down on them, and then, and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?"" ""Good God, [Professor]_n!""1161 [I]_p9978 said, starting up. ""Do [you]_p9979 mean to tell [me]_p9982 that Lucy was bitten by such a bat and that such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century?"" [He]_p9985 waved [his]_p9986 hand for silence, and went on:,   ""Can [you]_p9980 tell [me]_p9983 why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men why the elephant goes on and on till [he]_p9987 have seen dynasties and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?

[I]_p10002 had a dim idea that [he]_p10004 was teaching [me]_p10007 some lesson, as long ago [he]_p10005 used to do in [his]_p10009 study at Amsterdam but [he]_p10005 used then to tell [me]_p10008 the thing, so that [I]_p10003 could have the object of thought in mind all the time. But now [I]_p10010 was without this help, yet [I]_p10011 wanted to follow him, so [I]_p10011 said:, ""[Professor]_n,1162 let [me]_p10013 be [your]_p10014 pet student again.

[He]_p10098 went on:,   ""My friend, [it]_p10099 was because [I]_p10100 wished to be gentle in the breaking to you, for [I]_p10101 know [you]_p10102 have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet [I]_p10104 do not expect [you]_p10105 to believe.",7,,43,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p10106 is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that [we]_p10107 may doubt such to be possible when [we]_p10108 have always believed the 'no' of [it]_p10109 [it]_p10110 is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. [To-night]_n1171 [I]_p10111 go to prove it. Dare [you]_p10112 come with me?""  This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth Byron excepted from the category, jealousy. ""And prove the very truth [he]_p10113 most abhorred. ""  [He]_p10114 saw [my]_p10115 hesitation, and spoke:,   ""The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog. If [it]_p10116 be not true, then proof will be relief  at worst [it]_p10117 will not harm. If [it]_p10118 be true! Ah, there is the dread yet very dread should help [my]_p10120 cause, for in [it]_p10119 is some need of belief. Come, [I]_p10121 tell [you]_p10123 what [I]_p10122 propose: first, that [we]_p10124 go off now and see that child in the hospital. Dr Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and [I]_p10125 think of [yours]_p10126 since [you]_p10127 were in class at Amsterdam.",1,,22,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p10128 will let two scientists see [his]_p10129 case, if [he]_p10130 will not let two friends. [We]_p10131 shall tell [him]_p10132 nothing, but only that [we]_p10133 wish to learn. And then, , ""  ""And then?"" [He]_p10134 took a key from [his]_p10135 pocket and held [it]_p10136 up. ""And then [we]_p10137 spend the night, [you]_p10138 and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is the key that lock the tomb. [I]_p10139 had [it]_p10140 from the coffin-man to give to [Arthur]_n1172. "" [My]_p10141 heart sank within me, for [I]_p10142 felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us. [I]_p10143 could do nothing, however, so [I]_p10144 plucked up what heart [I]_p10144 could and said that [we]_p10146 had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing. [We]_p10147 found the child awake. [It]_p10148 had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well.",1,,21,
stoker_dracula," Dr Vincent took the bandage from [its]_p10149 throat, and showed [us]_p10150 the punctures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. [They]_p10151 were smaller, and the edges looked fresher that was all. [We]_p10152 asked Vincent to what [he]_p10153 attributed them, and [he]_p10154 replied that [it]_p10156 must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat but, for [his]_p10158 own part, [he]_p10154 was inclined to think that [it]_p10157 was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London. ""Out of so many harmless ones,"" [he]_p10159 said, ""there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and [it]_p10160 managed to escape or even from the Zo logical Gardens a [young]_n1173 one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, [you]_p10161 know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, [I]_p10162 believe, traced up in this direction. For a week after, the children were playing nothing but [Red]_n1174 Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare came along, since when [it]_p10163 has been quite a gala-time with them. Even this poor little mite, when [he]_p10164 woke up to-day, asked the nurse if [he]_p10165 might go away.",2,,17,
stoker_dracula," When [she]_p10166 asked [him]_p10167 why [he]_p10168 wanted to go, [he]_p10169 said [he]_p10169 wanted to play with the 'bloofer lady. '"" ""I hope,"" said [Van Helsing]_n,1175 ""that when [you]_p10171 are sending the child home [you]_p10172 will caution [its]_p10173 parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies to stray are most dangerous and if the child were to remain out another night, [it]_p10174 would probably be fatal. But in any case [I]_p10175 suppose [you]_p10176 will not let [it]_p10177 away for some days?""  ""Certainly not, not for a week at least longer if the wound is not healed. ""  [Our]_p10178 visit to the hospital took more time than [we]_p10179 had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before [we]_p10180 came out. When [Van Helsing]_n1176 saw how dark [it]_p10181 was, [he]_p10182 said:, ""There is no hurry. [It]_p10183 is more late than [I]_p10184 thought. Come, let [us]_p10185 seek somewhere that [we]_p10186 may eat, and then [we]_p10187 shall go on [our]_p10188 way. ""  [We]_p10189 dined at ""Jack Straw's Castle"" along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock [we]_p10190 started from the inn.",2,,25,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p10191 was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when [we]_p10192 were once outside [their]_p10193 individual radius. The [Professor]_n1177 had evidently noted the road [we]_p10194 were to go, for [he]_p10195 went on unhesitatingly but, as for me, [I]_p10196 was in quite a mixup as to locality. As [we]_p10197 went further, [we]_p10198 met fewer and fewer people, till at last [we]_p10198 were somewhat surprised when [we]_p10199 met even the patrol of horse police going [their]_p10201 usual suburban round. At last [we]_p10202 reached the wall of the churchyard, which [we]_p10203 climbed over. With some little difficulty, for [it]_p10204 was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us, [we]_p10205 found the Westenra tomb. The [Professor]_n1178 took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned [me]_p10206 to precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. [My]_p10207 companion followed [me]_p10208 quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one. In the latter case [we]_p10209 should have been in a bad plight. Then [he]_p10210 fumbled in [his]_p10211 bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light.",2,,21,
stoker_dracula," The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, [their]_p10212 whites turning to rust and [their]_p10213 greens to browns when the spider and the beetle had resumed [their]_p10213 accustomed dominance when time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined. [It]_p10215 conveyed irresistibly the idea that life, animal life, was not the only thing which could pass away. [Van Helsing]_n1179 went about [his]_p10216 work systematically. Holding [his]_p10217 candle so that [he]_p10218 could read the coffin plates, and so holding [it]_p10220 that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as [they]_p10221 touched the metal, [he]_p10219 made assurance of [Lucy]_n's1180 coffin. Another search in [his]_p10222 bag, and [he]_p10223 took out a turnscrew. ""What are [you]_p10224 going to do?"" [I]_p10225 asked. ""To open the coffin. [You]_p10226 shall yet be convinced. "" Straightway [he]_p10227 began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me.",2,,16,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p10228 seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as [it]_p10229 would have been to have stripped off [her]_p10230 clothing in [her]_p10231 sleep whilst living [I]_p10232 actually took hold of [his]_p10233 hand to stop him. [He]_p10234 only said: ""You shall see,"" and again fumbling in [his]_p10235 bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made [me]_p10236 wince, [he]_p10237 made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw. [I]_p10238 had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. [We]_p10239 doctors, who have had to study [our]_p10240 dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and [I]_p10241 drew back towards the door. But the [Professor]_n1181 never stopped for a moment [he]_p10242 sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the edge of the loose flange, [he]_p10243 bent [it]_p10244 back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to [me]_p10245 to look. [I]_p10246 drew near and looked. The coffin was empty. [It]_p10247 was certainly a surprise to me, and gave [me]_p10248 a considerable shock, but [Van Helsing]_n1182 was unmoved.",2,,21,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p10250 was now more sure than ever of [his]_p10251 ground, and so emboldened to proceed in [his]_p10252 task. ""Are [you]_p10253 satisfied now, friend John?"" [he]_p10254 asked. [I]_p10255 felt all the dogged argumentativeness of [my]_p10258 nature awake within [me]_p10259 as [I]_p10256 answered him:,   ""I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin but that only proves one thing. ""  ""And what is that, friend John?""  ""That [it]_p10260 is not there. ""  ""That is good logic,"" [he]_p10261 said, ""so far as [it]_p10262 goes. But how do you, how can you, account for [it]_p10263 not being there?""  ""Perhaps a body-snatcher,"" [I]_p10264 suggested. ""Some of the undertaker's people may have stolen it. "" [I]_p10265 felt that [I]_p10266 was speaking folly, and yet [it]_p10268 was the only real cause which [I]_p10266 could suggest. The [Professor]_n1183 sighed. ""Ah well!"" [he]_p10269 said, ""we must have more proof.",1,,19,
stoker_dracula," Come with me. ""  [He]_p10270 put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all [his]_p10271 things and placed [them]_p10272 in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag. [We]_p10273 opened the door, and went out. Behind [us]_p10274 [he]_p10275 closed the door and locked it. [He]_p10276 handed [me]_p10277 the key, saying: ""Will [you]_p10278 keep it? [You]_p10279 had better be assured. "" [I]_p10280 laughed, [it]_p10283 was not a very cheerful laugh, [I]_p10281 am bound to say, as [I]_p10281 motioned [him]_p10285 to keep it. ""A key is nothing,"" [I]_p10286 said  ""there may be duplicates and anyhow [it]_p10287 is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind. "" [He]_p10288 said nothing, but put the key in [his]_p10289 pocket. Then [he]_p10290 told [me]_p10292 to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst [he]_p10291 would watch at the other. [I]_p10293 took up [my]_p10295 place behind a yew-tree, and [I]_p10294 saw [his]_p10297 dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid [it]_p10298 from [my]_p10296 sight.",0,,28,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p10299 was a lonely vigil. Just after [I]_p10300 had taken [my]_p10302 place [I]_p10301 heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. [I]_p10303 was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the [Professor]_n1184 for taking [me]_p10304 on such an errand and with [myself]_p10305 for coming. [I]_p10306 was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray [my]_p10308 trust so altogether [I]_p10307 had a dreary, miserable time. Suddenly, as [I]_p10309 turned round, [I]_p10310 thought [I]_p10310 saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb at the same time a dark mass moved from the [Professor]_n's1185 side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then [I]_p10312 too moved but [I]_p10313 had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and [I]_p10313 stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb [itself]_p10315 was hidden by trees, and [I]_p10316 could not see where the figure disappeared. [I]_p10317 heard the rustle of actual movement where [I]_p10318 had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the [Professor]_n1186 holding in [his]_p10319 arms a tiny child.",3,,21,
stoker_dracula," When [he]_p10320 saw [me]_p10322 [he]_p10321 held [it]_p10324 out to me, and said:,   ""Are [you]_p10325 satisfied now?""  ""No,"" [I]_p10326 said, in a way that [I]_p10327 felt was aggressive. ""Do [you]_p10328 not see the child?""  ""Yes, [it]_p10329 is a child, but who brought [it]_p10330 here? And is [it]_p10330 wounded?"" [I]_p10332 asked. ""We shall see,"" said the [Professor]_n,1187 and with one impulse [we]_p10333 took [our]_p10334 way out of the churchyard, [he]_p10335 carrying the sleeping child. When [we]_p10336 had got some little distance away, [we]_p10337 went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. [It]_p10338 was without a scratch or scar of any kind. ""Was [I]_p10339 right?"" [I]_p10340 asked triumphantly. ""We were just in time,"" said the [Professor]_n1188 thankfully. [We]_p10341 had now to decide what [we]_p10342 were to do with the child, and so consulted about it. If [we]_p10343 were to take [it]_p10347 to a police-station [we]_p10344 should have to give some account of [our]_p10348 movements during the night at least, [we]_p10344 should have had to make some statement as to how [we]_p10345 had come to find the child. So finally [we]_p10349 decided that [we]_p10350 would take [it]_p10354 to the Heath, and when [we]_p10350 heard a policeman coming, would leave [it]_p10355 where [he]_p10357 could not fail to find [it]_p10355 [we]_p10351 would then seek [our]_p10358 way home as quickly as [we]_p10351 could.",2,,38,
stoker_dracula," All fell out well. At the edge of [Hampstead Heath]_n1189 [we]_p10359 heard a policeman's heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, [we]_p10360 waited and watched until [he]_p10361 saw [it]_p10363 as [he]_p10362 flashed [his]_p10364 lantern to and fro. [We]_p10365 heard [his]_p10366 exclamation of astonishment, and then [we]_p10367 went away silently. By good chance [we]_p10368 got a cab near the ""Spaniards,"" and drove to town. [I]_p10369 cannot sleep, so [I]_p10370 make this entry. But [I]_p10371 must try to get a few hours' sleep, as [Van Helsing]_n1190 is to call for [me]_p10372 at noon. [He]_p10373 insists that [I]_p10374 shall go with [him]_p10375 on another expedition. * * * * *  27 September. , [It]_p10376 was two o'clock before [we]_p10377 found a suitable opportunity for [our]_p10378 attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken [themselves]_p10379 lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, [we]_p10380 saw the sexton lock the gate after him.",2,,22,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p10381 knew then that [we]_p10382 were safe till morning did [we]_p10383 desire [it]_p10385 but the [Professor]_n1191 told [me]_p10386 that [we]_p10383 should not want more than an hour at most. Again [I]_p10387 felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place and [I]_p10388 realised distinctly the perils of the law which [we]_p10389 were incurring in [our]_p10390 unhallowed work. Besides, [I]_p10391 felt [it]_p10392 was all so useless. Outrageous as [it]_p10393 was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, [it]_p10394 now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when [we]_p10395 knew, from the evidence of [our]_p10396 own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. [I]_p10397 shrugged [my]_p10398 shoulders, however, and rested silent, for [Van Helsing]_n1192 had a way of going on [his]_p10399 own road, no matter who remonstrated. [He]_p10400 took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned [me]_p10401 to precede. The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine streamed in. [Van Helsing]_n1193 walked over to [Lucy]_n's1194 coffin, and [I]_p10402 followed. [He]_p10403 bent over and again forced back the leaden flange and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me. There lay Lucy, seemingly just as [we]_p10404 had seen [her]_p10405 the night before [her]_p10406 funeral.",4,,26,
stoker_dracula," [She]_p10407 was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever and [I]_p10408 could not believe that [she]_p10409 was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom. ""Is this a juggle?"" [I]_p10410 said to him. ""Are [you]_p10411 convinced now?"" said the [Professor]_n1195 in response, and as [he]_p10412 spoke [he]_p10413 put over [his]_p10414 hand, and in a way that made [me]_p10415 shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth. ""See,"" [he]_p10416 went on, ""see, [they]_p10417 are even sharper than before. With this and this"", and [he]_p10418 touched one of the canine teeth and that below it, ""the little children can be bitten. Are [you]_p10419 of belief now, friend John?"" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. [I]_p10420 could not accept such an overwhelming idea as [he]_p10423 suggested so, with an attempt to argue of which [I]_p10421 was even at the moment ashamed, [I]_p10421 said:,   ""She may have been placed here since last night. ""  ""Indeed? That is so, and by whom?""  ""I do not know. Some one has done it.",1,,17,
stoker_dracula," ""  ""And yet [she]_p10424 has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not look so. "" [I]_p10425 had no answer for this, so was silent. [Van Helsing]_n1196 did not seem to notice [my]_p10426 silence at any rate, [he]_p10427 showed neither chagrin nor triumph. [He]_p10428 was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth. Then [he]_p10429 turned to [me]_p10430 and said:,   ""Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded here is some dual life that is not as the common. [She]_p10431 was bitten by the vampire when [she]_p10432 was in a trance, sleep-walking, oh, [you]_p10433 start [you]_p10434 do not know that, friend John, but [you]_p10434 shall know [it]_p10436 all later, and in trance could [he]_p10437 best come to take more blood. In trance [she]_p10438 died, and in trance [she]_p10439 is [Un-Dead]_n,1197 too. So [it]_p10440 is that [she]_p10441 differ from all other. Usually when the [Un-Dead]_n1198 sleep at home"", as [he]_p10442 spoke [he]_p10443 made a comprehensive sweep of [his]_p10444 arm to designate what to a vampire was ""home"", ""their face show what [they]_p10445 are, but this so sweet that was when [she]_p10446 not [Un-Dead]_n1199 [she]_p10447 go back to the nothings of the common dead.",4,,24,
stoker_dracula," There is no malign there, see, and so [it]_p10448 make hard that [I]_p10449 must kill [her]_p10450 in [her]_p10451 sleep. "" This turned [my]_p10452 blood cold, and [it]_p10454 began to dawn upon [me]_p10455 that [I]_p10458 was accepting [Van Helsing]_n's1200 theories but if [she]_p10460 were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her? [He]_p10461 looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in [my]_p10453 face, for [he]_p10462 said almost joyously:, ""Ah, [you]_p10463 believe now?"" [I]_p10459 answered: ""Do not press [me]_p10456 too hard all at once. [I]_p10464 am willing to accept. How will [you]_p10465 do this bloody work?""  ""I shall cut off [her]_p10468 head and fill [her]_p10469 mouth with garlic, and [I]_p10466 shall drive a stake through [her]_p10469 body. "" [It]_p10471 made [me]_p10472 shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom [I]_p10473 had loved. And yet the feeling was not so strong as [I]_p10474 had expected. [I]_p10475 was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being, this [Un-Dead]_n,1201 as [Van Helsing]_n1202 called it, and to loathe it. Is [it]_p10476 possible that love is all subjective, or all objective? [I]_p10477 waited a considerable time for [Van Helsing]_n1203 to begin, but [he]_p10478 stood as if wrapped in thought. Presently [he]_p10479 closed the catch of [his]_p10480 bag with a snap, and said:,   ""I have been thinking, and have made up [my]_p10481 mind as to what is best. If [I]_p10482 did simply follow [my]_p10484 inclining [I]_p10483 would do now, at this moment, what is to be done but there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that [them]_p10485 [we]_p10486 do not know.",4,,37,
stoker_dracula," This is simple. [She]_p10487 have yet no life taken, though that is of time and to act now would be to take danger from [her]_p10488 for ever. But then [we]_p10489 may have to want [Arthur]_n,1204 and how shall [we]_p10490 tell [him]_p10491 of this? If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at the hospital if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after [she]_p10497 die, if [you]_p10493 know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of [your]_p10499 own senses [you]_p10494 did not believe, how, then, can [I]_p10500 expect [Arthur]_n,1205 who know none of those things, to believe? [He]_p10502 doubted [me]_p10503 when [I]_p10501 took [him]_p10492 from [her]_p10504 kiss when [she]_p10498 was dying. [I]_p10505 know [he]_p10507 has forgiven [me]_p10510 because in some mistaken idea [I]_p10506 have done things that prevent [him]_p10511 say good-bye as [he]_p10508 ought and [he]_p10508 may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive and that in most mistake of all [we]_p10512 have killed her. [He]_p10513 will then argue back that [it]_p10514 is we, mistaken ones, that have killed [her]_p10515 by [our]_p10516 ideas and so [he]_p10517 will be much unhappy always. Yet [he]_p10518 never can be sure and that is the worst of all. And [he]_p10519 will sometimes think that [she]_p10522 [he]_p10520 loved was buried alive, and that will paint [his]_p10524 dreams with horrors of what [she]_p10523 must have suffered and again, [he]_p10520 will think that [we]_p10526 may be right, and that [his]_p10525 so beloved was, after all, an [Un-Dead]_n1206. No! [I]_p10527 told [him]_p10529 once, and since then [I]_p10528 learn much. Now, since [I]_p10530 know [it]_p10532 is all true, a hundred thousand times more do [I]_p10531 know that [he]_p10533 must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet.

The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky. [We]_p10842 all kept somehow close together, with [Van Helsing]_n1273 slightly in front as [he]_p10843 led the way. When [we]_p10844 had come close to the tomb [I]_p10845 looked well at [Arthur]_n,1274 for [I]_p10846 feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset [him]_p10847 but [he]_p10848 bore [himself]_p10849 well. [I]_p10850 took [it]_p10851 that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to [his]_p10852 grief. The [Professor]_n1275 unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst [us]_p10853 for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself.",6,,28,
stoker_dracula," The [rest]_n1276 of [us]_p10854 followed, and [he]_p10855 closed the door. [He]_p10856 then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. [Arthur]_n1277 stepped forward hesitatingly [Van Helsing]_n1278 said to me:, ""You were with [me]_p10857 here yesterday. Was the body of [Miss Lucy]_n1279 in that coffin?"" ""It was. "" The [Professor]_n1280 turned to the rest saying:, ""You hear and yet there is no one who does not believe with me. "" [He]_p10859 took [his]_p10860 screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. [Arthur]_n1281 looked on, very pale but silent when the lid was removed [he]_p10861 stepped forward. [He]_p10862 evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it. When [he]_p10863 saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to [his]_p10866 face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that [he]_p10864 remained of a ghastly whiteness [he]_p10864 was still silent. [Van Helsing]_n1282 forced back the leaden flange, and [we]_p10867 all looked in and recoiled.",7,,13,
stoker_dracula," The coffin was empty!  For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by [Quincey]_n1283 Morris:, ""[Professor]_n,1284 [I]_p10868 answered for you.

[I]_p10871 wouldn't ask such a thing ordinarily, [I]_p10872 wouldn't so dishonour [you]_p10873 as to imply a doubt but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.

[I]_p10881 opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and [we]_p10882 found it, as now, empty. [We]_p10883 then waited, and saw something white come through the trees. The next day [we]_p10884 came here in [day-time]_n,1286 and [she]_p10885 lay there. Did [she]_p10886 not, friend John?""  ""Yes.",4,,18,

[It]_p10892 was most probable that [it]_p10893 was because [I]_p10894 had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the [Un-Dead]_n1288 cannot bear, and other things which [they]_p10895 shun. Last night there was no exodus, so [to-night]_n1289 before the sundown [I]_p10896 took away [my]_p10897 garlic and other things. And so [it]_p10898 is [we]_p10899 find this coffin empty.

"" [He]_p10904 opened the door, and [we]_p10905 filed out, [he]_p10906 coming last and locking the door behind him. Oh! but [it]_p10907 seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault. How sweet [it]_p10908 was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing, like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life how sweet [it]_p10909 was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and [decay]_n1290 how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each in [his]_p10910 own way was solemn and overcome. [Arthur]_n1291 was silent, and was, [I]_p10911 could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery. [I]_p10912 was [myself]_p10913 tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept [Van Helsing]_n's1292 conclusions. [Quincey]_n1293 Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts [them]_p10914 in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all [he]_p10915 has to stake. Not being able to smoke, [he]_p10916 cut [himself]_p10917 a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to [Van Helsing]_n,1294 [he]_p10918 was employed in a definite way.",5,,17,
stoker_dracula," First [he]_p10919 took from [his]_p10921 bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin next [he]_p10920 took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty. [He]_p10922 crumbled the wafer up fine and worked [it]_p10923 into the mass between [his]_p10924 hands. This [he]_p10925 then took, and rolling [it]_p10926 into thin strips, began to lay [them]_p10927 into the crevices between the door and [its]_p10928 setting in the tomb. [I]_p10929 was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked [him]_p10930 what [it]_p10931 was that [he]_p10932 was doing. [Arthur]_n1295 and [Quincey]_n1296 drew near also, as [they]_p10933 too were curious. [He]_p10934 answered:, ""I am closing the tomb, so that the [Un-Dead]_n1297 may not enter. "" ""And is that stuff [you]_p10935 have put there going to do it?"" asked [Quincey]_n1298. ""[Great]_n1299 Scott! Is this a game?"" ""It is. "" ""What is that which [you]_p10936 are using?"" This time the question was by [Arthur]_n1300. [Van Helsing]_n1301 reverently lifted [his]_p10937 hat as [he]_p10938 answered:, ""The Host.",7,,20,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p10939 brought [it]_p10940 from [Amsterdam]_n1302. [I]_p10941 have an Indulgence. "" [It]_p10942 was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and [we]_p10943 felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the [Professor]_n's,1303 a purpose which could thus use the to [him]_p10944 most sacred of things, [it]_p10945 was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence [we]_p10946 took the places assigned to [us]_p10947 close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. [I]_p10948 pitied the others, especially [Arthur]_n1304. [I]_p10949 had [myself]_p10951 been apprenticed by [my]_p10952 former visits to this watching horror and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt [my]_p10953 heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously never did bough creak so mysteriously and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night. There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the [Professor]_n1305 a keen ""S-s-s-s!"" [He]_p10954 pointed and far down the avenue of yews [we]_p10955 saw a white figure advance, a dim white figure, which held something dark at [its]_p10956 breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave. [We]_p10957 could not see the face, for [it]_p10958 was bent down over what [we]_p10959 saw to be a fair-haired child.",4,,20,
stoker_dracula," There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as [it]_p10960 lies before the fire and dreams. [We]_p10961 were starting forward, but the [Professor]_n's1306 warning hand, seen by [us]_p10962 as [he]_p10964 stood behind a yew-tree, kept [us]_p10963 back and then as [we]_p10965 looked the white figure moved forwards again. [It]_p10966 was now near enough for [us]_p10967 to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. [My]_p10968 own heart grew cold as ice, and [I]_p10969 could hear the gasp of [Arthur]_n,1307 as [we]_p10970 recognised the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness. [Van Helsing]_n1308 stepped out, and, obedient to [his]_p10971 gesture, [we]_p10972 all advanced too the four of [us]_p10973 ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. [Van Helsing]_n1309 raised [his]_p10974 lantern and drew the slide by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face [we]_p10975 could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over [her]_p10976 chin and stained the purity of [her]_p10977 lawn death-robe. [We]_p10978 shuddered with horror. [I]_p10979 could see by the tremulous light that even [Van Helsing]_n's1310 iron nerve had failed.",5,,20,
stoker_dracula," [Arthur]_n1311 was next to me, and if [I]_p10980 had not seized [his]_p10981 arm and held [him]_p10982 up, [he]_p10983 would have fallen. When Lucy, [I]_p10984 call the thing that was before [us]_p10985 Lucy because [it]_p10988 bore [her]_p10989 shape, saw [us]_p10986 [she]_p10991 drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares then [her]_p10990 eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form and colour but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs [we]_p10992 knew. At that moment the remnant of [my]_p10993 love passed into hate and loathing had [she]_p10994 then to be killed, [I]_p10995 could have done [it]_p10996 with savage delight. As [she]_p10997 looked, [her]_p10998 eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how [it]_p10999 made [me]_p11002 shudder to see it! With a careless motion, [she]_p11003 flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now [she]_p11004 had clutched strenuously to [her]_p11005 breast, growling over [it]_p11000 as a dog growls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from [Arthur]_n1312 when [she]_p11006 advanced to [him]_p11007 with outstretched arms and a wanton smile [he]_p11008 fell back and hid [his]_p11009 face in [his]_p11010 hands. [She]_p11011 still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said:,   ""Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me.",2,,30,
stoker_dracula," [My]_p11012 arms are hungry for you. Come, and [we]_p11013 can rest together. Come, [my]_p11014 husband, come!""  There was something diabolically sweet in [her]_p11015 tones, something of the tingling of glass when struck, which rang through the brains even of [us]_p11016 who heard the words addressed to another. As for [Arthur]_n,1313 [he]_p11017 seemed under a spell moving [his]_p11019 hands from [his]_p11020 face, [he]_p11018 opened wide [his]_p11020 arms. [She]_p11022 was leaping for them, when [Van Helsing]_n1314 sprang forward and held between [them]_p11023 [his]_p11025 little golden crucifix. [She]_p11026 recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past [him]_p11027 as if to enter the tomb. When within a foot or two of the door, however, [she]_p11028 stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force. Then [she]_p11029 turned, and [her]_p11030 face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from [Van Helsing]_n's1315 iron nerves. Never did [I]_p11031 see such baffled malice on a face and never, [I]_p11032 trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese.",3,,20,
stoker_dracula," If ever a face meant death, if looks could kill, [we]_p11033 saw [it]_p11034 at that moment. And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, [she]_p11035 remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of [her]_p11036 means of entry. [Van Helsing]_n1316 broke the silence by asking [Arthur]_n:,1317 ""Answer me, oh [my]_p11037 friend! Am [I]_p11039 to proceed in [my]_p11038 work?"" [Arthur]_n1318 threw [himself]_p11040 on [his]_p11041 knees, and hid [his]_p11042 face in [his]_p11042 hands, as [he]_p11044 answered:, ""Do as [you]_p11045 will, friend do as [you]_p11046 will. There can be no horror like this ever any more "" and [he]_p11047 groaned in spirit. [Quincey]_n1319 and [I]_p11048 simultaneously moved towards him, and took [his]_p11049 arms. [We]_p11050 could hear the click of the closing lantern as [Van Helsing]_n1320 held [it]_p11051 down coming close to the tomb, [he]_p11052 began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which [he]_p11053 had placed there. [We]_p11054 all looked on in horrified amazement as [we]_p11055 saw, when [he]_p11056 stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as [our]_p11057 own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. [We]_p11058 all felt a glad sense of relief when [we]_p11059 saw the [Professor]_n1321 calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door. When this was done, [he]_p11060 lifted the child and said:  ""Come now, [my]_p11061 friends [we]_p11062 can do no more till to-morrow. There is a funeral at noon, so here [we]_p11063 shall all come before long after that.",6,,31,
stoker_dracula," The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock the gate [we]_p11064 shall remain. Then there is more to do but not like this of [to-night]_n1322. As for this little one, [he]_p11065 is not much harm, and by [to-morrow]_n1323 night [he]_p11066 shall be well. [We]_p11067 shall leave [him]_p11068 where the police will find him, as on the other night and then to home. "" Coming close to Arthur, [he]_p11070 said:,   ""My friend Arthur, [you]_p11071 have had a sore trial but after, when [you]_p11072 look back, [you]_p11072 will see how [it]_p11074 was necessary. [You]_p11075 are now in the bitter waters, [my]_p11076 child. By this time to-morrow [you]_p11077 will, please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters so do not mourn overmuch. Till then [I]_p11078 shall not ask [you]_p11079 to forgive me. "" [Arthur]_n1324 and [Quincey]_n1325 came home with me, and [we]_p11080 tried to cheer each other on the way. [We]_p11081 had left the child in safety, and were tired so [we]_p11082 all slept with more or less reality of sleep.",4,,18,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  29 September, night. , A little before twelve o'clock [we]_p11083 three, [Arthur]_n,1326 [Quincey]_n1327 Morris, and myself, called for the [Professor]_n1328. [It]_p11084 was odd to notice that by common consent [we]_p11085 had all put on black clothes. Of course, [Arthur]_n1329 wore black, for [he]_p11086 was in deep mourning, but the rest of [us]_p11087 wore [it]_p11088 by instinct. [We]_p11089 got to the churchyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed [their]_p11090 task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, [we]_p11091 had the place all to ourselves. [Van Helsing]_n,1330 instead of [his]_p11092 little black bag, had with [him]_p11093 a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag [it]_p11094 was manifestly of fair weight. When [we]_p11095 were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, [we]_p11096 silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the [Professor]_n1331 to the tomb. [He]_p11097 unlocked the door, and [we]_p11098 entered, closing [it]_p11099 behind us. Then [he]_p11100 took from [his]_p11103 bag the lantern, which [he]_p11101 lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, [he]_p11101 stuck, by melting [their]_p11104 own ends, on other coffins, so that [they]_p11105 might give light sufficient to work by. When [he]_p11106 again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin [we]_p11107 all looked, [Arthur]_n1332 trembling like an aspen, and saw that the body lay there in all [its]_p11108 death-beauty.",7,,26,
stoker_dracula," But there was no love in [my]_p11109 own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without [her]_p11110 soul. [I]_p11111 could see even [Arthur]_n's1333 face grow hard as [he]_p11112 looked. Presently [he]_p11113 said to [Van]_n1334 Helsing:, ""Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in [her]_p11114 shape?"" ""It is [her]_p11115 body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and [you]_p11116 all see [her]_p11117 as [she]_p11118 was, and is. "" [She]_p11119 seemed like a nightmare of [Lucy]_n1335 as [she]_p11120 lay there the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth, which [it]_p11121 made one shudder to see, the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of [Lucy]_n's1336 sweet purity. [Van Helsing]_n,1337 with [his]_p11122 usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from [his]_p11123 bag and placing [them]_p11124 ready for use. First [he]_p11125 took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame then [his]_p11127 operating knives, which [he]_p11126 placed to hand and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of [it]_p11128 was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both [Arthur]_n1338 and [Quincey]_n1339 was to cause [them]_p11129 a sort of consternation.",7,,21,
stoker_dracula," [They]_p11130 both, however, kept [their]_p11131 courage, and remained silent and quiet. When all was ready, [Van Helsing]_n1340 said:, ""Before [we]_p11132 do anything, let [me]_p11133 tell [you]_p11134 this [it]_p11135 is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the [Un-Dead]_n1341. When [they]_p11136 become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality [they]_p11137 cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world for all that die from the preying of the [Un-Dead]_n1342 becomes [themselves]_p11138 [Un-Dead]_n,1343 and prey on [their]_p11139 kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if [you]_p11140 had met that kiss which [you]_p11141 know of before poor Lucy die or again, last night when [you]_p11141 open [your]_p11145 arms to her, [you]_p11142 would in time, when [you]_p11142 had died, have become nosferatu, as [they]_p11146 call [it]_p11147 in Eastern Europe, and would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill [us]_p11148 with horror. The career of this so unhappy [dear]_n1344 lady is but just begun. Those children whose blood [she]_p11149 suck are not as yet so much the worse but if [she]_p11150 live on, [Un-Dead]_n,1345 more and more [they]_p11152 lose [their]_p11154 blood and by [her]_p11156 power over [them]_p11158 [they]_p11153 come to [her]_p11157 and so [she]_p11150 draw [their]_p11155 blood with that so wicked mouth. But if [she]_p11159 die in truth, then all cease the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and [they]_p11160 go back to [their]_p11161 plays unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when this now [Un-Dead]_n1346 be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom [we]_p11162 love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of [it]_p11163 by day, [she]_p11164 shall take [her]_p11165 place with the other Angels.",7,,36,
stoker_dracula," So that, [my]_p11166 friend, [it]_p11167 will be a blessed hand for [her]_p11168 that shall strike the blow that sets [her]_p11169 free. To this [I]_p11170 am willing but is there none amongst [us]_p11171 who has a better right? Will [it]_p11173 be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not: 'It was [my]_p11176 hand that sent [her]_p11177 to the stars [it]_p11174 was the hand of [him]_p11180 that loved [her]_p11178 best the hand that of all [she]_p11181 would [herself]_p11182 have chosen, had [it]_p11174 been to [her]_p11178 to choose?' Tell [me]_p11183 if there be such a one amongst us?"" [We]_p11184 all looked at [Arthur]_n1347. [He]_p11185 saw, too, what [we]_p11186 all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that [his]_p11187 should be the hand which would restore Lucy to [us]_p11190 as a holy, and not an unholy, memory [he]_p11191 stepped forward and said bravely, though [his]_p11188 hand trembled, and [his]_p11188 face was as pale as snow:,   ""My true friend, from the bottom of [my]_p11192 broken heart [I]_p11193 thank you. Tell [me]_p11194 what [I]_p11195 am to do, and [I]_p11196 shall not falter!"" [Van Helsing]_n1348 laid a hand on [his]_p11197 shoulder, and said:, ""Brave lad! A moment's courage, and [it]_p11198 is done. This stake must be driven through her. [It]_p11199 will be a fearful ordeal, be not deceived in that, but [it]_p11200 will be only a short time, and [you]_p11201 will then rejoice more than [your]_p11204 pain was great from this grim tomb [you]_p11202 will emerge as though [you]_p11202 tread on air. But [you]_p11205 must not falter when once [you]_p11206 have begun. Only think that we, [your]_p11209 true friends, are round you, and that [we]_p11207 pray for [you]_p11210 all the time. "" ""Go on,"" said [Arthur]_n1349 hoarsely. ""Tell [me]_p11212 what [I]_p11213 am to do.",3,,45,
stoker_dracula," ""  ""Take this stake in [your]_p11214 left hand, ready to place the point over the heart, and the hammer in [your]_p11215 right. Then when [we]_p11216 begin [our]_p11218 prayer for the dead, [I]_p11219 shall read him, [I]_p11220 have here the book, and the others shall follow, strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that [we]_p11217 love and that the [Un-Dead]_n1350 pass away. "" [Arthur]_n1351 took the stake and the hammer, and when once [his]_p11221 mind was set on action [his]_p11222 hands never trembled nor even quivered. [Van Helsing]_n1352 opened [his]_p11223 missal and began to read, and [Quincey]_n1353 and [I]_p11224 followed as well as [we]_p11225 could. [Arthur]_n1354 placed the point over the heart, and as [I]_p11226 looked [I]_p11227 could see [its]_p11228 dint in the white flesh. Then [he]_p11229 struck with all [his]_p11230 might. The Thing in the coffin writhed and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But [Arthur]_n1355 never faltered. [He]_p11231 looked like a figure of Thor as [his]_p11232 untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it.",6,,19,
stoker_dracula," [His]_p11233 face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through [it]_p11234 the sight of [it]_p11235 gave [us]_p11236 courage so that [our]_p11237 voices seemed to ring through the little vault. And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally [it]_p11238 lay still. The terrible task was over. The hammer fell from [Arthur]_n's1356 hand. [He]_p11239 reeled and would have fallen had [we]_p11240 not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from [his]_p11241 forehead, and [his]_p11242 breath came in broken gasps. [It]_p11243 had indeed been an awful strain on [him]_p11244 and had [he]_p11245 not been forced to [his]_p11247 task by more than human considerations [he]_p11246 could never have gone through with it. For a few minutes [we]_p11248 were so taken up with [him]_p11250 that [we]_p11249 did not look towards the coffin. When [we]_p11251 did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us.",1,,19,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p11252 gazed so eagerly that [Arthur]_n1357 rose, for [he]_p11253 had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too and then a glad, strange light broke over [his]_p11254 face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it. There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that [we]_p11255 had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of [her]_p11257 destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as [we]_p11256 had seen [her]_p11258 in [her]_p11258 life, with [her]_p11259 face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that there were there, as [we]_p11261 had seen [them]_p11263 in life, the traces of care and pain and waste but these were all [dear]_n1358 to us, for [they]_p11264 marked [her]_p11265 truth to what [we]_p11262 knew. One and all [we]_p11266 felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever. [Van Helsing]_n1359 came and laid [his]_p11267 hand on [Arthur]_n's1360 shoulder, and said to him:, ""And now, [Arthur]_n1361 [my]_p11270 friend, [[dear]_n]_n1362 lad, am [I]_p11272 not forgiven?"" The reaction of the terrible strain came as [he]_p11273 took the old man's hand in his, and raising [it]_p11274 to [his]_p11268 lips, pressed it, and said:, ""Forgiven! God bless [you]_p11276 that [you]_p11277 have given [my]_p11[271 ]_ndear1363 one [her]_p11278 soul again, and [me]_p11279 peace. "" [He]_p11280 put [his]_p11281 hands on the [Professor]_n's1364 shoulder, and laying [his]_p11282 head on [his]_p11282 breast, cried for a while silently, whilst [we]_p11284 stood unmoving. When [he]_p11285 raised [his]_p11286 head [Van Helsing]_n1365 said to him:, ""And now, [my]_p11287 child, [you]_p11288 may kiss her.

Then [we]_p11301 cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic. [We]_p11302 soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid, and gathering up [our]_p11303 belongings, came away. When the [Professor]_n1371 locked the door [he]_p11304 gave the key to [Arthur]_n1372. Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and [it]_p11305 seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for [we]_p11306 were at rest [ourselves]_p11308 on one account, and [we]_p11307 were glad, though [it]_p11309 was with a tempered joy. Before [we]_p11310 moved away [Van Helsing]_n1373 said:, ""Now, [my]_p11311 friends, one step of [our]_p11312 work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author of all this [our]_p11313 sorrow and to stamp [him]_p11314 out. [I]_p11315 have clues which [we]_p11316 can follow but [it]_p11317 is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in it, and pain. Shall [you]_p11319 not all help me? [We]_p11320 have learned to believe, all of us, is [it]_p11321 not so? And since so, do [we]_p11322 not see [our]_p11325 duty? Yes! And do [we]_p11323 not promise to go on to the bitter end?""  Each in turn, [we]_p11323 took [his]_p11326 hand, and the promise was made.",7,,30,

""  When the wire was despatched [he]_p11357 had a cup of tea over [it]_p11359 [he]_p11358 told [me]_p11361 of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave [me]_p11362 a typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs Harker's diary at Whitby. ""Take these,"" [he]_p11363 said, ""and study [them]_p11364 well. When [I]_p11365 have returned [you]_p11366 will be master of all the facts, and [we]_p11367 can then better enter on [our]_p11368 inquisition.",5,,20,

[I]_p11390 took [my]_p11392 way to Paddington, where [I]_p11391 arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in. The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms and [I]_p11393 was beginning to feel uneasy, lest [I]_p11394 might miss [my]_p11396 guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and, after a quick glance, said: ""Dr [Seward]_n,1388 is [it]_p11397 not?"" ""And [you]_p11398 are Mrs Harker!"" [I]_p11394 answered at once whereupon [she]_p11399 held out [her]_p11400 hand. ""I knew [you]_p11401 from the description of poor [dear]_n1389 Lucy but, , "" [She]_p11402 stopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread [her]_p11403 face. The blush that rose to [my]_p11404 own cheeks somehow set [us]_p11405 both at ease, for [it]_p11406 was a tacit answer to [her]_p11407 own.",4,,38,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p11408 got [her]_p11410 luggage, which included a typewriter, and [we]_p11411 took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after [I]_p11409 had sent a wire to [my]_p11412 housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom prepared at once for Mrs Harker. In due time [we]_p11413 arrived. [She]_p11414 knew, of course, that the place was a lunatic asylum, but [I]_p11415 could see that [she]_p11416 was unable to repress a shudder when [we]_p11417 entered. [She]_p11418 told [me]_p11419 that, if [she]_p11420 might, [she]_p11421 would come presently to [my]_p11423 study, as [she]_p11421 had much to say. So here [I]_p11424 am finishing [my]_p11426 entry in [my]_p11427 phonograph diary whilst [I]_p11425 await her. As yet [I]_p11428 have not had the chance of looking at the papers which [Van Helsing]_n1390 left with me, though [they]_p11429 lie open before me. [I]_p11430 must get [her]_p11432 interested in something, so that [I]_p11431 may have an opportunity of reading them. [She]_p11433 does not know how precious time is, or what a task [we]_p11434 have in hand. [I]_p11435 must be careful not to frighten her. Here [she]_p11436 is! Mina Harker's [Journal]_n1391.",2,,29,
stoker_dracula," 29 September. , After [I]_p11437 had tidied myself, [I]_p11438 went down to Dr [Seward]_n's1392 study. At the door [I]_p11439 paused a moment, for [I]_p11440 thought [I]_p11440 heard [him]_p11442 talking with some one. As, however, [he]_p11443 had pressed [me]_p11444 to be quick, [I]_p11445 knocked at the door, and on [his]_p11447 calling out, ""Come in,"" [I]_p11446 entered. To [my]_p11448 intense surprise, there was no one with him. [He]_p11449 was quite alone, and on the table opposite [him]_p11450 was what [I]_p11451 knew at once from the description to be a phonograph. [I]_p11452 had never seen one, and was much interested. ""I hope [I]_p11453 did not keep [you]_p11458 waiting,"" [I]_p11454 said ""but [I]_p11454 stayed at the door as [I]_p11455 heard [you]_p11459 talking, and thought there was some one with you. ""  ""Oh,"" [he]_p11461 replied with a smile, ""I was only entering [my]_p11462 diary. ""  ""Your diary?"" [I]_p11463 asked [him]_p11464 in surprise.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," ""Yes,"" [he]_p11465 answered. ""I keep [it]_p11466 in this. "" As [he]_p11467 spoke [he]_p11468 laid [his]_p11469 hand on the phonograph. [I]_p11470 felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:,   ""Why, this beats even shorthand! May [I]_p11471 hear [it]_p11472 say something?""  ""Certainly,"" [he]_p11475 replied with alacrity, and stood up to put [it]_p11473 in train for speaking. Then [he]_p11476 paused, and a troubled look overspread [his]_p11477 face. ""The fact is,"" [he]_p11478 began awkwardly, ""I only keep [my]_p11482 diary in [it]_p11484 and as [it]_p11485 is entirely, almost entirely, about [my]_p11483 cases, [it]_p11485 may be awkward, that is, [I]_p11479 mean, , "" [He]_p11487 stopped, and [I]_p11480 tried to help [him]_p11488 out of [his]_p11489 embarrassment:, ""You helped to attend [dear]_n1393 Lucy at the end.

[I]_p11500 asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me. Again [he]_p11501 paused, and [I]_p11503 could see that [he]_p11502 was trying to invent an excuse.",2,,37,
stoker_dracula," At length [he]_p11504 stammered out:,   ""You see, [I]_p11505 do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary. "" Even while [he]_p11506 was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and [he]_p11507 said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the na vet  of a child: ""That's quite true, upon [my]_p11508 honour. Honest Indian!"" [I]_p11509 could not but smile, at which [he]_p11510 grimaced. ""I gave [myself]_p11511 away that time!"" [he]_p11512 said. ""But do [you]_p11513 know that, although [I]_p11516 have kept the diary for months past, [it]_p11520 never once struck [me]_p11524 how [I]_p11517 was going to find any particular part of [it]_p11521 in case [I]_p11517 wanted to look [it]_p11521 up?"" By this time [my]_p11526 mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of [our]_p11528 knowledge of that terrible Being, and [I]_p11518 said boldly:, ""Then, Dr [Seward]_n,1395 [you]_p11514 had better let [me]_p11525 copy [it]_p11522 out for [you]_p11514 on [my]_p11527 typewriter.

Then [it]_p11534 was terrible [my]_p11535 intuition was right! For a moment [I]_p11532 thought, and as [my]_p11536 eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me, [they]_p11537 lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table. [His]_p11538 eyes caught the look in mine, and, without [his]_p11539 thinking, followed [their]_p11540 direction. As [they]_p11541 saw the parcel [he]_p11542 realised [my]_p11543 meaning. ""You do not know me,"" [I]_p11544 said. ""When [you]_p11545 have read those papers, [my]_p11547 own diary and [my]_p11548 husband's also, which [I]_p11549 have typed, [you]_p11546 will know [me]_p11550 better.",1,,47,

"" [He]_p11558 is certainly a man of noble nature poor [dear]_n1396 [Lucy]_n1397 was right about him. [He]_p11559 stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and said:,   ""You are quite right. [I]_p11560 did not trust [you]_p11562 because [I]_p11561 did not know you. But [I]_p11564 know [you]_p11566 now and let [me]_p11568 say that [I]_p11565 should have known [you]_p11567 long ago.

[Dr Seward]_n's1399 [Diary]_n1400. 29 September. , [I]_p11594 was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of [his]_p11596 wife that [I]_p11595 let the time run on without thinking. Mrs Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner, so [I]_p11597 said: ""She is possibly tired let dinner wait an hour,"" and [I]_p11598 went on with [my]_p11599 work. [I]_p11600 had just finished Mrs Harker's diary, when [she]_p11601 came in. [She]_p11602 looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and [her]_p11603 eyes were flushed with crying. This somehow moved [me]_p11604 much. Of late [I]_p11605 have had cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of [them]_p11606 was denied [me]_p11607 and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went straight to [my]_p11608 heart.

[He]_p11691 placed [me]_p11692 in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that [I]_p11694 could touch [it]_p11696 without getting up, and showed [me]_p11693 how to stop [it]_p11697 in case [I]_p11695 should want to pause. Then [he]_p11698 very thoughtfully took a chair, with [his]_p11699 back to me, so that [I]_p11700 might be as free as possible, and began to read. [I]_p11701 put the forked metal to [my]_p11702 ears and listened. When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and, and all that followed, was done, [I]_p11703 lay back in [my]_p11704 chair powerless.

[It]_p11715 is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if [I]_p11716 had not known Jonathan's experience in [Transylvania]_n1412 [I]_p11717 could not have believed. As [it]_p11718 was, [I]_p11719 didn't know what to believe, and so got out of [my]_p11720 difficulty by attending to something else. [I]_p11721 took the cover off [my]_p11722 typewriter, and said to [Dr Seward]_n:,1413 ""Let [me]_p11723 write this all out now.

[It]_p11741 was late when [I]_p11742 got through, but Dr [Seward]_n1417 went about [his]_p11745 work of going [his]_p11746 round of the patients when [he]_p11747 had finished [he]_p11748 came back and sat near me, reading, so that [I]_p11743 did not feel too lonely whilst [I]_p11743 worked. How good and thoughtful [he]_p11749 is the world seems full of good men, even if there are monsters in it. Before [I]_p11750 left [him]_p11753 [I]_p11751 remembered what Jonathan put in [his]_p11754 diary of the [Professor]_n's1418 perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at [Exeter]_n1419 so, seeing that Dr [Seward]_n1420 keeps [his]_p11755 newspapers, [I]_p11751 borrowed the files of ""The [Westminster Gazette]_n""1421 and ""The [Pall Mall Gazette]_n,""1422 and took [them]_p11756 to [my]_p11757 room. [I]_p11758 remember how much ""The Dailygraph"" and ""The Whitby Gazette,"" of which [I]_p11759 had made cuttings, helped [us]_p11762 to understand the terrible events at Whitby when [Count Dracula]_n1423 landed, so [I]_p11759 shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps [I]_p11760 shall get some new light. [I]_p11763 am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep [me]_p11764 quiet. [Dr Seward]_n's1424 [Diary]_n1425. 30 September. , [Mr Harker]_n1426 arrived at nine o'clock.",10,,28,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p11765 had got [his]_p11766 wife's wire just before starting. [He]_p11767 is uncommonly clever, if [one]_p11768 can judge from [his]_p11769 face, and full of energy. If this journal be true, and judging by one's own wonderful experiences, [it]_p11770 must be, [he]_p11771 is also a man of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring. After reading [his]_p11772 account of [it]_p11773 [I]_p11774 was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, business-like gentleman who came here to-day. * * * * *  Later. , After lunch Harker and [his]_p11775 wife went back to [their]_p11776 own room, and as [I]_p11777 passed a while ago [I]_p11778 heard the click of the typewriter. [They]_p11779 are hard at it. Mrs Harker says that [they]_p11780 are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence [they]_p11781 have. Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them.",0,,17,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p11782 is now reading [his]_p11783 wife's typescript of [my]_p11784 diary. [I]_p11785 wonder what [they]_p11786 make out of it. Here [it]_p11787 is. Strange that [it]_p11788 never struck [me]_p11789 that the very next house might be the Count's hiding-place! Goodness knows that [we]_p11790 had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh, if [we]_p11791 had only had [them]_p11793 earlier [we]_p11792 might have saved poor Lucy! Stop that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collating [his]_p11794 material. [He]_p11795 says that by dinner-time [they]_p11796 will be able to show a whole connected narrative. [He]_p11797 thinks that in the meantime [I]_p11798 should see Renfield, as hitherto [he]_p11799 has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count. [I]_p11800 hardly see this yet, but when [I]_p11801 get at the dates [I]_p11801 suppose [I]_p11802 shall. What a good thing that [Mrs Harker]_n1427 put [my]_p11804 cylinders into type! [We]_p11805 never could have found the dates otherwise. [I]_p11806 found Renfield sitting placidly in [his]_p11807 room with [his]_p11808 hands folded, smiling benignly.",1,,27,
stoker_dracula," At the moment [he]_p11809 seemed as sane as any one [I]_p11810 ever saw. [I]_p11811 sat down and talked with [him]_p11812 on a lot of subjects, all of which [he]_p11813 treated naturally. [He]_p11814 then, of [his]_p11815 own accord, spoke of going home, a subject [he]_p11817 has never mentioned to [my]_p11818 knowledge during [his]_p11816 sojourn here. In fact, [he]_p11819 spoke quite confidently of getting [his]_p11820 discharge at once. [I]_p11821 believe that, had [I]_p11822 not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of [his]_p11824 outbursts, [I]_p11822 should have been prepared to sign for [him]_p11825 after a brief time of observation. As [it]_p11826 is, [I]_p11827 am darkly suspicious. All those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can [it]_p11828 be that [his]_p11829 instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph? Stay [he]_p11831 is [himself]_p11833 zo phagous, and in [his]_p11830 wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house [he]_p11832 always spoke of ""master. "" This all seems confirmation of [our]_p11834 idea. However, after a while [I]_p11835 came away [my]_p11836 friend is just a little too sane at present to make [it]_p11837 safe to probe [him]_p11838 too deep with questions.",0,,30,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p11839 might begin to think, and then, ! So [I]_p11840 came away. [I]_p11841 mistrust these quiet moods of [his]_p11843 so [I]_p11842 have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need. Jonathan Harker's [Journal]_n1428. 29 September, in train to [London]_n1429. , When [I]_p11844 received Mr [Billington]_n's1430 courteous message that [he]_p11847 would give [me]_p11848 any information in [his]_p11849 power [I]_p11845 thought [it]_p11850 best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as [I]_p11845 wanted. [It]_p11851 was now [my]_p11852 object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count's to [its]_p11853 place in London. Later, [we]_p11854 may be able to deal with it. [Billington]_n1431 junior, a nice lad, met [me]_p11855 at the station, and brought [me]_p11856 to [his]_p11857 father's house, where [they]_p11858 had decided that [I]_p11859 must stay the night. [They]_p11860 are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality: give a guest everything, and leave [him]_p11861 free to do as [he]_p11862 likes. [They]_p11863 all knew that [I]_p11864 was busy, and that [my]_p11865 stay was short, and Mr [Billington]_n1432 had ready in [his]_p11866 office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.",5,,28,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p11867 gave [me]_p11868 almost a turn to see again one of the letters which [I]_p11869 had seen on the Count's table before [I]_p11870 knew of [his]_p11871 diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision. [He]_p11872 seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of [his]_p11873 intentions being carried out. To use an Americanism, [he]_p11874 had ""taken no chances,"" and the absolute accuracy with which [his]_p11875 instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical result of [his]_p11876 care. [I]_p11877 saw the invoice, and took note of it: ""Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes. "" Also the copy of letter to [Carter Paterson]_n,1433 and [their]_p11878 reply of both of these [I]_p11879 got copies. This was all the information Mr [Billington]_n1434 could give me, so [I]_p11880 went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master. [They]_p11881 had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship, which is already taking [its]_p11882 place in local tradition but no one could add to the simple description ""Fifty cases of common earth. "" [I]_p11883 then saw the station-master, who kindly put [me]_p11884 in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. [Their]_p11885 tally was exact with the list, and [they]_p11886 had nothing to add except that the boxes were ""main and mortal heavy,"" and that shifting [them]_p11887 was dry work.",2,,21,
stoker_dracula," One of [them]_p11888 added that [it]_p11889 was hard lines that there wasn't any gentleman ""such-like as yourself, squire,"" to show some sort of appreciation of [their]_p11891 efforts in a liquid form another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, [I]_p11892 took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach. * * * * *  30 September. , The station-master was good enough to give [me]_p11893 a line to [his]_p11894 old companion the station-master at King's Cross, so that when [I]_p11895 arrived there in the morning [I]_p11896 was able to ask [him]_p11897 about the arrival of the boxes. He, too, put [me]_p11898 at once in communication with the proper officials, and [I]_p11899 saw that [their]_p11900 tally was correct with the original invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited a noble use of [them]_p11901 had, however, been made, and again [I]_p11902 was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner. From thence [I]_p11903 went on to [Carter Paterson]_n's1435 central office, where [I]_p11904 met with the utmost courtesy. [They]_p11905 looked up the transaction in [their]_p11906 day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to [their]_p11907 King's Cross office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent [them]_p11908 over, sending also by one of [them]_p11909 the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again [I]_p11910 found the tally agreeing exactly the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details.",1,,22,
stoker_dracula," These were, [I]_p11911 shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On [my]_p11912 affording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:,   ""That 'ere 'ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest [I]_p11913 ever was in. Blyme! but [it]_p11914 ain't been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in the place that [you]_p11915 might have slep' on [it]_p11916 without 'urtin' of yer bones an' the place was that neglected that yer might 'ave smelled ole [Jerusalem]_n1436 in it. But the ole chapel, that took the cike, that did! [Me]_p11918 and [my]_p11919 mate, [we]_p11920 thort [we]_p11921 wouldn't never git out quick enough. Lor', [I]_p11922 wouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark. ""  Having been in the house, [I]_p11923 could well believe [him]_p11926 but if [he]_p11927 knew what [I]_p11924 know, [he]_p11928 would, [I]_p11924 think, have raised [his]_p11929 terms. Of one thing [I]_p11930 am now satisfied: that all the boxes which arrived at [Whitby]_n1437 from Varna in the Demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of [them]_p11931 there, unless any have since been removed, as from Dr [Seward]_n's1438 diary [I]_p11932 fear. [I]_p11933 shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when Renfield attacked them.",3,,22,
stoker_dracula," By following up this clue [we]_p11934 may learn a good deal. * * * * *  Later. , Mina and [I]_p11935 have worked all day, and [we]_p11936 have put all the papers into order. Mina Harker's [Journal]_n1439 30 September. , [I]_p11937 am so glad that [I]_p11938 hardly know how to contain myself. [It]_p11939 is, [I]_p11940 suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which [I]_p11941 have had: that this terrible affair and the reopening of [his]_p11942 old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan. [I]_p11943 saw [him]_p11946 leave for Whitby with as brave a face as [I]_p11944 could, but [I]_p11944 was sick with apprehension. The effort has, however, done [him]_p11947 good. [He]_p11948 was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. [It]_p11949 is just as that [dear]_n,1440 good [Professor]_n1441 [Van Helsing]_n1442 said: [he]_p11950 is true grit, and [he]_p11951 improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature.",4,,18,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p11952 came back full of life and hope and determination [we]_p11953 have got everything in order for [to-night]_n1443. [I]_p11954 feel [myself]_p11955 quite wild with excitement. [I]_p11956 suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not human, not even beast. To read Dr [Seward]_n's1444 account of poor Lucy's death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one's heart. * * * * *  Later. , [Lord Godalming]_n1445 and [Mr Morris]_n1446 arrived earlier than [we]_p11957 expected. Dr [Seward]_n1447 was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so [I]_p11958 had to see them. [It]_p11959 was to [me]_p11960 a painful meeting, for [it]_p11961 brought back all poor [dear]_n1448 [Lucy]_n's1449 hopes of only a few months ago. Of course [they]_p11962 had heard Lucy speak of me, and [it]_p11963 seemed that Dr [Van Helsing]_n,1450 too, has been quite ""blowing [my]_p11965 trumpet,"" as Mr Morris expressed it.",8,,13,
stoker_dracula," [Poor]_n1451 fellows, neither of [them]_p11966 is aware that [I]_p11967 know all about the proposals [they]_p11968 made to Lucy. [They]_p11969 did not quite know what to say or do, as [they]_p11970 were ignorant of the amount of [my]_p11972 knowledge so [they]_p11971 had to keep on neutral subjects. However, [I]_p11973 thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing [I]_p11974 could do would be to post [them]_p11975 in affairs right up to date. [I]_p11976 knew from Dr [Seward]_n's1452 diary that [they]_p11978 had been at Lucy's death, [her]_p11979 real death, and that [I]_p11977 need not fear to betray any secret before the time. So [I]_p11980 told them, as well as [I]_p11981 could, that [I]_p11981 had read all the papers and diaries, and that [my]_p11987 husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting [them]_p11984 in order. [I]_p11988 gave [them]_p11989 each a copy to read in the library. When [Lord]_n1453 [Godalming]_n1454 got [his]_p11990 and turned [it]_p11991 over, [it]_p11992 does make a pretty good pile, [he]_p11994 said:, ""Did [you]_p11996 write all this, Mrs Harker?"" [I]_p11999 nodded, and [he]_p11995 went on:, ""I don't quite see the drift of [it]_p11992 but [you]_p11997 people are all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all [I]_p12000 can do is to accept [your]_p12002 ideas blindfold and try to help you. [I]_p12003 have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of [his]_p12004 life. Besides, [I]_p12005 know [you]_p12006 loved [my]_p12007 [poor Lucy]_n,1455 "" Here [he]_p12008 turned away and covered [his]_p12009 face with [his]_p12010 hands. [I]_p12011 could hear the tears in [his]_p12012 voice.",5,,42,
stoker_dracula," Mr Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on [his]_p12013 shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room. [I]_p12014 suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man free to break down before [her]_p12015 and express [his]_p12016 feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling [it]_p12018 derogatory to [his]_p12017 manhood for when [Lord]_n1456 [Godalming]_n1457 found [himself]_p12019 alone with [me]_p12020 [he]_p12021 sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. [I]_p12022 sat down beside [him]_p12023 and took [his]_p12024 hand. [I]_p12025 hope [he]_p12026 didn't think [it]_p12029 forward of me, and that if [he]_p12027 ever thinks of [it]_p12030 afterwards [he]_p12027 never will have such a thought. There [I]_p12031 wrong [him]_p12033 [I]_p12032 know [he]_p12034 never will, [he]_p12035 is too true a gentleman. [I]_p12036 said to him, for [I]_p12037 could see that [his]_p12040 heart was breaking:, ""I loved [dear]_n1458 [Lucy]_n,1459 and [I]_p12037 know what [she]_p12041 was to you, and what [you]_p12042 were to her. [She]_p12044 and [I]_p12045 were like sisters and now [she]_p12048 is gone, will [you]_p12049 not let [me]_p12052 be like a sister to [you]_p12050 in [your]_p12053 trouble? [I]_p12046 know what sorrows [you]_p12050 have had, though [I]_p12046 cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can help in [your]_p12054 affliction, won't [you]_p12055 let [me]_p12056 be of some little service, for [Lucy]_n's1460 sake?"" In an instant the poor [dear]_n1461 fellow was overwhelmed with grief. [It]_p12057 seemed to [me]_p12058 that all that [he]_p12059 had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once. [He]_p12060 grew quite hysterical, and raising [his]_p12061 open hands, beat [his]_p12062 palms together in a perfect agony of grief.",6,,48,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p12063 stood up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down [his]_p12064 cheeks. [I]_p12065 felt an infinite pity for him, and opened [my]_p12066 arms unthinkingly. With a sob [he]_p12067 laid [his]_p12069 head on [my]_p12070 shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst [he]_p12068 shook with emotion. [We]_p12071 women have something of the mother in [us]_p12072 that makes [us]_p12073 rise above smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked [I]_p12074 felt this big sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though [it]_p12076 were that of the baby that some day may lie on [my]_p12077 bosom, and [I]_p12075 stroked [his]_p12079 hair as though [he]_p12080 were [my]_p12078 own child. [I]_p12081 never thought at the time how strange [it]_p12082 all was. After a little bit [his]_p12083 sobs ceased, and [he]_p12085 raised [himself]_p12087 with an apology, though [he]_p12086 made no disguise of [his]_p12084 emotion. [He]_p12088 told [me]_p12089 that for days and nights past, weary days and sleepless nights, [he]_p12090 had been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in [his]_p12091 time of sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which [his]_p12092 sorrow was surrounded, [he]_p12093 could speak freely. ""I know now how [I]_p12094 suffered,"" [he]_p12097 said, as [he]_p12098 dried [his]_p12099 eyes, ""but [I]_p12095 do not know even yet, and none other can ever know, how much [your]_p12100 sweet sympathy has been to [me]_p12101 to-day. [I]_p12102 shall know better in time and believe [me]_p12104 that, though [I]_p12103 am not ungrateful now, [my]_p12105 gratitude will grow with [my]_p12106 understanding.",0,,43,
stoker_dracula," [You]_p12107 will let [me]_p12108 be like a brother, will [you]_p12109 not, for all [our]_p12110 lives, for [dear]_n1462 [Lucy]_n's1463 sake?"" ""For [dear]_n1464 [Lucy]_n's1465 sake,"" [I]_p12111 said as [we]_p12112 clasped hands. ""Ay, and for [your]_p12113 own sake,"" [he]_p12114 added, ""for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning, [you]_p12115 have won [mine]_p12116 to-day. If ever the future should bring to [you]_p12117 a time when [you]_p12118 need a man's help, believe me, [you]_p12118 will not call in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to [you]_p12120 to break the sunshine of [your]_p12122 life but if [it]_p12123 should ever come, promise [me]_p12124 that [you]_p12121 will let [me]_p12125 know. "" [He]_p12126 was so earnest, and [his]_p12127 sorrow was so fresh, that [I]_p12128 felt [it]_p12131 would comfort him, so [I]_p12129 said:,   ""I promise. "" As [I]_p12132 came along the corridor [I]_p12133 saw [Mr Morris]_n1466 looking out of a window. [He]_p12134 turned as [he]_p12135 heard [my]_p12136 footsteps. ""How is [Art]_n?""1467 [he]_p12137 said. Then noticing [my]_p12138 red eyes, [he]_p12139 went on: ""Ah, [I]_p12140 see [you]_p12141 have been comforting him. [Poor]_n1468 old fellow! [he]_p12142 needs it.",7,,35,
stoker_dracula," No one but a woman can help a man when [he]_p12143 is in trouble of the heart and [he]_p12144 had no one to comfort him. ""  [He]_p12145 bore [his]_p12146 own trouble so bravely that [my]_p12147 heart bled for him. [I]_p12148 saw the manuscript in [his]_p12154 hand, and [I]_p12149 knew that when [he]_p12155 read [it]_p12157 [he]_p12156 would realise how much [I]_p12149 knew so [I]_p12150 said to him:,   ""I wish [I]_p12150 could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will [you]_p12158 let [me]_p12161 be [your]_p12163 friend, and will [you]_p12159 come to [me]_p12162 for comfort if [you]_p12159 need it? [You]_p12164 will know, later on, why [I]_p12165 speak. "" [He]_p12166 saw that [I]_p12167 was in earnest, and stooping, took [my]_p12168 hand, and raising [it]_p12169 to [his]_p12171 lips, kissed it. [It]_p12172 seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively [I]_p12173 bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in [his]_p12174 eyes, and there was a momentary choking in [his]_p12175 throat [he]_p12177 said quite calmly:,   ""Little girl, [you]_p12179 will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long as ever [you]_p12180 live!"" Then [he]_p12178 went into the study to [his]_p12175 friend. ""Little girl!"", the very words [he]_p12181 had used to Lucy, and oh, but [he]_p12182 proved [himself]_p12183 a friend!     CHAPTER XVIII  DR. SEWARD'S [DIARY]_n1469 30 September. , [I]_p12184 got home at five o'clock, and found that [Godalming]_n1470 and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which Harker and [his]_p12185 wonderful wife had made and arranged.",2,,41,
stoker_dracula," Harker had not yet returned from [his]_p12186 visit to the carriers' men, of whom [Dr Hennessey]_n1471 had written to me. [Mrs Harker]_n1472 gave [us]_p12187 a cup of tea, and [I]_p12188 can honestly say that, for the first time since [I]_p12189 have lived in it, this old house seemed like home. When [we]_p12190 had finished, Mrs Harker said:, ""Dr [Seward]_n,1473 may [I]_p12191 ask a favour? [I]_p12192 want to see [your]_p12193 patient, [Mr Renfield]_n1474. Do let [me]_p12194 see him. What [you]_p12195 have said of [him]_p12196 in [your]_p12197 diary interests [me]_p12198 so much!"" [She]_p12200 looked so appealing and so pretty that [I]_p12201 could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why [I]_p12202 should so [I]_p12202 took [her]_p12204 with me. When [I]_p12206 went into the room, [I]_p12207 told the man that a lady would like to see [him]_p12209 to which [he]_p12210 simply answered: ""Why?""  ""She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,"" [I]_p12207 answered. ""Oh, very well,"" [he]_p12211 said ""let [her]_p12212 come in, by all means but just wait a minute till [I]_p12213 tidy up the place. "" [His]_p12214 method of tidying was peculiar: [he]_p12215 simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before [I]_p12216 could stop him. [It]_p12217 was quite evident that [he]_p12218 feared, or was jealous of, some interference. When [he]_p12219 had got through [his]_p12222 disgusting task, [he]_p12220 said cheerfully: ""Let the lady come in,"" and sat down on the edge of [his]_p12223 bed with [his]_p12223 head down, but with [his]_p12224 eyelids raised so that [he]_p12220 could see [her]_p12226 as [she]_p12227 entered.",4,,40,
stoker_dracula," For a moment [I]_p12228 thought that [he]_p12232 might have some homicidal intent [I]_p12229 remembered how quiet [he]_p12233 had been just before [he]_p12233 attacked [me]_p12236 in [my]_p12237 own study, and [I]_p12229 took care to stand where [I]_p12230 could seize [him]_p12238 at once if [he]_p12234 attempted to make a spring at her. [She]_p12239 came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic, for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect. [She]_p12240 walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out [her]_p12241 hand. ""[Good-evening]_n,1475 [Mr Renfield]_n,""1476 said she. ""You see, [I]_p12242 know you, for [Dr Seward]_n1477 has told [me]_p12243 of you. "" [He]_p12244 made no immediate reply, but eyed [her]_p12245 all over intently with a set frown on [his]_p12246 face. This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt then, to [my]_p12247 intense astonishment, [he]_p12248 said:,   ""You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? [You]_p12249 can't be, [you]_p12251 know, for she's dead. "" [Mrs Harker]_n1478 smiled sweetly as [she]_p12253 replied:, ""Oh no! [I]_p12254 have a husband of [my]_p12257 own, to whom [I]_p12255 was married before [I]_p12255 ever saw [Dr Seward]_n,1479 or [he]_p12258 me. [I]_p12259 am [Mrs Harker]_n1480. "" ""Then what are [you]_p12260 doing here?"" ""My husband and [I]_p12261 are staying on a visit with Dr [Seward]_n1481.",7,,32,
stoker_dracula," ""  ""Then don't stay. "" ""But why not?"" [I]_p12262 thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs Harker, any more than [it]_p12266 was to me, so [I]_p12263 joined in:, ""How did [you]_p12267 know [I]_p12263 wanted to marry any one?"" [His]_p12268 reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which [he]_p12269 turned [his]_p12270 eyes from Mrs Harker to me, instantly turning [them]_p12271 back again:, ""What an asinine question!"" ""I don't see that at all, [Mr Renfield]_n,""1482 said Mrs Harker, at once championing me. [He]_p12272 replied to [her]_p12273 with as much courtesy and respect as [he]_p12274 had shown contempt to me:,   ""You will, of course, understand, Mrs Harker, that when a man is so loved and honoured as [our]_p12275 host is, everything regarding [him]_p12277 is of interest in [our]_p12276 little community. Dr Seward is loved not only by [his]_p12278 household and [his]_p12279 friends, but even by [his]_p12279 patients, who, being some of [them]_p12281 hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects. Since [I]_p12282 [myself]_p12284 have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, [I]_p12283 cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of [its]_p12285 inmates lean towards the errors of [non]_p12286 causa and ignoratio elenchi. "" [I]_p12287 positively opened [my]_p12288 eyes at this new development. Here was [my]_p12289 own pet lunatic, the most pronounced of [his]_p12290 type that [I]_p12291 had ever met with, talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman. [I]_p12292 wonder if [it]_p12293 was Mrs Harker's presence which had touched some chord in [his]_p12294 memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to [her]_p12295 unconscious influence, [she]_p12296 must have some rare gift or power. [We]_p12297 continued to talk for some time and, seeing that [he]_p12298 was seemingly quite reasonable, [she]_p12299 ventured, looking at [me]_p12301 questioningly as [she]_p12300 began, to lead [him]_p12302 to [his]_p12303 favourite topic.",1,,41,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p12304 was again astonished, for [he]_p12305 addressed [himself]_p12308 to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity [he]_p12306 even took [himself]_p12309 as an example when [he]_p12306 mentioned certain things. ""Why, [I]_p12310 [myself]_p12311 am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed, [it]_p12312 was no wonder that [my]_p12313 friends were alarmed, and insisted on [my]_p12314 being put under control. [I]_p12315 used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, [one]_p12316 might indefinitely prolong life. At times [I]_p12317 held the belief so strongly that [I]_p12318 actually tried to take human life. The doctor here will bear [me]_p12319 out that on one occasion [I]_p12320 tried to kill [him]_p12321 for the purpose of strengthening [my]_p12322 vital powers by the assimilation with [my]_p12323 own body of [his]_p12324 life through the medium of [his]_p12325 blood, relying, of course, upon the [Scriptural]_n1483 phrase, 'For the blood is the life. ' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true, doctor?"" [I]_p12326 nodded assent, for [I]_p12327 was so amazed that [I]_p12327 hardly knew what to either think or say [it]_p12330 was hard to imagine that [I]_p12328 had seen [him]_p12331 eat up [his]_p12332 spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at [my]_p12333 watch, [I]_p12334 saw that [I]_p12335 should go to the station to meet [Van Helsing]_n,1484 so [I]_p12335 told [Mrs Harker]_n1485 that [it]_p12337 was time to leave. [She]_p12338 came at once, after saying pleasantly to [Mr Renfield]_n:1486 ""Good-bye, and [I]_p12339 hope [I]_p12340 may see [you]_p12341 often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself,"" to which, to [my]_p12342 astonishment, [he]_p12344 replied:, ""Good-bye, [my]_p12343 [dear]_n1487.",5,,41,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p12345 pray God [I]_p12346 may never see [your]_p12347 sweet face again. May [He]_p12348 bless and keep you!"" When [I]_p12349 went to the station to meet [Van Helsing]_n1488 [I]_p12350 left the boys behind me. [Poor]_n1489 Art seemed more cheerful than [he]_p12351 has been since Lucy first took ill, and [Quincey]_n1490 is more like [his]_p12353 own bright self than [he]_p12352 has been for many a long day. [Van Helsing]_n1491 stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy. [He]_p12354 saw [me]_p12355 at once, and rushed up to me, saying:,   ""Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! [I]_p12357 have been busy, for [I]_p12358 come here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and [I]_p12359 have much to tell. [Madam Mina]_n1492 is with you? Yes. And [her]_p12360 so fine husband? And [Arthur]_n1493 and [my]_p12361 friend [Quincey]_n,1494 [they]_p12363 are with you, too? Good!"" As [I]_p12364 drove to the house [I]_p12365 told [him]_p12366 of what had passed, and of how [my]_p12362 own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs Harker's suggestion at which the [Professor]_n1495 interrupted me:, ""Ah, that wonderful [Madam]_n1496 Mina! [She]_p12367 has man's brain, a brain that a man should have were [he]_p12368 much gifted, and a woman's heart. The good God fashioned [her]_p12369 for a purpose, believe me, when [He]_p12370 made that so good combination. [Friend John]_n,1497 up to now fortune has made that woman of help to [us]_p12371 after [to-night]_n1498 [she]_p12372 must not have to do with this so terrible affair.",11,,27,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p12373 is not good that [she]_p12374 run a risk so great. [We]_p12375 men are determined, nay, are [we]_p12376 not pledged?, to destroy this monster but [it]_p12377 is no part for a woman. Even if [she]_p12378 be not harmed, [her]_p12380 heart may fail [her]_p12381 in so much and so many horrors and hereafter [she]_p12379 may suffer, both in waking, from [her]_p12381 nerves, and in sleep, from [her]_p12382 dreams. And, besides, [she]_p12384 is [young]_n1499 woman and not so long married there may be other things to think of some time, if not now. [You]_p12385 tell [me]_p12386 [she]_p12387 has wrote all, then [she]_p12388 must consult with [us]_p12390 but to-morrow [she]_p12388 say good-bye to this work, and [we]_p12391 go alone. "" [I]_p12392 agreed heartily with him, and then [I]_p12393 told [him]_p12394 what [we]_p12396 had found in [his]_p12397 absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to [my]_p12398 own. [He]_p12399 was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him. ""Oh that [we]_p12400 had known [it]_p12402 before!"" [he]_p12403 said, ""for then [we]_p12401 might have reached [him]_p12404 in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as [you]_p12405 say. [We]_p12406 shall not think of that, but go on [our]_p12407 way to the end.",1,,34,
stoker_dracula," "" Then [he]_p12408 fell into a silence that lasted till [we]_p12409 entered [my]_p12410 own gateway. Before [we]_p12411 went to prepare for dinner [he]_p12412 said to Mrs Harker:, ""I am told, [Madam]_n1500 Mina, by [my]_p12413 friend John that [you]_p12414 and [your]_p12415 husband have put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.

Must [it]_p12428 go in?"" The [Professor]_n1505 read [it]_p12429 over gravely, and handed [it]_p12429 back, saying:, ""It need not go in if [you]_p12433 do not wish [it]_p12430 but [I]_p12434 pray that [it]_p12430 may.

stoker_dracula," "" [She]_p12440 took [it]_p12441 back with another blush and a bright smile. And so now, up to this very hour, all the records [we]_p12442 have are complete and in order. The [Professor]_n1506 took away one copy to study after dinner, and before [our]_p12443 meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of [us]_p12444 have already read everything so when [we]_p12445 meet in the study [we]_p12446 shall all be informed as to facts, and can arrange [our]_p12447 plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy.

[Professor]_n1509 [Van Helsing]_n1510 took the head of the table, to which Dr [Seward]_n1511 motioned [him]_p12450 as [he]_p12451 came into the room. [He]_p12452 made [me]_p12453 sit next to [him]_p12456 on [his]_p12457 right, and asked [me]_p12454 to act as secretary Jonathan sat next to me. Opposite [us]_p12458 were [Lord]_n1512 [Godalming]_n,1513 Dr Seward, and Mr Morris, [Lord]_n1514 [Godalming]_n1515 being next the [[Professor]_n]_n,1516 and Dr Seward in the centre.",12,,18,

[I]_p12470 shall then make known to [you]_p12471 something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me. So [we]_p12472 then can discuss how [we]_p12473 shall act, and can take [our]_p12474 measure according. ""There are such beings as vampires some of [us]_p12475 have evidence that [they]_p12476 exist. Even had [we]_p12477 not the proof of [our]_p12478 own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples.

The nosferatu do not die like the bee when [he]_p12494 sting once. [He]_p12495 is only stronger and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst [us]_p12496 is of [himself]_p12497 so strong in person as twenty men [he]_p12498 is of cunning more than mortal, for [his]_p12508 cunning be the growth of ages [he]_p12499 have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as [his]_p12509 etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that [he]_p12499 can come nigh to are for [him]_p12511 at command [he]_p12500 is brute, and more than brute [he]_p12500 is devil in callous, and the heart of [him]_p12512 is not [he]_p12500 can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to [him]_p12512 [he]_p12501 can, within [his]_p12509 range, direct the elements the storm, the fog, the thunder [he]_p12501 can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat, the moth, and the fox, and the wolf [he]_p12501 can grow and become small and [he]_p12501 can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are [we]_p12514 to begin [our]_p12518 strike to destroy him? How shall [we]_p12515 find [his]_p12519 where and having found it, how can [we]_p12515 destroy? [My]_p12522 friends, this is much [it]_p12520 is a terrible task that [we]_p12516 undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder.

To [us]_p12535 for ever are the gates of heaven shut for who shall open [them]_p12537 to [us]_p12536 again?

Whilst [he]_p12549 was speaking, Jonathan had taken [my]_p12550 hand. [I]_p12551 feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of [our]_p12553 danger was overcoming [him]_p12554 when [I]_p12552 saw [his]_p12555 hand stretch out but [it]_p12556 was life to [me]_p12557 to feel [its]_p12558 touch, so strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for [itself]_p12559 [it]_p12560 does not even need a woman's love to hear [its]_p12561 music.

""I answer for [Mina]_n1523 and myself,"" [he]_p12566 said. ""Count [me]_p12567 in, Professor,"" said [Mr Quincey Morris]_n,1524 laconically as usual.

So as [we]_p12575 all took hands [our]_p12576 solemn compact was made. [I]_p12577 felt [my]_p12578 heart icy cold, but [it]_p12579 did not even occur to [me]_p12580 to draw back. [We]_p12581 resumed [our]_p12582 places, and Dr [Van Helsing]_n1531 went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun. [It]_p12583 was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life:,   ""Well, [you]_p12584 know what [we]_p12585 have to contend against but we, too, are not without strength. [We]_p12587 have on [our]_p12588 side power of combination, a power denied to the vampire kind [we]_p12589 have sources of science [we]_p12590 are free to act and think and the hours of the day and the night are [ours]_p12591 equally. In fact, so far as [our]_p12592 powers extend, [they]_p12593 are unfettered, and [we]_p12594 are free to use them. [We]_p12595 have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.",4,,27,
stoker_dracula," ""Now let [us]_p12596 see how far the general powers arrayed against [us]_p12597 are restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let [us]_p12598 consider the limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular. ""All [we]_p12599 have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death, nay of more than either life or death. Yet must [we]_p12600 be satisfied in the first place because [we]_p12601 have to be, no other means is at [our]_p12602 control, and secondly, because, after all, these things, tradition and superstition, are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for others, though not, alas! for us, on them? A year ago which of [us]_p12603 would have received such a possibility, in the midst of [our]_p12605 scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? [We]_p12607 even scouted a belief that [we]_p12608 saw justified under [our]_p12606 very eyes. Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in [his]_p12609 limitations and [his]_p12610 cure, rest for the moment on the same base. For, let [me]_p12611 tell you, [he]_p12612 is known everywhere that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome [he]_p12613 flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese and in China, so far from [us]_p12615 in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear [him]_p12616 at this day.

stoker_dracula," So far, then, [we]_p12618 have all [we]_p12619 may act upon and let [me]_p12621 tell [you]_p12622 that very much of the beliefs are justified by what [we]_p12619 have seen in [our]_p12623 own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time [he]_p12624 can flourish when that [he]_p12625 can fatten on the blood of the living. Even more, [we]_p12626 have seen amongst [us]_p12627 that [he]_p12628 can even grow younger that [his]_p12629 vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though [they]_p12631 refresh [themselves]_p12632 when [his]_p12630 special pabulum is plenty. But [he]_p12633 cannot flourish without this diet [he]_p12634 eat not as others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with [him]_p12635 for weeks, did never see [him]_p12636 to eat, never! [He]_p12637 throws no shadow [he]_p12638 make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe. [He]_p12639 has the strength of many of [his]_p12640 hand, witness again Jonathan when [he]_p12641 shut the door against the wolfs, and when [he]_p12642 help [him]_p12643 from the diligence too. [He]_p12644 can transform [himself]_p12645 to wolf, as [we]_p12646 gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when [he]_p12647 tear open the dog [he]_p12648 can be as bat, as [Madam]_n1533 Mina saw [him]_p12649 on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw [him]_p12650 fly from this so near house, and as [my]_p12652 friend [Quincey]_n1534 saw [him]_p12650 at the window of Miss Lucy. [He]_p12653 can come in mist which [he]_p12654 create, that noble ship's captain proved [him]_p12656 of this but, from what [we]_p12657 know, the distance [he]_p12655 can make this mist is limited, and [it]_p12658 can only be round himself. [He]_p12659 come on moonlight rays as elemental dust, as again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula. [He]_p12660 become so small, [we]_p12661 [ourselves]_p12662 saw [Miss Lucy]_n,1535 ere [she]_p12663 was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door.",3,,46,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p12664 can, when once [he]_p12665 find [his]_p12666 way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close [it]_p12667 be bound or even fused up with fire, solder [you]_p12669 call it. [He]_p12670 can see in the dark, no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear [me]_p12671 through. [He]_p12672 can do all these things, yet [he]_p12673 is not free. Nay [he]_p12674 is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in [his]_p12675 cell. [He]_p12676 cannot go where [he]_p12677 lists [he]_p12678 who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature's laws, why [we]_p12679 know not. [He]_p12680 may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid [him]_p12681 to come  though afterwards [he]_p12682 can come as [he]_p12683 please. [His]_p12684 power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times can [he]_p12685 have limited freedom. If [he]_p12686 be not at the place whither [he]_p12687 is bound, [he]_p12687 can only change [himself]_p12689 at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.",0,,25,
stoker_dracula," These things are [we]_p12690 told, and in this record of ours [we]_p12691 have proof by inference. Thus, whereas [he]_p12692 can do as [he]_p12693 will within [his]_p12697 limit, when [he]_p12693 have [his]_p12698 earth-home, [his]_p12698 coffin-home, [his]_p12699 hell-home, the place unhallowed, as [we]_p12701 saw when [he]_p12694 went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby still at other time [he]_p12694 can only change when the time come. [It]_p12702 is said, too, that [he]_p12703 can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict [him]_p12704 that [he]_p12705 has no power, as the garlic that [we]_p12708 know of and as for things sacred, as this symbol, [my]_p12710 crucifix, that was amongst [us]_p12711 even now when [we]_p12709 resolve, to [them]_p12712 [he]_p12706 is nothing, but in [their]_p12713 presence [he]_p12706 take [his]_p12714 place far off and silent with respect. There are others, too, which [I]_p12715 shall tell [you]_p12716 of, lest in [our]_p12717 seeking [we]_p12718 may need them. The branch of wild rose on [his]_p12719 coffin keep [him]_p12720 that [he]_p12723 move not from [it]_p12725 a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill [him]_p12721 so that [he]_p12724 be true dead and as for the stake through him, [we]_p12726 know already of [its]_p12727 peace or the cut-off head that giveth rest. [We]_p12728 have seen [it]_p12729 with [our]_p12730 eyes. ""Thus when [we]_p12731 find the habitation of this man-that-was, [we]_p12732 can confine [him]_p12735 to [his]_p12737 coffin and destroy him, if [we]_p12732 obey what [we]_p12733 know. But [he]_p12738 is clever. [I]_p12739 have asked [my]_p12740 friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make [his]_p12741 record and, from all the means that are, [he]_p12742 tell [me]_p12744 of what [he]_p12743 has been.",0,,53,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p12745 must, indeed, have been that [Voivode]_n1536 Dracula who won [his]_p12746 name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of [Turkey]_n-land1537. If [it]_p12747 be so, then was [he]_p12748 no common man for in that time, and for centuries after, [he]_p12749 was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the forest. ' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with [him]_p12750 to [his]_p12751 grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by [their]_p12752 coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. [They]_p12753 learned [his]_p12754 secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as [his]_p12755 due. In the records are such words as 'stregoica', witch, 'ordog,' and 'pokol', Satan and hell and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as 'wampyr,' which [we]_p12756 all understand too well. There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and [their]_p12757 graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For [it]_p12758 is not the least of [its]_p12760 terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good in soil barren of holy memories [it]_p12759 cannot rest. ""  Whilst [they]_p12761 were talking Mr Morris was looking steadily at the window, and [he]_p12762 now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little pause, and then the [Professor]_n1538 went on:, ""And now [we]_p12763 must settle what [we]_p12764 do.",3,,20,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p12765 have here much data, and [we]_p12766 must proceed to lay out [our]_p12767 campaign. [We]_p12768 know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax [we]_p12769 also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed. [It]_p12770 seems to me, that [our]_p12771 first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where [we]_p12772 look to-day or whether any more have been removed. If the latter, [we]_p12773 must trace, , ""  Here [we]_p12774 were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came the sound of a pistol-shot the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the room. [I]_p12775 am afraid [I]_p12776 am at heart a coward, for [I]_p12776 shrieked out. The men all jumped to [their]_p12778 feet [Lord]_n1539 [Godalming]_n1540 flew over to the window and threw up the sash. As [he]_p12779 did so [we]_p12780 heard [Mr Morris]_n's1541 voice without:, ""Sorry! [I]_p12781 fear [I]_p12782 have alarmed you. [I]_p12783 shall come in and tell [you]_p12784 about it. "" A minute later [he]_p12785 came in and said:,   ""It was an idiotic thing of [me]_p12786 to do, and [I]_p12787 ask [your]_p12790 pardon, Mrs Harker, most sincerely [I]_p12788 fear [I]_p12788 must have frightened [you]_p12791 terribly.",3,,27,
stoker_dracula," But the fact is that whilst the [Professor]_n1542 was talking there came a big bat and sat on the window-sill. [I]_p12792 have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that [I]_p12793 cannot stand them, and [I]_p12793 went out to have a shot, as [I]_p12794 have been doing of late of evenings, whenever [I]_p12794 have seen one. [You]_p12797 used to laugh at [me]_p12798 for [it]_p12799 then, Art. "" ""Did [you]_p12800 hit it?"" asked [Dr Van Helsing]_n1543. ""I don't know [I]_p12801 fancy not, for [it]_p12803 flew away into the wood. "" Without saying any more [he]_p12804 took [his]_p12806 seat, and the [Professor]_n1544 began to resume [his]_p12807 statement:, ""We must trace each of these boxes and when [we]_p12809 are ready, [we]_p12810 must either capture or kill this monster in [his]_p12807 lair or [we]_p12810 must, so to speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more [he]_p12805 can seek safety in it. Thus in the end [we]_p12812 may find [him]_p12813 in [his]_p12815 form of man between the hours of noon and sunset, and so engage with [him]_p12814 when [he]_p12817 is at [his]_p12816 most weak. ""And now for you, [Madam]_n1545 Mina, this night is the end until all be well. [You]_p12818 are too precious to [us]_p12819 to have such risk.

""  All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved but [it]_p12831 did not seem to [me]_p12833 good that [they]_p12837 should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen [their]_p12838 safety, strength being the best safety, through care of [me]_p12834 but [their]_p12839 minds were made up, and, though [it]_p12832 was a bitter pill for [me]_p12834 to swallow, [I]_p12841 could say nothing, save to accept [their]_p12839 chivalrous care of me. [Mr Morris]_n1547 resumed the discussion:, ""As there is no time to lose, [I]_p12842 vote [we]_p12843 have a look at [his]_p12844 house right now. Time is everything with [him]_p12845 and swift action on [our]_p12846 part may save another victim. ""  [I]_p12847 own that [my]_p12851 heart began to fail [me]_p12852 when the time for action came so close, but [I]_p12848 did not say anything, for [I]_p12848 had a greater fear that if [I]_p12849 appeared as a drag or a hindrance to [their]_p12854 work, [they]_p12856 might even leave [me]_p12853 out of [their]_p12855 counsels altogether. [They]_p12857 have now gone off to Carfax, with means to get into the house. Manlike, [they]_p12858 had told [me]_p12859 to go to bed and sleep as if a woman can sleep when those [she]_p12861 loves are in danger! [I]_p12862 shall lie down and pretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about [me]_p12860 when [he]_p12863 returns. [Dr Seward]_n's1548 [Diary]_n1549. 1 October, 4 a.",3,,41,
stoker_dracula," m. , Just as [we]_p12864 were about to leave the house, an urgent message was brought to [me]_p12865 from Renfield to know if [I]_p12867 would see [him]_p12868 at once, as [he]_p12869 had something of the utmost importance to say to me. [I]_p12870 told the messenger to say that [I]_p12871 would attend to [his]_p12873 wishes in the morning [I]_p12871 was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:,   ""He seems very importunate, sir. [I]_p12874 have never seen [him]_p12875 so eager. [I]_p12876 don't know but what, if [you]_p12877 don't see [him]_p12878 soon, [he]_p12879 will have one of [his]_p12880 violent fits. "" [I]_p12881 knew the man would not have said this without some cause, so [I]_p12882 said: ""All right I'll go now"" and [I]_p12882 asked the others to wait a few minutes for me, as [I]_p12883 had to go and see [my]_p12886 ""patient. "" ""Take [me]_p12887 with you, friend John,"" said the [Professor]_n1550. ""His case in [your]_p12888 diary interest [me]_p12889 much, and [it]_p12890 had bearing, too, now and again on [our]_p12891 case. [I]_p12892 should much like to see him, and especial when [his]_p12893 mind is disturbed.",1,,28,
stoker_dracula," "" ""May [I]_p12894 come also?"" asked [Lord Godalming]_n1551. ""Me too?"" said [Quincey Morris]_n1552. ""May [I]_p12895 come?"" said Harker. [I]_p12896 nodded, and [we]_p12897 all went down the passage together. [We]_p12898 found [him]_p12899 in a state of considerable excitement, but far more rational in [his]_p12901 speech and manner than [I]_p12902 had ever seen him. There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything [I]_p12903 had ever met with in a lunatic and [he]_p12904 took [it]_p12905 for granted that [his]_p12906 reasons would prevail with others entirely sane. [We]_p12907 all four went into the room, but none of the others at first said anything. [His]_p12908 request was that [I]_p12909 would at once release [him]_p12910 from the asylum and send [him]_p12911 home. This [he]_p12912 backed up with arguments regarding [his]_p12913 complete recovery, and adduced [his]_p12914 own existing sanity. ""I appeal to [your]_p12915 friends,"" [he]_p12916 said, ""they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on [my]_p12917 case.",2,,23,
stoker_dracula," By the way, [you]_p12918 have not introduced me. "" [I]_p12919 was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike [me]_p12921 at the moment and, besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of the habit of equality, that [I]_p12920 at once made the introduction: ""[Lord]_n1553 [Godalming]_n1554 [Professor]_n1555 [Van Helsing]_n1556 [Mr Quincey Morris]_n,1557 of [Texas Mr Renfield]_n1558. "" [He]_p12922 shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:, ""[Lord Godalming]_n,1559 [I]_p12923 had the honour of seconding [your]_p12925 father at the Windham [I]_p12924 grieve to know, by [your]_p12926 holding the title, that [he]_p12927 is no more. [He]_p12928 was a man loved and honoured by all who knew [him]_p12929 and in [his]_p12930 youth was, [I]_p12931 have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much patronised on Derby night. [Mr Morris]_n,1560 [you]_p12932 should be proud of [your]_p12933 great state. [Its]_p12934 reception into the Union was a precedent which may have far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes [its]_p12935 true place as a political fable. What shall any man say of [his]_p12936 pleasure at meeting [Van Helsing]_n?1561 Sir, [I]_p12937 make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by [his]_p12938 discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since [they]_p12939 would seem to limit [him]_p12940 to one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold [your]_p12941 respective places in the moving world, [I]_p12942 take to witness that [I]_p12943 am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of [their]_p12944 liberties.",9,,27,
stoker_dracula," And [I]_p12945 am sure that you, Dr [Seward]_n,1562 humanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem [it]_p12946 a moral duty to deal with [me]_p12947 as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances. "" [He]_p12948 made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without [its]_p12949 own charm. [I]_p12950 think [we]_p12951 were all staggered. For [my]_p12952 own part, [I]_p12954 was under the conviction, despite [my]_p12953 knowledge of the man's character and history, that [his]_p12957 reason had been restored and [I]_p12955 felt under a strong impulse to tell [him]_p12960 that [I]_p12955 was satisfied as to [his]_p12958 sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for [his]_p12958 release in the morning. [I]_p12961 thought [it]_p12963 better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old [I]_p12962 knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable. So [I]_p12964 contented [myself]_p12967 with making a general statement that [he]_p12968 appeared to be improving very rapidly that [I]_p12965 would have a longer chat with [him]_p12969 in the morning, and would then see what [I]_p12965 could do in the direction of meeting [his]_p12970 wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for [he]_p12971 said quickly:, ""But [I]_p12972 fear, Dr [Seward]_n,1563 that [you]_p12973 hardly apprehend [my]_p12974 wish. [I]_p12975 desire to go at once, here, now, this very hour, this very moment, if [I]_p12976 may. Time presses, and in [our]_p12977 implied agreement with the old scytheman [it]_p12978 is of the essence of the contract. [I]_p12979 am sure [it]_p12980 is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr [Seward]_n1564 so simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure [its]_p12981 fulfilment.",3,,37,
stoker_dracula," "" [He]_p12982 looked at [me]_p12983 keenly, and seeing the negative in [my]_p12984 face, turned to the others, and scrutinised [them]_p12985 closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, [he]_p12986 went on:,   ""Is [it]_p12987 possible that [I]_p12988 have erred in [my]_p12991 supposition?""  ""You have,"" [I]_p12989 said frankly, but at the same time, as [I]_p12989 felt, brutally. There was a considerable pause, and then [he]_p12992 said slowly:,   ""Then [I]_p12993 suppose [I]_p12994 must only shift [my]_p12995 ground of request. Let [me]_p12996 ask for this concession, boon, privilege, what [you]_p12997 will. [I]_p12998 am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. [I]_p12999 am not at liberty to give [you]_p13001 the whole of [my]_p13004 reasons but [you]_p13002 may, [I]_p13000 assure you, take [it]_p13005 from [me]_p13006 that [they]_p13007 are good ones, sound and unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could [you]_p13008 look, sir, into [my]_p13010 heart, [you]_p13009 would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me. Nay, more, [you]_p13011 would count [me]_p13012 amongst the best and truest of [your]_p13013 friends. "" Again [he]_p13014 looked at [us]_p13015 all keenly. [I]_p13016 had a growing conviction that this sudden change of [his]_p13017 entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of [his]_p13018 madness, and so determined to let [him]_p13019 go on a little longer, knowing from experience that [he]_p13020 would, like all lunatics, give [himself]_p13021 away in the end.",0,,39,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n1565 was gazing at [him]_p13022 with a look of utmost intensity, [his]_p13023 bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of [his]_p13024 look. [He]_p13025 said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise [me]_p13026 at the time, but only when [I]_p13028 thought of [it]_p13030 afterwards, for [it]_p13031 was as of one addressing an equal:, ""Can [you]_p13032 not tell frankly [your]_p13036 real reason for wishing to be free [to-night]_n?1566 [I]_p13029 will undertake that if [you]_p13033 will satisfy even me, a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind, Dr [Seward]_n1567 will give you, at [his]_p13037 own risk and on [his]_p13038 own responsibility, the privilege [you]_p13033 seek. "" [He]_p13039 shook [his]_p13040 head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on [his]_p13041 face. The Professor went on:,   ""Come, sir, bethink yourself. [You]_p13042 claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree, since [you]_p13043 seek to impress [us]_p13044 with [your]_p13045 complete reasonableness. [You]_p13046 do this, whose sanity [we]_p13047 have reason to doubt, since [you]_p13048 are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If [you]_p13049 will not help [us]_p13052 in [our]_p13055 effort to choose the wisest course, how can [we]_p13056 perform the duty which [you]_p13050 [yourself]_p13059 put upon us? Be wise, and help [us]_p13053 and if [we]_p13057 can [we]_p13057 shall aid [you]_p13050 to achieve [your]_p13060 wish.

[I]_p13070 can only ask [you]_p13071 to trust me.",4,,47,
stoker_dracula," If [I]_p13072 am refused, the responsibility does not rest with me. "" [I]_p13073 thought [it]_p13075 was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so [I]_p13074 went towards the door, simply saying:,   ""Come, [my]_p13076 friends, [we]_p13077 have work to do. [Good-night]_n1569. ""  As, however, [I]_p13078 got near the door, a new change came over the patient. [He]_p13079 moved towards [me]_p13080 so quickly that for the moment [I]_p13081 feared that [he]_p13082 was about to make another homicidal attack. [My]_p13083 fears, however, were groundless, for [he]_p13084 held up [his]_p13085 two hands imploringly, and made [his]_p13086 petition in a moving manner. As [he]_p13087 saw that the very excess of [his]_p13089 emotion was militating against him, by restoring [us]_p13090 more to [our]_p13091 old relations, [he]_p13088 became still more demonstrative. [I]_p13092 glanced at [Van Helsing]_n,1570 and saw [my]_p13094 conviction reflected in [his]_p13096 eyes so [I]_p13093 became a little more fixed in [my]_p13095 manner, if not more stern, and motioned to [him]_p13098 that [his]_p13097 efforts were unavailing. [I]_p13099 had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in [him]_p13101 when [he]_p13102 had to make some request of which at the time [he]_p13103 had thought much, such, for instance, as when [he]_p13103 wanted a cat and [I]_p13100 was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. [My]_p13105 expectation was not realised, for, when [he]_p13106 found that [his]_p13108 appeal would not be successful, [he]_p13107 got into quite a frantic condition.",2,,37,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p13109 threw [himself]_p13110 on [his]_p13111 knees, and held up [his]_p13112 hands, wringing [them]_p13115 in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down [his]_p13112 cheeks, and [his]_p13113 whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:, ""Let [me]_p13116 entreat you, Dr [Seward]_n,1571 oh, let [me]_p13117 implore you, to let [me]_p13117 out of this house at once. Send [me]_p13119 away how [you]_p13123 will and where [you]_p13124 will  send keepers with [me]_p13120 with whips and chains let [them]_p13125 take [me]_p13120 in a strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol but let [me]_p13121 go out of this. [You]_p13126 don't know what [you]_p13127 do by keeping [me]_p13128 here. [I]_p13129 am speaking from the depths of [my]_p13130 heart, of [my]_p13131 very soul. [You]_p13132 don't know whom [you]_p13133 wrong, or how and [I]_p13134 may not tell. Woe is me! [I]_p13135 may not tell. By all [you]_p13136 hold sacred, by all [you]_p13137 hold [dear]_n,1572 by [your]_p13142 love that is lost, by [your]_p13143 hope that lives, for the sake of the [Almighty]_n,1573 take [me]_p13144 out of this and save [my]_p13151 soul from guilt! Can't [you]_p13137 hear me, man? Can't [you]_p13138 understand? Will [you]_p13138 never learn? Don't [you]_p13138 know that [I]_p13152 am sane and earnest now that [I]_p13153 am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for [his]_p13156 soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let [me]_p13145 go! let [me]_p13145 go! let [me]_p13146 go!"" [I]_p13153 thought that the longer this went on the wilder [he]_p13157 would get, and so would bring on a fit so [I]_p13154 took [him]_p13158 by the hand and raised [him]_p13159 up. ""Come,"" [I]_p13160 said sternly, ""no more of this [we]_p13161 have had quite enough already. Get to [your]_p13162 bed and try to behave more discreetly. ""  [He]_p13163 suddenly stopped and looked at [me]_p13164 intently for several moments.",3,,53,
stoker_dracula," Then, without a word, [he]_p13165 rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as [I]_p13166 had expected. When [I]_p13167 was leaving the room, last of [our]_p13171 party, [he]_p13172 said to [me]_p13173 in a quiet, well-bred voice:, ""You will, [I]_p13168 trust, Dr [Seward]_n,1574 do [me]_p13174 the justice to bear in mind, later on, that [I]_p13168 did what [I]_p13169 could to convince [you]_p13175 [to-night]_n1575. "" CHAPTER XIX [JONATHAN HARKER]_n'S1576 JOURNAL 1 October, 5 a. m. , [I]_p13176 went with the party to the search with an easy mind, for [I]_p13177 think [I]_p13177 never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. [I]_p13179 am so glad that [she]_p13180 consented to hold back and let [us]_p13181 men do the work. Somehow, [it]_p13182 was a dread to [me]_p13184 that [she]_p13185 was in this fearful business at all but now that [her]_p13188 work is done, and that [it]_p13183 is due to [her]_p13189 energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells, [she]_p13186 may well feel that [her]_p13189 part is finished, and that [she]_p13186 can henceforth leave the rest to us. [We]_p13191 were, [I]_p13192 think, all a little upset by the scene with [Mr Renfield]_n1577. When [we]_p13193 came away from [his]_p13196 room [we]_p13194 were silent till [we]_p13194 got back to the study.",4,,32,
stoker_dracula," Then Mr Morris said to Dr [Seward]_n:,1578 ""Say, [Jack]_n,1579 if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, [he]_p13197 is about the sanest lunatic [I]_p13198 ever saw. I'm not sure, but [I]_p13199 believe that [he]_p13201 had some serious purpose, and if [he]_p13202 had, [it]_p13203 was pretty rough on [him]_p13204 not to get a chance. "" [Lord]_n1580 [Godalming]_n1581 and [I]_p13205 were silent, but Dr [Van Helsing]_n1582 added:, ""[Friend John]_n,1583 [you]_p13210 know more of lunatics than [I]_p13206 do, and I'm glad of it, for [I]_p13206 fear that if [it]_p13211 had been to [me]_p13213 to decide [I]_p13207 would before that last hysterical outburst have given [him]_p13214 free. But [we]_p13215 live and learn, and in [our]_p13217 present task [we]_p13216 must take no chance, as [my]_p13218 friend [Quincey]_n1584 would say. All is best as [they]_p13219 are. "" [Dr Seward]_n1585 seemed to answer [them]_p13220 both in a dreamy kind of way:, ""I don't know but that [I]_p13221 agree with you. If that man had been an ordinary lunatic [I]_p13223 would have taken [my]_p13225 chance of trusting [him]_p13226 but [he]_p13227 seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that [I]_p13224 am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping [his]_p13228 fads. [I]_p13229 can't forget how [he]_p13230 prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear [my]_p13231 throat out with [his]_p13232 teeth. Besides, [he]_p13233 called the Count 'lord and master,' and [he]_p13234 may want to get out to help [him]_p13235 in some diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and [his]_p13236 own kind to help him, so [I]_p13237 suppose [he]_p13238 isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic.",8,,38,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p13239 certainly did seem earnest, though. [I]_p13240 only hope [we]_p13241 have done what is best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work [we]_p13242 have in hand, help to unnerve a man. "" The [Professor]_n1586 stepped over, and laying [his]_p13243 hand on [his]_p13244 shoulder, said in [his]_p13244 grave, kindly way:, ""[Friend John]_n,1587 have no fear. [We]_p13246 are trying to do [our]_p13247 duty in a very sad and terrible case [we]_p13248 can only do as [we]_p13249 deem best. What else have [we]_p13250 to hope for, except the pity of the good God?"" [Lord Godalming]_n1588 had slipped away for a few minutes, but now [he]_p13251 returned. [He]_p13252 held up a little silver whistle, as [he]_p13253 remarked:,   ""That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on call. "" Having passed the wall, [we]_p13254 took [our]_p13255 way to the house, taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out. When [we]_p13256 got to the porch the [Professor]_n1589 opened [his]_p13257 bag and took out a lot of things, which [he]_p13258 laid on the step, sorting [them]_p13259 into four little groups, evidently one for each. Then [he]_p13260 spoke:,   ""My friends, [we]_p13261 are going into a terrible danger, and [we]_p13262 need arms of many kinds.",4,,24,
stoker_dracula," [Our]_p13263 enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that [he]_p13264 has the strength of twenty men, and that, though [our]_p13265 necks or [our]_p13266 windpipes are of the common kind, and therefore breakable or crushable, [his]_p13267 are not amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold [him]_p13268 but [they]_p13272 cannot hurt [him]_p13269 as [we]_p13273 can be hurt by him. [We]_p13274 must, therefore, guard [ourselves]_p13275 from [his]_p13276 touch. Keep this near [your]_p13277 heart"", as [he]_p13280 spoke [he]_p13281 lifted a little silver crucifix and held [it]_p13283 out to me, [I]_p13286 being nearest to him, ""put these flowers round [your]_p13278 neck"", here [he]_p13281 handed to [me]_p13284 a wreath of withered garlic blossoms, ""for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which [you]_p13287 can fasten to [your]_p13278 breast and for all, and above all at the last, this, which [we]_p13288 must not desecrate needless. "" This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which [he]_p13289 put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others was similarly equipped. ""Now,"" [he]_p13290 said, ""friend John, where are the skeleton keys? If so that [we]_p13291 can open the door, [we]_p13292 need not break house by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's. "" Dr [Seward]_n1590 tried one or two skeleton keys, [his]_p13293 mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing [him]_p13294 in good stead. Presently [he]_p13295 got one to suit after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty clang, shot back.",1,,30,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p13296 pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and [it]_p13297 slowly opened. [It]_p13298 was startlingly like the image conveyed to [me]_p13299 in Dr [Seward]_n's1591 diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb [I]_p13300 fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord [they]_p13301 shrank back. The [Professor]_n1592 was the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door. ""In manus tuas, Domine!"" [he]_p13302 said, crossing [himself]_p13304 as [he]_p13303 passed over the threshold. [We]_p13305 closed the door behind us, lest when [we]_p13306 should have lit [our]_p13308 lamps [we]_p13307 should possibly attract attention from the road. The [Professor]_n1593 carefully tried the lock, lest [we]_p13309 might not be able to open [it]_p13311 from within should [we]_p13310 be in a hurry making [our]_p13312 exit. Then [we]_p13313 all lit [our]_p13314 lamps and proceeded on [our]_p13315 search. The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of [our]_p13316 bodies threw great shadows. [I]_p13317 could not for [my]_p13318 life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us. [I]_p13319 suppose [it]_p13320 was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to [me]_p13321 by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in [Transylvania]_n1594.",4,,26,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13322 think the feeling was common to [us]_p13325 all, for [I]_p13323 noticed that the others kept looking over [their]_p13326 shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as [I]_p13323 felt [myself]_p13327 doing. The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down [my]_p13328 lamp [I]_p13329 could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till [they]_p13330 looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn [them]_p13331 partly down. On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. [They]_p13332 had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the [Professor]_n1595 lifted them. [He]_p13333 turned to [me]_p13334 and said:, ""You know this place, [Jonathan]_n1596. [You]_p13335 have copied maps of it, and [you]_p13338 know [it]_p13336 at least more than [we]_p13339 do. Which is the way to the chapel?"" [I]_p13340 had an idea of [its]_p13343 direction, though on [my]_p13344 former visit [I]_p13341 had not been able to get admission to [it]_p13345 so [I]_p13341 led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found [myself]_p13346 opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands. ""This is the spot,"" said the [Professor]_n1597 as [he]_p13347 turned [his]_p13348 lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of [my]_p13349 original correspondence regarding the purchase.",3,,27,
stoker_dracula," With a little trouble [we]_p13350 found the key on the bunch and opened the door. [We]_p13351 were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as [we]_p13352 were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of [us]_p13354 ever expected such an odour as [we]_p13353 encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters, and when [I]_p13355 had seen [him]_p13356 [he]_p13357 was either in the fasting stage of [his]_p13359 existence in [his]_p13360 rooms or, when [he]_p13358 was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air. But as to the odour itself, how shall [I]_p13363 describe it? [It]_p13367 was not alone that [it]_p13364 was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but [it]_p13365 seemed as though corruption had become [itself]_p13361 corrupt. Faugh! [it]_p13368 sickens [me]_p13370 to think of it. Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified [its]_p13371 loathsomeness. Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought [our]_p13372 enterprise to an end but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which [we]_p13373 were involved gave [us]_p13374 a strength which rose above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, [we]_p13375 one and all set about [our]_p13376 work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses. [We]_p13377 made an accurate examination of the place, the [Professor]_n1598 saying as [we]_p13378 began:, ""The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left [we]_p13379 must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if [we]_p13379 cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest.",1,,28,
stoker_dracula," "" A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them. There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once [I]_p13381 got a fright, for, seeing [Lord]_n1599 [Godalming]_n1600 suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, [I]_p13382 looked too, and for an instant [my]_p13383 heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, [I]_p13384 seemed to see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. [It]_p13385 was only for a moment, for, as [Lord]_n1601 [Godalming]_n1602 said, ""I thought [I]_p13386 saw a face, but [it]_p13389 was only the shadows,"" and resumed [his]_p13390 inquiry, [I]_p13387 turned [my]_p13391 lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for him. [I]_p13392 took [it]_p13393 that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing. A few minutes later [I]_p13394 saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which [he]_p13395 was examining. [We]_p13396 all followed [his]_p13397 movements with [our]_p13398 eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and [we]_p13399 saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. [We]_p13400 all instinctively drew back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.",4,,19,
stoker_dracula," For a moment or two [we]_p13401 stood appalled, all [save Lord Godalming]_n,1603 who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr [Seward]_n1604 had described from the outside, and which [I]_p13402 had seen myself, [he]_p13403 turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking [his]_p13404 little silver whistle from [his]_p13405 pocket, [he]_p13406 blew a low, shrill call. [It]_p13407 was answered from behind [Dr Seward]_n's1605 house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house. Unconsciously [we]_p13408 had all moved towards the door, and as [we]_p13409 moved [I]_p13410 noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. [They]_p13411 seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on [their]_p13412 moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting [their]_p13413 noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were multiplying in thousands, and [we]_p13414 moved out. [Lord Godalming]_n1606 lifted one of the dogs, and carrying [him]_p13415 in, placed [him]_p13416 on the floor.",4,,16,
stoker_dracula," The instant [his]_p13417 feet touched the ground [he]_p13420 seemed to recover [his]_p13418 courage, and rushed at [his]_p13418 natural enemies. [They]_p13421 fled before [him]_p13422 so fast that before [he]_p13423 had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished. With [their]_p13424 going [it]_p13426 seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as [they]_p13427 made sudden darts at [their]_p13425 prostrate foes, and turned [them]_p13428 over and over and tossed [them]_p13429 in the air with vicious shakes. [We]_p13430 all seemed to find [our]_p13431 spirits rise. Whether [it]_p13432 was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which [we]_p13433 experienced by finding [ourselves]_p13435 in the open [I]_p13436 know not but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from [us]_p13437 like a robe, and the occasion of [our]_p13438 coming lost something of [its]_p13440 grim significance, though [we]_p13434 did not slacken a whit in [our]_p13439 resolution. [We]_p13441 closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began [our]_p13442 search of the house. [We]_p13443 found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for [my]_p13444 own footsteps when [I]_p13446 had made [my]_p13445 first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when [we]_p13447 returned to the chapel [they]_p13448 frisked about as though [they]_p13449 had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood. The morning was quickening in the east when [we]_p13450 emerged from the front. Dr [Van Helsing]_n1607 had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into [his]_p13451 pocket when [he]_p13452 had done.",1,,36,
stoker_dracula," ""So far,"" [he]_p13453 said, ""our night has been eminently successful. No harm has come to [us]_p13454 such as [I]_p13455 feared might be and yet [we]_p13456 have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More than all do [I]_p13457 rejoice that this, [our]_p13458 first, and perhaps [our]_p13459 most difficult and dangerous, step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto [our]_p13459 most sweet [Madam]_n1608 Mina or troubling [her]_p13461 waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which [she]_p13462 might never forget. One lesson, too, [we]_p13463 have learned, if [it]_p13464 be allowable to argue a particulari: that the brute beasts which are to the Count's command are yet [themselves]_p13465 not amenable to [his]_p13466 spiritual power for look, these rats that would come to [his]_p13467 call, just as from [his]_p13467 castle top [he]_p13469 summon the wolves to [your]_p13470 going and to that poor mother's cry, though [they]_p13471 come to him, [they]_p13472 run pell-mell from the so little dogs of [my]_p13473 friend Arthur. [We]_p13474 have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears and that monster, [he]_p13475 has not used [his]_p13476 power over the brute world for the only or the last time [to-night]_n1609. So be [it]_p13477 that [he]_p13478 has gone elsewhere. Good! [It]_p13479 has given [us]_p13480 opportunity to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which [we]_p13481 play for the stake of human souls. And now let [us]_p13482 go home. The dawn is close at hand, and [we]_p13483 have reason to be content with [our]_p13484 first night's work. [It]_p13485 may be ordained that [we]_p13486 have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril  but [we]_p13487 must go on, and from no danger shall [we]_p13487 shrink.",2,,36,
stoker_dracula," ""  The house was silent when [we]_p13489 got back, save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain. [I]_p13490 came tiptoe into [our]_p13492 own room, and found [Mina]_n1610 asleep, breathing so softly that [I]_p13491 had to put [my]_p13493 ear down to hear it. [She]_p13494 looks paler than usual. [I]_p13495 hope the meeting [to-night]_n1611 has not upset her. [I]_p13496 am truly thankful that [she]_p13497 is to be left out of [our]_p13498 future work, and even of [our]_p13499 deliberations. [It]_p13500 is too great a strain for a woman to bear. [I]_p13501 did not think so at first, but [I]_p13502 know better now. Therefore [I]_p13503 am glad that [it]_p13504 is settled. There may be things which would frighten [her]_p13505 to hear and yet to conceal [them]_p13508 from [her]_p13506 might be worse than to tell [her]_p13506 if once [she]_p13509 suspected that there was any concealment.",2,,21,
stoker_dracula," Henceforth [our]_p13510 work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as [we]_p13513 can tell [her]_p13511 that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. [I]_p13514 daresay [it]_p13517 will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours but [I]_p13515 must be resolute, and to-morrow [I]_p13515 shall keep dark over [to-night]_n's1612 doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened. [I]_p13518 [rest]_n1613 on the sofa, so as not to disturb her. * * * * *  1 October, later. , [I]_p13519 suppose [it]_p13520 was natural that [we]_p13521 should have all overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no [rest]_n1614 at all. Even Mina must have felt [its]_p13522 exhaustion, for though [I]_p13523 slept till the sun was high, [I]_p13524 was awake before her, and had to call two or three times before [she]_p13525 awoke. Indeed, [she]_p13526 was so sound asleep that for a few seconds [she]_p13527 did not recognize me, but looked at [me]_p13528 with a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. [She]_p13530 complained a little of being tired, and [I]_p13531 let [her]_p13532 rest till later in the day. [We]_p13533 now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if [it]_p13534 be that several were taken in any of these removals [we]_p13535 may be able to trace [them]_p13536 all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify [our]_p13537 labour, and the sooner the matter is attended to the better.",3,,26,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13538 shall look up [Thomas Snelling]_n1615 to-day. [Dr Seward]_n's1616 [Diary]_n1617. 1 October. , [It]_p13539 was towards noon when [I]_p13540 was awakened by the [Professor]_n1618 walking into [my]_p13541 room. [He]_p13542 was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and [it]_p13543 is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off [his]_p13544 mind. After going over the adventure of the night [he]_p13545 suddenly said:,   ""Your patient interests [me]_p13546 much. May [it]_p13547 be that with [you]_p13549 [I]_p13551 visit [him]_p13553 this morning? Or if that [you]_p13550 are too occupy, [I]_p13552 can go alone if [it]_p13548 may be. [It]_p13554 is a new experience to [me]_p13555 to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound. "" [I]_p13556 had some work to do which pressed, so [I]_p13557 told [him]_p13561 that if [he]_p13564 would go alone [I]_p13557 would be glad, as then [I]_p13558 should not have to keep [him]_p13562 waiting so [I]_p13558 called an attendant and gave [him]_p13562 the necessary instructions. Before the [Professor]_n1619 left the room [I]_p13565 cautioned [him]_p13566 against getting any false impression from [my]_p13567 patient.",5,,30,
stoker_dracula," ""But,"" [he]_p13568 answered, ""I want [him]_p13569 to talk of [himself]_p13570 and of [his]_p13571 delusion as to consuming live things. [He]_p13572 said to [Madam Mina]_n,1620 as [I]_p13573 see in [your]_p13574 diary of yesterday, that [he]_p13575 had once had such a belief. Why do [you]_p13576 smile, friend John?""  ""Excuse me,"" [I]_p13577 said, ""but the answer is here. "" [I]_p13578 laid [my]_p13579 hand on the type-written matter. ""When [our]_p13580 sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how [he]_p13581 used to consume life, [his]_p13583 mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which [he]_p13582 had eaten just before Mrs Harker entered the room. "" [Van Helsing]_n1621 smiled in turn. ""[Good]_n!""1622 [he]_p13584 said. ""Your memory is true, friend John. [I]_p13585 should have remembered. And yet [it]_p13586 is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study.",3,,19,
stoker_dracula," Perhaps [I]_p13587 may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than [I]_p13588 shall from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?"" [I]_p13589 went on with [my]_p13590 work, and before long was through that in hand. [It]_p13591 seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was [Van Helsing]_n1623 back in the study. ""Do [I]_p13592 interrupt?"" [he]_p13593 asked politely as [he]_p13594 stood at the door. ""Not at all,"" [I]_p13595 answered. ""Come in. [My]_p13596 work is finished, and [I]_p13597 am free. [I]_p13598 can go with [you]_p13599 now, if [you]_p13600 like. ""It is needless [I]_p13601 have seen him!""  ""Well?""  ""I fear that [he]_p13603 does not appraise [me]_p13604 at much. [Our]_p13605 interview was short.",1,,18,
stoker_dracula," When [I]_p13606 entered [his]_p13607 room [he]_p13611 was sitting on a stool in the centre, with [his]_p13608 elbows on [his]_p13608 knees, and [his]_p13609 face was the picture of sullen discontent. [I]_p13612 spoke to [him]_p13615 as cheerfully as [I]_p13613 could, and with such a measure of respect as [I]_p13613 could assume. [He]_p13616 made no reply whatever. ""Don't [you]_p13617 know me?"" [I]_p13618 asked. [His]_p13619 answer was not reassuring: ""I know [you]_p13620 well enough [you]_p13621 are the old fool [Van Helsing]_n1624. [I]_p13622 wish [you]_p13623 would take [yourself]_p13624 and [your]_p13625 idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!"" Not a word more would [he]_p13626 say, but sat in [his]_p13627 implacable sullenness as indifferent to [me]_p13628 as though [I]_p13629 had not been in the room at all. Thus departed for this time [my]_p13630 chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic so [I]_p13631 shall go, if [I]_p13632 may, and cheer [myself]_p13633 with a few happy words with that sweet soul [Madam Mina]_n1625. [Friend John]_n,1626 [it]_p13634 does rejoice [me]_p13635 unspeakable that [she]_p13636 is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with [our]_p13637 terrible things. Though [we]_p13638 shall much miss [her]_p13639 help, [it]_p13640 is better so.",3,,35,
stoker_dracula," ""  ""I agree with [you]_p13644 with all [my]_p13645 heart,"" [I]_p13641 answered earnestly, for [I]_p13642 did not want [him]_p13646 to weaken in this matter. ""[Mrs Harker]_n1627 is better out of it. Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight places in [our]_p13647 time but [it]_p13648 is no place for a woman, and if [she]_p13650 had remained in touch with the affair, [it]_p13649 would in time infallibly have wrecked her. "" So [Van Helsing]_n1628 has gone to confer with [Mrs Harker]_n1629 and [Harker Quincey]_n1630 and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. [I]_p13651 shall finish [my]_p13652 round of work and [we]_p13653 shall meet [to-night]_n1631. Mina Harker's [Journal]_n1632. 1 October. , [It]_p13654 is strange to [me]_p13655 to be kept in the dark as [I]_p13656 am to-day  after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see [him]_p13657 manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This morning [I]_p13658 slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though [Jonathan]_n1633 was late too, [he]_p13659 was the earlier. [He]_p13660 spoke to [me]_p13661 before [he]_p13662 went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but [he]_p13663 never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Count's house.",7,,22,
stoker_dracula," And yet [he]_p13664 must have known how terribly anxious [I]_p13665 was. [Poor]_n1634 [dear]_n1635 fellow! [I]_p13666 suppose [it]_p13667 must have distressed [him]_p13669 even more than [it]_p13668 did me. [They]_p13670 all agreed that [it]_p13671 was best that [I]_p13672 should not be drawn further into this awful work, and [I]_p13673 acquiesced. But to think that [he]_p13674 keeps anything from me! And now [I]_p13675 am crying like a silly fool, when [I]_p13676 know [it]_p13677 comes from [my]_p13678 husband's great love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men. That has done [me]_p13679 good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell [me]_p13680 all and lest [it]_p13681 should ever be that [he]_p13682 should think for a moment that [I]_p13683 kept anything from him, [I]_p13684 still keep [my]_p13685 journal as usual. Then if [he]_p13686 has feared of [my]_p13687 trust [I]_p13689 shall show [it]_p13690 to him, with every thought of [my]_p13688 heart put down for [his]_p13691 [dear]_n1636 eyes to read. [I]_p13692 feel strangely sad and low-spirited [to-day]_n1637. [I]_p13693 suppose [it]_p13694 is the reaction from the terrible excitement. Last night [I]_p13695 went to bed when the men had gone, simply because [they]_p13696 told [me]_p13697 to.",4,,34,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13698 didn't feel sleepy, and [I]_p13699 did feel full of devouring anxiety. [I]_p13700 kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see [me]_p13701 in London, and [it]_p13702 all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does seems, no matter how right [it]_p13703 may be, to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored. If [I]_p13704 hadn't gone to [Whitby]_n,1638 perhaps poor [dear]_n1639 [Lucy]_n1640 would be with [us]_p13705 now. [She]_p13706 hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard till [I]_p13707 came, and if [she]_p13708 hadn't come there in the day-time with [me]_p13711 [she]_p13709 wouldn't have walked there in [her]_p13712 sleep and if [she]_p13709 hadn't gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed [her]_p13713 as [he]_p13714 did. Oh, why did [I]_p13715 ever go to [Whitby]_n?1641 There now, crying again! [I]_p13716 wonder what has come over [me]_p13717 to-day. [I]_p13718 must hide [it]_p13721 from Jonathan, for if [he]_p13722 knew that [I]_p13719 had been crying twice in one morning, I, who never cried on [my]_p13724 own account, and whom [he]_p13723 has never caused to shed a tear, the [dear]_n1642 fellow would fret [his]_p13725 heart out. [I]_p13726 shall put a bold face on, and if [I]_p13727 do feel weepy, [he]_p13728 shall never see it. [I]_p13729 suppose [it]_p13730 is one of the lessons that [we]_p13731 poor women have to learn. [I]_p13732 can't quite remember how [I]_p13733 fell asleep last night.",5,,35,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13734 remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from [Mr Renfield]_n's1643 room, which is somewhere under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound that [it]_p13735 startled me, and [I]_p13736 got up and looked out of the window. All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of [their]_p13737 own. Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of [its]_p13738 own. [I]_p13739 think that the digression of [my]_p13742 thoughts must have done [me]_p13743 good, for when [I]_p13740 got back to bed [I]_p13740 found a lethargy creeping over me. [I]_p13745 lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so [I]_p13746 got out and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that [I]_p13747 could see [it]_p13748 lying thick against the wall, as though [it]_p13749 were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was more loud than ever, and though [I]_p13750 could not distinguish a word [he]_p13752 said, [I]_p13751 could in some way recognise in [his]_p13753 tones some passionate entreaty on [his]_p13754 part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and [I]_p13755 knew that the attendants were dealing with him. [I]_p13756 was so frightened that [I]_p13757 crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over [my]_p13758 head, putting [my]_p13759 fingers in [my]_p13759 ears.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13761 was not then a bit sleepy, at least so [I]_p13762 thought but [I]_p13762 must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, [I]_p13763 do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me. [I]_p13765 think that [it]_p13767 took [me]_p13769 an effort and a little time to realise where [I]_p13766 was, and that [it]_p13768 was Jonathan who was bending over me. [My]_p13771 dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams. [I]_p13772 thought that [I]_p13773 was asleep, and waiting for [Jonathan]_n1644 to come back. [I]_p13774 was very anxious about him, and [I]_p13775 was powerless to act [my]_p13776 feet, and [my]_p13777 hands, and [my]_p13777 brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so [I]_p13779 slept uneasily and thought. Then [it]_p13780 began to dawn upon [me]_p13781 that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. [I]_p13782 put back the clothes from [my]_p13783 face, and found, to [my]_p13784 surprise, that all was dim around. The gaslight which [I]_p13785 had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room. Then [it]_p13786 occurred to [me]_p13787 that [I]_p13788 had shut the window before [I]_p13789 had come to bed.",1,,28,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13790 would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain [my]_p13791 limbs and even [my]_p13792 will. [I]_p13793 lay still and endured that was all. [I]_p13794 closed [my]_p13795 eyes, but could still see through [my]_p13796 eyelids. (It is wonderful what tricks [our]_p13797 dreams play us, and how conveniently [we]_p13798 can imagine. ) The mist grew thicker and thicker and [I]_p13799 could see now how [it]_p13801 came in, for [I]_p13800 could see [it]_p13802 like smoke, or with the white energy of boiling water, pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door. [It]_p13803 got thicker and thicker, till [it]_p13804 seemed as if [it]_p13805 became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which [I]_p13806 could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things began to whirl through [my]_p13807 brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and through [it]_p13808 all came the scriptural words ""a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night. "" Was [it]_p13809 indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to [me]_p13810 in [my]_p13814 sleep? But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for [me]_p13811 till, as [I]_p13815 looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on [me]_p13811 through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told [me]_p13812 of in [her]_p13816 momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of [St]_n1645. Mary's [Church]_n1646. Suddenly the horror burst upon [me]_p13817 that [it]_p13818 was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in [my]_p13819 dream [I]_p13820 must have fainted, for all became black darkness.",2,,31,
stoker_dracula," The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show [me]_p13821 a livid white face bending over [me]_p13822 out of the mist. [I]_p13823 must be careful of such dreams, for [they]_p13824 would unseat one's reason if there were too much of them. [I]_p13825 would get [Dr Van Helsing]_n1647 or [Dr Seward]_n1648 to prescribe something for [me]_p13827 which would make [me]_p13828 sleep, only that [I]_p13826 fear to alarm them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into [their]_p13829 fears for me. To-night [I]_p13830 shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If [I]_p13831 do not, [I]_p13832 shall to-morrow night get [them]_p13833 to give [me]_p13834 a dose of chloral that cannot hurt [me]_p13835 for once, and [it]_p13837 will give [me]_p13835 a good night's sleep. Last night tired [me]_p13838 more than if [I]_p13839 had not slept at all. * * * * *  2 October 10 p. m. , Last night [I]_p13840 slept, but did not dream.",2,,20,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13841 must have slept soundly, for [I]_p13842 was not waked by [Jonathan]_n1649 coming to bed but the sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day [I]_p13842 feel terribly weak and spiritless. [I]_p13844 spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing. In the afternoon [Mr Renfield]_n1650 asked if [he]_p13845 might see me. [Poor]_n1651 man, [he]_p13846 was very gentle, and when [I]_p13848 came away [he]_p13847 kissed [my]_p13849 hand and bade God bless me. Some way [it]_p13850 affected [me]_p13851 much [I]_p13852 am crying when [I]_p13853 think of him. This is a new weakness, of which [I]_p13854 must be careful. Jonathan would be miserable if [he]_p13855 knew [I]_p13856 had been crying. [He]_p13857 and the others were out till dinner-time, and [they]_p13858 all came in tired. [I]_p13859 did what [I]_p13860 could to brighten [them]_p13864 up, and [I]_p13860 suppose that the effort did [me]_p13865 good, for [I]_p13861 forgot how tired [I]_p13861 was. After dinner [they]_p13866 sent [me]_p13869 to bed, and all went off to smoke together, as [they]_p13867 said, but [I]_p13870 knew that [they]_p13867 wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day [I]_p13871 could see from Jonathan's manner that [he]_p13872 had something important to communicate.",3,,32,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13873 was not so sleepy as [I]_p13874 should have been so before [they]_p13877 went [I]_p13874 asked Dr [Seward]_n1652 to give [me]_p13878 a little opiate of some kind, as [I]_p13875 had not slept well the night before. [He]_p13879 very kindly made [me]_p13880 up a sleeping draught, which [he]_p13884 gave to me, telling [me]_p13881 that [it]_p13885 would do [me]_p13881 no harm, as [it]_p13886 was very mild. [I]_p13887 have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. [I]_p13888 hope [I]_p13889 have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that [I]_p13889 may have been foolish in thus depriving [myself]_p13891 of the power of waking. [I]_p13892 might want it. Here comes sleep. [Good-night]_n1653. CHAPTER XX JONATHAN [HARKER]_n'S1654 JOURNAL 1 October, evening. , [I]_p13893 found [Thomas Snelling]_n1655 in [his]_p13894 house at Bethnal [Green]_n,1656 but unhappily [he]_p13895 was not in a condition to remember anything. The very prospect of beer which [my]_p13896 expected coming had opened to [him]_p13897 had proved too much, and [he]_p13898 had begun too early on [his]_p13899 expected debauch.",5,,26,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13900 learned, however, from [his]_p13901 wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that [he]_p13902 was only the assistant to [Smollet]_n,1657 who of the two mates was the responsible person. So off [I]_p13903 drove to [Walworth]_n,1658 and found [Mr Joseph Smollet]_n1659 at home and in [his]_p13904 shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer. [He]_p13905 is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of [his]_p13906 own. [He]_p13907 remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared notebook, which [he]_p13908 produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of [his]_p13910 trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, half-obliterated pencil, [he]_p13909 gave [me]_p13911 the destinations of the boxes. There were, [he]_p13912 said, six in the cartload which [he]_p13913 took from Carfax and left at 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which [he]_p13913 deposited at [Jamaica Lane]_n,1660 Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of [his]_p13915 over London, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later [he]_p13916 might distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made [me]_p13917 think that [he]_p13918 could not mean to confine [himself]_p13919 to two sides of London. [He]_p13920 was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of [his]_p13921 diabolical scheme, let alone the City [itself]_p13922 and the very heart of fashionable [London]_n1661 in the south-west and west. [I]_p13923 went back to [Smollet]_n,1662 and asked [him]_p13924 if [he]_p13925 could tell [us]_p13926 if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax.",6,,27,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p13927 replied:,   ""Well, guv'nor, you've treated [me]_p13928 wery 'an'some"", [I]_p13929 had given [him]_p13932 half a sovereign, ""an' I'll tell [yer]_p13933 all [I]_p13930 know. [I]_p13934 heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley, as 'ow [he]_p13935 an' [his]_p13936 mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at Purfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin' that maybe [Sam Bloxam]_n1663 could tell [ye]_p13937 summut. "" [I]_p13938 asked if [he]_p13939 could tell [me]_p13940 where to find him. [I]_p13941 told [him]_p13942 that if [he]_p13944 could get [me]_p13945 the address [it]_p13946 would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So [he]_p13947 gulped down the rest of [his]_p13949 tea and stood up, saying that [he]_p13948 was going to begin the search then and there. At the door [he]_p13950 stopped, and said:,   ""Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in [me]_p13951 a-keepin' [you]_p13952 'ere. [I]_p13953 may find [Sam]_n1664 soon, or [I]_p13954 mayn't but anyhow [he]_p13955 ain't like to be in a way to tell [ye]_p13956 much [to-night]_n1665. [Sam]_n1666 is a rare one when [he]_p13957 starts on the booze. If [you]_p13958 can give [me]_p13959 a envelope with a stamp on it, and put [yer]_p13963 address on it, I'll find out where [Sam]_n1667 is to be found and post [it]_p13960 [ye]_p13964 [to-night]_n1668.",6,,34,
stoker_dracula," But ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe [ye]_p13965 won't ketch 'im for [Sam]_n1669 gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore. ""  This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When [she]_p13967 came back, [I]_p13968 addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when [Smollet]_n1670 had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, [I]_p13969 took [my]_p13970 way to home. We're on the track anyhow. [I]_p13971 am tired [to-night]_n,1671 and want sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale [her]_p13972 eyes look as though [she]_p13973 had been crying. [Poor]_n1672 [dear]_n,1673 I've no doubt [it]_p13974 frets [her]_p13976 to be kept in the dark, and [it]_p13975 may make [her]_p13977 doubly anxious about [me]_p13978 and the others. But [it]_p13979 is best as [it]_p13980 is. [It]_p13981 is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have [her]_p13982 nerve broken. The doctors were quite right to insist on [her]_p13983 being kept out of this dreadful business.",5,,18,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p13984 must be firm, for on [me]_p13985 this particular burden of silence must rest. [I]_p13986 shall not ever enter on the subject with [her]_p13987 under any circumstances. Indeed, [it]_p13988 may not be a hard task, after all, for [she]_p13989 [herself]_p13990 has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the Count or [his]_p13991 doings ever since [we]_p13992 told [her]_p13993 of [our]_p13994 decision. * * * * *  2 October, evening. , A long and trying and exciting day. By the first post [I]_p13995 got [my]_p13996 directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:, ""Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, [Poters]_n1674 Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for the depite. ""  [I]_p13997 got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. [She]_p13998 looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well. [I]_p13999 determined not to wake her, but that, when [I]_p14000 should return from this new search, [I]_p14000 would arrange for [her]_p14002 going back to [Exeter]_n1675.",2,,19,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14004 think [she]_p14005 would be happier in [our]_p14006 own home, with [her]_p14007 daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst [us]_p14009 and in ignorance. [I]_p14010 only saw Dr [Seward]_n1676 for a moment, and told [him]_p14013 where [I]_p14011 was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as [I]_p14011 should have found out anything. [I]_p14014 drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter's Court. Mr Smollet's spelling misled me, as [I]_p14015 asked for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when [I]_p14016 had found the court, [I]_p14017 had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house. When [I]_p14018 asked the man who came to the door for the ""depite,"" [he]_p14020 shook [his]_p14021 head, and said: ""I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere [I]_p14022 never 'eard of 'im in all [my]_p14023 bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody of that kind livin' ere or anywheres. "" [I]_p14024 took out [Smollet]_n's1677 letter, and as [I]_p14025 read [it]_p14026 [it]_p14027 seemed to [me]_p14028 that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me. ""What are you?"" [I]_p14030 asked.",2,,24,
stoker_dracula," ""I'm the depity,"" [he]_p14031 answered. [I]_p14032 saw at once that [I]_p14033 was on the right track phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the deputy's knowledge at [my]_p14034 disposal, and [I]_p14035 learned that Mr Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of [his]_p14036 beer on the previous night at Corcoran's, had left for [his]_p14037 work at Poplar at five o'clock that morning. [He]_p14038 could not tell [me]_p14039 where the place of work was situated, but [he]_p14040 had a vague idea that [it]_p14041 was some kind of a ""new-fangled ware'us""  and with this slender clue [I]_p14042 had to start for Poplar. [It]_p14043 was twelve o'clock before [I]_p14044 got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this [I]_p14045 got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having [their]_p14046 dinner. One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new ""cold storage"" building and as this suited the condition of a ""new-fangled ware'us,"" [I]_p14047 at once drove to it. An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put [me]_p14048 on the track of Bloxam [he]_p14049 was sent for on [my]_p14050 suggesting that [I]_p14051 was willing to pay [his]_p14052 day's wages to [his]_p14053 foreman for the privilege of asking [him]_p14054 a few questions on a private matter. [He]_p14055 was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When [I]_p14056 had promised to pay for [his]_p14057 information and given [him]_p14058 an earnest, [he]_p14060 told [me]_p14062 that [he]_p14061 had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in [Piccadilly]_n,1678 and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes, ""main heavy ones"", with a horse and cart hired by [him]_p14059 for this purpose. [I]_p14063 asked [him]_p14065 if [he]_p14066 could tell [me]_p14068 the number of the house in [Piccadilly]_n,1679 to which [he]_p14067 replied:, ""Well, guv'nor, [I]_p14064 forgits the number, but [it]_p14069 was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built.",2,,39,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p14070 was a dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse [we]_p14071 tooked the bloomin' boxes from. ""  ""How did [you]_p14072 get into the houses if [they]_p14073 were both empty?""  ""There was the old party what engaged [me]_p14074 a-waitin' in the 'ouse at Purfleet. [He]_p14075 'elped [me]_p14076 to lift the boxes and put [them]_p14077 in the dray. Curse me, but [he]_p14078 was the strongest chap [I]_p14080 ever struck, an' [him]_p14081 a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin [you]_p14082 would think [he]_p14079 couldn't throw a shadder. ""  How this phrase thrilled through me!  ""Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like [they]_p14085 was pounds of tea, and [me]_p14083 a-puffin' an' a-blowin' afore [I]_p14086 could up-end [mine]_p14088 anyhow, an' I'm no chicken, neither. "" ""How did [you]_p14089 get into the house in [Piccadilly]_n?""1680 [I]_p14090 asked. ""He was there too. [He]_p14091 must 'a' started off and got there afore me, for when [I]_p14094 rung of the bell [he]_p14095 kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped [me]_p14092 to carry the boxes into the 'all. ""  ""The whole nine?"" [I]_p14096 asked. ""Yus there was five in the first load an' four in the second.",1,,24,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p14097 was main dry work, an' [I]_p14098 don't so well remember 'ow [I]_p14099 got 'ome. "" [I]_p14100 interrupted him:,   ""Were the boxes left in the hall?""  ""Yus [it]_p14101 was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it. "" [I]_p14103 made one more attempt to further matters:,   ""You didn't have any key?""  ""Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, [he]_p14104 opened the door 'isself an' shut [it]_p14105 again when [I]_p14106 druv off. [I]_p14107 don't remember the last time, but that was the beer. ""  ""And [you]_p14108 can't remember the number of the house?""  ""No, sir. But [ye]_p14109 needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door.

stoker_dracula," "" [I]_p14118 thought that with this description [I]_p14119 could find the house, so, having paid [my]_p14121 friend for [his]_p14122 information, [I]_p14119 started off for [Piccadilly]_n1681. [I]_p14123 had gained a new painful experience the Count could, [it]_p14124 was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was precious for, now that [he]_p14125 had achieved a certain amount of distribution, [he]_p14126 could, by choosing [his]_p14127 own time, complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus [I]_p14128 discharged [my]_p14130 cab, and walked westward beyond the Junior [Constitutional]_n1682 [I]_p14129 came across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though [it]_p14131 had been long untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. [It]_p14132 was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice-board in front of the balcony [it]_p14133 had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported [it]_p14134 still remaining. Behind the rails of the balcony [I]_p14135 saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white. [I]_p14136 would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice-board intact, as [it]_p14137 would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house.",2,,20,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14138 remembered [my]_p14141 experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and [I]_p14139 could not but feel that if [I]_p14139 could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house. There was at present nothing to be learned from the [Piccadilly]_n1683 side, and nothing could be done so [I]_p14142 went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the [Piccadilly]_n1684 houses being mostly in occupation. [I]_p14143 asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom [I]_p14144 saw around if [they]_p14145 could tell [me]_p14146 anything about the empty house. One of [them]_p14147 said that [he]_p14148 heard [it]_p14150 had lately been taken, but [he]_p14149 couldn't say from whom. [He]_p14151 told me, however, that up to very lately there had been a notice-board of ""For [Sale]_n""1685 up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell [me]_p14152 something, as [he]_p14154 thought [he]_p14155 remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board. [I]_p14156 did not wish to seem too eager, or to let [my]_p14158 informant know or guess too much, so, thanking [him]_p14159 in the usual manner, [I]_p14157 strolled away. [It]_p14160 was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so [I]_p14161 did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, [I]_p14162 was soon at [their]_p14163 office in Sackville Street. The gentleman who saw [me]_p14164 was particularly suave in manner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion.",3,,26,
stoker_dracula," Having once told [me]_p14165 that the [Piccadilly]_n1686 house, which throughout [our]_p14166 interview [he]_p14167 called a ""mansion"", was sold, [he]_p14168 considered [my]_p14169 business as concluded. When [I]_p14170 asked who had purchased it, [he]_p14171 opened [his]_p14172 eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying:,   ""It is sold, sir. ""  ""Pardon me,"" [I]_p14173 said, with equal politeness, ""but [I]_p14174 have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it. ""  Again [he]_p14175 paused longer, and raised [his]_p14176 eyebrows still more. ""It is sold, sir,"" was again [his]_p14177 laconic reply. ""Surely,"" [I]_p14178 said, ""you do not mind letting [me]_p14179 know so much. ""  ""But [I]_p14180 do mind,"" [he]_p14181 answered. ""The affairs of [their]_p14182 clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy. "" This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with him. [I]_p14183 thought [I]_p14184 had best meet [him]_p14186 on [his]_p14187 own ground, so [I]_p14184 said:,   ""Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of [their]_p14188 confidence.",1,,24,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14189 am [myself]_p14190 a professional man. "" Here [I]_p14191 handed [him]_p14192 [my]_p14193 card.

"" These words put a different complexion on affairs.

[We]_p14203 once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for [him]_p14204 when [he]_p14205 was the [Honourable]_n1689 [Arthur]_n1690 Holmwood. If [you]_p14206 will let [me]_p14207 have [his]_p14208 lordship's address [I]_p14210 will consult the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with [his]_p14209 lordship by [to-night]_n's1691 post. [It]_p14211 will be a pleasure if [we]_p14212 can so far deviate from [our]_p14213 rules as to give the required information to [his]_p14214 lordship. "" [I]_p14215 wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so [I]_p14216 thanked him, gave the address at Dr [Seward]_n's1692 and came away. [It]_p14217 was now dark, and [I]_p14218 was tired and hungry.",6,,29,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14219 got a cup of tea at the A rated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet by the next train. [I]_p14220 found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but [she]_p14221 made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, [it]_p14222 wrung [my]_p14223 heart to think that [I]_p14224 had had to keep anything from [her]_p14225 and so caused [her]_p14226 inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of [her]_p14227 looking on at [our]_p14228 conferences, and feeling the sting of [our]_p14229 not showing [our]_p14229 confidence. [It]_p14231 took all [my]_p14232 courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping [her]_p14233 out of [our]_p14234 grim task. [She]_p14235 seems somehow more reconciled or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when any accidental allusion is made [she]_p14236 actually shudders. [I]_p14237 am glad [we]_p14238 made [our]_p14239 resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, [our]_p14240 growing knowledge would be torture to her. [I]_p14241 could not tell the others of the day's discovery till [we]_p14243 were alone  so after dinner, followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves, [I]_p14242 took Mina to [her]_p14244 room and left [her]_p14245 to go to bed. The [dear]_n1693 girl was more affectionate with [me]_p14246 than ever, and clung to [me]_p14247 as though [she]_p14249 would detain [me]_p14247 but there was much to be talked of and [I]_p14250 came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us.",1,,32,
stoker_dracula," When [I]_p14251 came down again [I]_p14252 found the others all gathered round the fire in the study. In the train [I]_p14253 had written [my]_p14255 diary so far, and simply read [it]_p14257 off to [them]_p14258 as the best means of letting [them]_p14259 get abreast of [my]_p14256 own information when [I]_p14254 had finished [Van Helsing]_n1694 said:, ""This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan.

""We got into the other,"" answered [Lord]_n1695 [Godalming]_n1696 quickly. ""But, Art, this is different.

For a good while [we]_p14289 sat and smoked, discussing the matter in [its]_p14290 various lights and bearings [I]_p14291 took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment.

[His]_p14304 moods change so rapidly that [I]_p14305 find [it]_p14306 difficult to keep touch of them, and as [they]_p14307 always mean something more than [his]_p14309 own well-being, [they]_p14308 form a more than interesting study. This morning, when [I]_p14310 went to see [him]_p14311 after [his]_p14312 repulse of [Van Helsing]_n,1705 [his]_p14313 manner was that of a man commanding destiny. [He]_p14314 was, in fact, commanding destiny, subjectively. [He]_p14315 did not really care for any of the things of mere earth [he]_p14316 was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of [us]_p14317 poor mortals. [I]_p14318 thought [I]_p14319 would improve the occasion and learn something, so [I]_p14319 asked him:, ""What about the flies these times?"" [He]_p14321 smiled on [me]_p14322 in quite a superior sort of way, such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio, as [he]_p14324 answered me:, ""The fly, [my]_p14325 [dear]_n1706 sir, has one striking feature [its]_p14326 wings are typical of the a rial powers of the psychic faculties.",5,,29,

[He]_p14356 smiled with an ineffably benign superiority. ""Oh no! Far be [it]_p14357 from [me]_p14358 to arrogate to [myself]_p14359 the attributes of the Deity. [I]_p14360 am not even concerned in [His]_p14361 especially spiritual doings. If [I]_p14362 may state [my]_p14364 intellectual position [I]_p14363 am, so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied spiritually!"" This was a poser to me. [I]_p14365 could not at the moment recall Enoch's appositeness so [I]_p14366 had to ask a simple question, though [I]_p14366 felt that by so doing [I]_p14367 was lowering [myself]_p14369 in the eyes of the lunatic:,   ""And why with Enoch?""  ""Because [he]_p14370 walked with God. "" [I]_p14371 could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit [it]_p14373 so [I]_p14372 harked back to what [he]_p14374 had denied:,   ""So [you]_p14375 don't care about life and [you]_p14376 don't want souls.",0,,49,
stoker_dracula," Why not?"" [I]_p14377 put [my]_p14378 question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him. The effort succeeded for an instant [he]_p14379 unconsciously relapsed into [his]_p14381 old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon [me]_p14382 as [he]_p14380 replied:,   ""I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! [I]_p14384 don't. [I]_p14386 couldn't use [them]_p14388 if [I]_p14387 had [them]_p14389 [they]_p14390 would be no manner of use to me. [I]_p14391 couldn't eat [them]_p14392 or, , "" [He]_p14393 suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over [his]_p14394 face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. ""And doctor, as to life, what is [it]_p14395 after all? When you've got all [you]_p14396 require, and [you]_p14397 know that [you]_p14397 will never want, that is all. [I]_p14400 have friends, good friends, like you, Dr [Seward]_n""1707 this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning. ""I know that [I]_p14401 shall never lack the means of life!""  [I]_p14402 think that through the cloudiness of [his]_p14404 insanity [he]_p14405 saw some antagonism in me, for [he]_p14406 at once fell back on the last refuge of such as he, a dogged silence. After a short time [I]_p14408 saw that for the present [it]_p14409 was useless to speak to him. [He]_p14410 was sulky, and so [I]_p14411 came away. Later in the day [he]_p14412 sent for me.",1,,31,
stoker_dracula," Ordinarily [I]_p14413 would not have come without special reason, but just at present [I]_p14414 am so interested in [him]_p14416 that [I]_p14414 would gladly make an effort. Besides, [I]_p14417 am glad to have anything to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues and so are [Lord Godalming]_n1708 and [Quincey]_n1709. [Van Helsing]_n1710 sits in [my]_p14418 study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers [he]_p14419 seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details [he]_p14420 will light upon some clue. [He]_p14421 does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause. [I]_p14422 would have taken [him]_p14424 with [me]_p14425 to see the patient, only [I]_p14423 thought that after [his]_p14426 last repulse [he]_p14427 might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when [he]_p14428 and [I]_p14429 were alone. [I]_p14430 found [him]_p14431 sitting out in the middle of the floor on [his]_p14432 stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on [his]_p14433 part. When [I]_p14434 came in, [he]_p14435 said at once, as though the question had been waiting on [his]_p14436 lips:,   ""What about souls?"" [It]_p14437 was evident then that [my]_p14438 surmise had been correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing [its]_p14439 work, even with the lunatic.",3,,27,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14440 determined to have the matter out. ""What about [them]_p14441 yourself?"" [I]_p14442 asked. [He]_p14443 did not reply for a moment but looked all round him, and up and down, as though [he]_p14444 expected to find some inspiration for an answer. ""I don't want any souls!"" [he]_p14445 said in a feeble, apologetic way. The matter seemed preying on [his]_p14446 mind, and so [I]_p14447 determined to use it, to ""be cruel only to be kind. "" So [I]_p14448 said:,   ""You like life, and [you]_p14451 want life?""  ""Oh yes! but that is all right [you]_p14452 needn't worry about that!""  ""But,"" [I]_p14449 asked, ""how are [we]_p14456 to get the life without getting the soul also?"" This seemed to puzzle him, so [I]_p14449 followed [it]_p14457 up:,   ""A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you. You've got [their]_p14458 lives, [you]_p14460 know, and [you]_p14461 must put up with [their]_p14459 souls!"" Something seemed to affect [his]_p14462 imagination, for [he]_p14467 put [his]_p14463 fingers to [his]_p14463 ears and shut [his]_p14464 eyes, screwing [them]_p14468 up tightly just as a small boy does when [his]_p14464 face is being soaped. There was something pathetic in [it]_p14469 that touched [me]_p14472 [it]_p14470 also gave [me]_p14473 a lesson, for [it]_p14470 seemed that before [me]_p14473 was a child, only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. [It]_p14475 was evident that [he]_p14476 was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how [his]_p14477 past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, [I]_p14479 thought [I]_p14480 would enter into [his]_p14478 mind as well as [I]_p14480 could and go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so [I]_p14482 asked him, speaking pretty loud so that [he]_p14483 would hear [me]_p14484 through [his]_p14485 closed ears:,   ""Would [you]_p14487 like some sugar to get [your]_p14488 flies round again?"" [He]_p14489 seemed to wake up all at once, and shook [his]_p14486 head.",0,,47,
stoker_dracula," With a laugh [he]_p14490 replied:,   ""Not much! flies are poor things, after all!"" After a pause [he]_p14491 added, ""But [I]_p14492 don't want [their]_p14493 souls buzzing round me, all the same. ""  ""Or spiders?"" [I]_p14494 went on. ""Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in [them]_p14495 to eat or"", [he]_p14496 stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden topic. ""So, so!"" [I]_p14497 thought to myself, ""this is the second time [he]_p14499 has suddenly stopped at the word 'drink' what does [it]_p14501 mean?"" Renfield seemed [himself]_p14503 aware of having made a lapse, for [he]_p14500 hurried on, as though to distract [my]_p14504 attention from it:,   ""I don't take any stock at all in such matters. 'Rats and mice and such small deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken-feed of the larder' [they]_p14505 might be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense. [You]_p14506 might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to interest [me]_p14507 about the lesser carnivora, when [I]_p14509 know of what is before me. ""  ""I see,"" [I]_p14510 said. ""You want big things that [you]_p14512 can make [your]_p14515 teeth meet in? How would [you]_p14513 like to breakfast on elephant?""  ""What ridiculous nonsense [you]_p14513 are talking!"" [He]_p14516 was getting too wide awake, so [I]_p14517 thought [I]_p14518 would press [him]_p14519 hard. ""I wonder,"" [I]_p14520 said reflectively, ""what an elephant's soul is like!""  The effect [I]_p14521 desired was obtained, for [he]_p14523 at once fell from [his]_p14524 high-horse and became a child again.",0,,30,
stoker_dracula," ""I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!"" [he]_p14525 said. For a few moments [he]_p14526 sat despondently. Suddenly [he]_p14527 jumped to [his]_p14528 feet, with [his]_p14529 eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. ""To hell with [you]_p14530 and [your]_p14531 souls!"" [he]_p14532 shouted. ""Why do [you]_p14533 plague [me]_p14534 about souls? Haven't [I]_p14536 got enough to worry, and pain, and distract [me]_p14535 already, without thinking of souls!"" [He]_p14539 looked so hostile that [I]_p14537 thought [he]_p14540 was in for another homicidal fit, so [I]_p14537 blew [my]_p14541 whistle. The instant, however, that [I]_p14542 did so [he]_p14544 became calm, and said apologetically:,   ""Forgive me, Doctor [I]_p14543 forgot myself. [You]_p14545 do not need any help. [I]_p14546 am so worried in [my]_p14548 mind that [I]_p14547 am apt to be irritable. If [you]_p14549 only knew the problem [I]_p14551 have to face, and that [I]_p14552 am working out, [you]_p14550 would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put [me]_p14553 in a strait-waistcoat.",0,,29,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14554 want to think and [I]_p14555 cannot think freely when [my]_p14556 body is confined. [I]_p14557 am sure [you]_p14559 will understand!"" [He]_p14560 had evidently self-control so when the attendants came [I]_p14558 told [them]_p14561 not to mind, and [they]_p14562 withdrew. Renfield watched [them]_p14563 go when the door was closed [he]_p14564 said, with considerable dignity and sweetness:, ""Dr [Seward]_n,1711 [you]_p14565 have been very considerate towards me. Believe [me]_p14566 that [I]_p14567 am very, very grateful to you!"" [I]_p14568 thought [it]_p14570 well to leave [him]_p14571 in this mood, and so [I]_p14568 came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in this man's state. Several points seem to make what the American interviewer calls ""a story,"" if [one]_p14572 could only get [them]_p14573 in proper order. Here [they]_p14574 are:,   Will not mention ""drinking. ""  Fears the thought of being burdened with the ""soul"" of anything. Has no dread of wanting ""life"" in the future. Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though [he]_p14575 dreads being haunted by [their]_p14576 souls.",1,,23,
stoker_dracula," Logically all these things point one way! [he]_p14577 has assurance of some kind that [he]_p14578 will acquire some higher life. [He]_p14579 dreads the consequence, the burden of a soul. Then [it]_p14580 is a human life [he]_p14581 looks to!  And the assurance, ?  Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of terror afoot!  * * * * *  Later. , [I]_p14582 went after [my]_p14583 round to [Van Helsing]_n1712 and told [him]_p14585 [my]_p14584 suspicion. [He]_p14586 grew very grave and, after thinking the matter over for a while asked [me]_p14587 to take [him]_p14588 to Renfield. [I]_p14589 did so. As [we]_p14590 came to the door [we]_p14591 heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as [he]_p14592 used to do in the time which now seems so long ago. When [we]_p14593 entered [we]_p14594 saw with amazement that [he]_p14595 had spread out [his]_p14596 sugar as of old the flies, lethargic with the autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. [We]_p14597 tried to make [him]_p14598 talk of the subject of [our]_p14599 previous conversation, but [he]_p14600 would not attend. [He]_p14601 went on with [his]_p14602 singing, just as though [we]_p14603 had not been present.",1,,27,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p14604 had got a scrap of paper and was folding [it]_p14605 into a note-book. [We]_p14606 had to come away as ignorant as [we]_p14607 went in. [His]_p14608 is a curious case indeed [we]_p14609 must watch [him]_p14610 [to-night]_n1713. [Letter]_n,1714 Mitchell, Sons and Candy to [Lord Godalming]_n1715. ""1 October. ""My [Lord]_n,1716 ""We are at all times only too happy to meet [your]_p14611 wishes. [We]_p14612 beg, with regard to the desire of [your]_p14613 Lordship, expressed by Mr Harker on [your]_p14614 behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of No. 347, [Piccadilly]_n1717. The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase [himself]_p14615 paying the purchase money in notes 'over the counter,' if [your]_p14616 Lordship will pardon [us]_p14617 using so vulgar an expression.",5,,14,
stoker_dracula," Beyond this [we]_p14618 know nothing whatever of him. ""We are, [my]_p14619 [Lord]_n,1718 ""Your [Lordship]_n's1719 humble servants, ""MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY. "" [Dr Seward]_n's1720 [Diary]_n1721. 2 October. , [I]_p14620 placed a man in the corridor last night, and told [him]_p14621 to make an accurate note of any sound [he]_p14623 might hear from Renfield's room, and gave [him]_p14622 instructions that if there should be anything strange [he]_p14624 was to call me. After dinner, when [we]_p14625 had all gathered round the fire in the study, Mrs Harker having gone to bed, [we]_p14626 discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result, and [we]_p14627 are in great hopes that [his]_p14628 clue may be an important one. Before going to bed [I]_p14629 went round to the patient's room and looked in through the observation trap. [He]_p14630 was sleeping soundly, and [his]_p14631 heart rose and fell with regular respiration. This morning the man on duty reported to [me]_p14632 that a little after midnight [he]_p14633 was restless and kept saying [his]_p14634 prayers somewhat loudly.",4,,17,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14635 asked [him]_p14636 if that was all [he]_p14637 replied that [it]_p14639 was all [he]_p14638 heard. There was something about [his]_p14640 manner so suspicious that [I]_p14641 asked [him]_p14642 point blank if [he]_p14643 had been asleep. [He]_p14644 denied sleep, but admitted to having ""dozed"" for a while. [It]_p14645 is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless [they]_p14646 are watched. [To-day Harker]_n1722 is out following up [his]_p14647 clue, and Art and [Quincey]_n1723 are looking after horses. [Godalming]_n1724 thinks that [it]_p14648 will be well to have horses always in readiness, for when [we]_p14649 get the information which [we]_p14650 seek there will be no time to lose. [We]_p14651 must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset [we]_p14652 shall thus catch the Count at [his]_p14653 weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. [Van Helsing]_n1725 is off to the [British]_n1726 Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old physicians took account of things which [their]_p14654 followers do not accept, and the [Professor]_n1727 is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to [us]_p14655 later. [I]_p14656 sometimes think [we]_p14657 must be all mad and that [we]_p14658 shall wake to sanity in strait-waistcoats.",6,,24,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  Later. , [We]_p14659 have met again. [We]_p14660 seem at last to be on the track, and [our]_p14661 work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. [I]_p14662 wonder if Renfield's quiet has anything to do with this. [His]_p14663 moods have so followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to [him]_p14664 in some subtle way. If [we]_p14665 could only get some hint as to what passed in [his]_p14666 mind, between the time of [my]_p14668 argument with [him]_p14669 to-day and [his]_p14667 resumption of fly-catching, [it]_p14670 might afford [us]_p14671 a valuable clue. [He]_p14672 is now seemingly quiet for a spell. Is he?, , That wild yell seemed to come from [his]_p14673 room. * * * * *  The attendant came bursting into [my]_p14674 room and told [me]_p14675 that Renfield had somehow met with some accident. [He]_p14676 had heard [him]_p14677 yell and when [he]_p14680 went to [him]_p14678 found [him]_p14678 lying on [his]_p14681 face on the floor, all covered with blood.",0,,23,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14682 must go at once. CHAPTER XXI [DR]_n1728. SEWARD'S [DIARY]_n1729 3 October. , Let [me]_p14683 put down with exactness all that happened, as well as [I]_p14684 can remember it, since last [I]_p14685 made an entry. Not a detail that [I]_p14686 can recall must be forgotten in all calmness [I]_p14687 must proceed. When [I]_p14688 came to Renfield's room [I]_p14689 found [him]_p14690 lying on the floor on [his]_p14691 left side in a glittering pool of blood. When [I]_p14692 went to move him, [it]_p14693 became at once apparent that [he]_p14694 had received some terrible injuries  there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed [I]_p14695 could see that [it]_p14696 was horribly bruised, as though [it]_p14697 had been beaten against the floor, indeed [it]_p14697 was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to [me]_p14699 as [we]_p14700 turned [him]_p14701 over:,   ""I think, sir, [his]_p14702 back is broken. See, both [his]_p14703 right arm and leg and the whole side of [his]_p14704 face are paralysed.",2,,23,
stoker_dracula," "" How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. [He]_p14705 seemed quite bewildered, and [his]_p14706 brows were gathered in as [he]_p14707 said:,   ""I can't understand the two things. [He]_p14708 could mark [his]_p14709 face like that by beating [his]_p14710 own head on the floor. [I]_p14711 saw a [young]_n1730 woman do [it]_p14712 once at the [Eversfield Asylum]_n1731 before anyone could lay hands on her. And [I]_p14713 suppose [he]_p14714 might have broke [his]_p14716 neck by falling out of bed, if [he]_p14715 got in an awkward kink. But for the life of [me]_p14717 [I]_p14718 can't imagine how the two things occurred. If [his]_p14719 back was broke, [he]_p14722 couldn't beat [his]_p14720 head and if [his]_p14720 face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it. "" [I]_p14723 said to him:, ""Go to [Dr Van Helsing]_n,1732 and ask [him]_p14724 to kindly come here at once. [I]_p14726 want [him]_p14727 without an instant's delay. "" The man ran off, and within a few minutes the [Professor]_n,1733 in [his]_p14728 dressing gown and slippers, appeared.",4,,23,
stoker_dracula," When [he]_p14729 saw Renfield on the ground, [he]_p14730 looked keenly at [him]_p14731 a moment, and then turned to me. [I]_p14732 think [he]_p14733 recognised [my]_p14735 thought in [my]_p14736 eyes, for [he]_p14734 said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:,   ""Ah, a sad accident! [He]_p14737 will need very careful watching, and much attention. [I]_p14738 shall stay with [you]_p14740 [myself]_p14741 but [I]_p14739 shall first dress myself. If [you]_p14743 will remain [I]_p14745 shall in a few minutes join you. ""  The patient was now breathing stertorously and [it]_p14746 was easy to see that [he]_p14747 had suffered some terrible injury. [Van Helsing]_n1734 returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with [him]_p14748 a surgical case. [He]_p14749 had evidently been thinking and had [his]_p14750 mind made up for, almost before [he]_p14751 looked at the patient, [he]_p14752 whispered to me:,   ""Send the attendant away. [We]_p14753 must be alone with [him]_p14754 when [he]_p14755 becomes conscious, after the operation. "" So [I]_p14756 said:,   ""I think that will do now, Simmons. [We]_p14758 have done all that [we]_p14759 can at present.",1,,28,
stoker_dracula," [You]_p14760 had better go [your]_p14761 round, and Dr [Van Helsing]_n1735 will operate. Let [me]_p14762 know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere. ""  The man withdrew, and [we]_p14763 went into a strict examination of the patient. The wounds of the face was superficial the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The [Professor]_n1736 thought a moment and said:, ""We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of [his]_p14764 injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so [we]_p14765 must trephine at once or [it]_p14766 may be too late. "" As [he]_p14767 was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. [I]_p14768 went over and opened [it]_p14770 and found in the corridor without, [Arthur]_n1737 and [Quincey]_n1738 in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:, ""I heard [your]_p14771 man call up Dr [Van Helsing]_n1739 and tell [him]_p14772 of an accident. So [I]_p14773 woke [Quincey]_n1740 or rather called for [him]_p14774 as [he]_p14775 was not asleep.",6,,15,
stoker_dracula," Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of [us]_p14776 these times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things as [they]_p14777 have been. We'll have to look back, and forward a little more than [we]_p14778 have done. May [we]_p14779 come in?"" [I]_p14780 nodded, and held the door open till [they]_p14782 had entered then [I]_p14781 closed [it]_p14783 again. When [Quincey]_n1741 saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the floor, [he]_p14784 said softly:, ""My God! what has happened to him? [Poor]_n,1742 poor devil!"" [I]_p14788 told [him]_p14786 briefly, and added that [we]_p14789 expected [he]_p14785 would recover consciousness after the operation, for a short time, at all events. [He]_p14790 went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with [Godalming]_n1743 beside [him]_p14791 [we]_p14792 all watched in patience. ""We shall wait,"" said [Van Helsing]_n,1744 ""just long enough to fix the best spot for trephining, so that [we]_p14793 may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot for [it]_p14794 is evident that the h morrhage is increasing. ""  The minutes during which [we]_p14795 waited passed with fearful slowness. [I]_p14796 had a horrible sinking in [my]_p14798 heart, and from [Van Helsing]_n's1745 face [I]_p14797 gathered that [he]_p14799 felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. [I]_p14800 dreaded the words that Renfield might speak.",5,,24,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14801 was positively afraid to think  but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as [I]_p14802 have read of men who have heard the death-watch. The [poor]_n1746 man's breathing came in uncertain gasps. Each instant [he]_p14803 seemed as though [he]_p14804 would open [his]_p14806 eyes and speak but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and [he]_p14804 would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as [I]_p14807 was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. [I]_p14808 could almost hear the beating of [my]_p14809 own heart and the blood surging through [my]_p14810 temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became agonising. [I]_p14811 looked at [my]_p14812 companions, one after another, and saw from [their]_p14813 flushed faces and damp brows that [they]_p14814 were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous suspense over [us]_p14815 all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when [we]_p14816 should least expect it. At last there came a time when [it]_p14817 was evident that the patient was sinking fast [he]_p14818 might die at any moment. [I]_p14819 looked up at the [Professor]_n1747 and caught [his]_p14820 eyes fixed on mine.",2,,20,
stoker_dracula," [His]_p14821 face was sternly set as [he]_p14822 spoke:,   ""There is no time to lose. [His]_p14823 words may be worth many lives [I]_p14824 have been thinking so, as [I]_p14825 stood here. [It]_p14826 may be there is a soul at stake! [We]_p14827 shall operate just above the ear. ""  Without another word [he]_p14828 made the operation. For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so prolonged that [it]_p14829 seemed as though [it]_p14830 would tear open [his]_p14831 chest. Suddenly [his]_p14832 eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments then [it]_p14833 softened into a glad surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. [He]_p14834 moved convulsively, and as [he]_p14835 did so, said:,   ""I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell [them]_p14836 to take off the strait-waistcoat.",0,,16,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p14837 have had a terrible dream, and [it]_p14839 has left [me]_p14840 so weak that [I]_p14838 cannot move. What's wrong with [my]_p14841 face? [it]_p14842 feels all swollen, and [it]_p14843 smarts dreadfully. "" [He]_p14844 tried to turn [his]_p14845 head but even with the effort [his]_p14846 eyes seemed to grow glassy again so [I]_p14847 gently put [it]_p14848 back. Then [Van Helsing]_n1748 said in a quiet grave tone:, ""Tell [us]_p14849 [your]_p14850 dream, [Mr Renfield]_n1749. "" As [he]_p14851 heard the voice [his]_p14853 face brightened, through [its]_p14854 mutilation, and [he]_p14852 said:, ""That is Dr [Van Helsing]_n1750. How good [it]_p14855 is of [you]_p14856 to be here. Give [me]_p14857 some water, [my]_p14858 lips are dry and [I]_p14859 shall try to tell you. [I]_p14860 dreamed"", [he]_p14862 stopped and seemed fainting, [I]_p14861 called quietly to [Quincey]_n,1751 ""The brandy, [it]_p14863 is in [my]_p14864 study, quick!"" [He]_p14865 flew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. [We]_p14866 moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived. [It]_p14867 seemed, however, that [his]_p14868 poor injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when [he]_p14869 was quite conscious, [he]_p14870 looked at [me]_p14871 piercingly with an agonised confusion which [I]_p14872 shall never forget, and said:,   ""I must not deceive [myself]_p14874 [it]_p14875 was no dream, but all a grim reality.",4,,38,
stoker_dracula," "" Then [his]_p14876 eyes roved round the room as [they]_p14877 caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed [he]_p14878 went on:,   ""If [I]_p14879 were not sure already, [I]_p14880 would know from them. "" For an instant [his]_p14881 eyes closed, not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though [he]_p14883 were bringing all [his]_p14882 faculties to bear when [he]_p14884 opened [them]_p14887 [he]_p14884 said, hurriedly, and with more energy than [he]_p14885 had yet displayed:,   ""Quick, Doctor, quick. [I]_p14888 am dying! [I]_p14889 feel that [I]_p14889 have but a few minutes  and then [I]_p14890 must go back to death, or worse! Wet [my]_p14892 lips with brandy again. [I]_p14893 have something that [I]_p14894 must say before [I]_p14894 die or before [my]_p14896 [poor]_n1752 crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! [It]_p14900 was that night after [you]_p14897 left me, when [I]_p14903 implored [you]_p14898 to let [me]_p14901 go away. [I]_p14904 couldn't speak then, for [I]_p14905 felt [my]_p14908 tongue was tied but [I]_p14905 was as sane then, except in that way, as [I]_p14906 am now. [I]_p14909 was in an agony of despair for a long time after [you]_p14910 left [me]_p14911 [it]_p14912 seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. [My]_p14913 brain seemed to become cool again, and [I]_p14914 realised where [I]_p14915 was. [I]_p14916 heard the dogs bark behind [our]_p14917 house, but not where [He]_p14918 was!"" As [he]_p14919 spoke, [Van Helsing]_n's1753 eyes never blinked, but [his]_p14920 hand came out and met [mine]_p14921 and gripped [it]_p14922 hard.",2,,45,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p14923 did not, however, betray [himself]_p14924 [he]_p14925 nodded slightly and said: ""Go on,"" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:,   ""He came up to the window in the mist, as [I]_p14926 had seen [him]_p14927 often before  but [he]_p14928 was solid then, not a ghost, and [his]_p14929 eyes were fierce like a man's when angry. [He]_p14930 was laughing with [his]_p14931 red mouth the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when [he]_p14932 turned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking. [I]_p14933 wouldn't ask [him]_p14935 to come in at first, though [I]_p14934 knew [he]_p14936 wanted to, just as [he]_p14937 had wanted all along. Then [he]_p14938 began promising [me]_p14939 things, not in words but by doing them. "" [He]_p14940 was interrupted by a word from the [Professor]_n:,1754 ""How?"" ""By making [them]_p14941 happen just as [he]_p14942 used to send in the flies when the sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on [their]_p14943 wings and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on [their]_p14944 backs. "" [Van Helsing]_n1755 nodded to [him]_p14945 as [he]_p14946 whispered to [me]_p14947 unconsciously:, ""The Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges, what [you]_p14948 call the 'Death's-head Moth'?"" The patient went on without stopping. ""Then [he]_p14949 began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a life and dogs to eat them, and cats too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in [it]_p14950 and not merely buzzing flies!' [I]_p14951 laughed at him, for [I]_p14952 wanted to see what [he]_p14953 could do.",2,,31,
stoker_dracula," Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in [His]_p14954 house. [He]_p14955 beckoned [me]_p14956 to the window. [I]_p14957 got up and looked out, and [He]_p14958 raised [his]_p14959 hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire and then [He]_p14960 moved the mist to the right and left, and [I]_p14961 could see that there were thousands of rats with [their]_p14962 eyes blazing red, like His, only smaller. [He]_p14963 held up [his]_p14965 hand, and [they]_p14966 all stopped and [I]_p14967 thought [he]_p14972 seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will [I]_p14968 give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if [you]_p14973 will fall down and worship me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over [my]_p14977 eyes and before [I]_p14968 knew what [I]_p14969 was doing, [I]_p14969 found [myself]_p14978 opening the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were all gone, but [He]_p14964 slid into the room through the sash, though [it]_p14979 was only open an inch wide, just as the Moon [herself]_p14980 has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before [me]_p14975 in all [her]_p14981 size and splendour. ""  [His]_p14982 voice was weaker, so [I]_p14983 moistened [his]_p14984 lips with the brandy again, and [he]_p14987 continued but [it]_p14988 seemed as though [his]_p14985 memory had gone on working in the interval for [his]_p14985 story was further advanced. [I]_p14989 was about to call [him]_p14990 back to the point, but [Van Helsing]_n1756 whispered to me: ""Let [him]_p14991 go on. Do not interrupt [him]_p14992 [he]_p14993 cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once [he]_p14994 lost the thread of [his]_p14995 thought. "" [He]_p14996 proceeded:,   ""All day [I]_p14997 waited to hear from him, but [he]_p14999 did not send [me]_p15000 anything, not even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up [I]_p14998 was pretty angry with him. When [he]_p15001 slid in through the window, though [it]_p15002 was shut, and did not even knock, [I]_p15003 got mad with him.",1,,48,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p15004 sneered at me, and [his]_p15005 white face looked out of the mist with [his]_p15006 red eyes gleaming, and [he]_p15007 went on as though [he]_p15008 owned the whole place, and [I]_p15009 was no one. [He]_p15010 didn't even smell the same as [he]_p15011 went by me. [I]_p15012 couldn't hold him. [I]_p15013 thought that, somehow, [Mrs Harker]_n1757 had come into the room. ""  The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind [him]_p15014 so that [he]_p15015 could not see them, but where [they]_p15016 could hear better. [They]_p15017 were both silent, but the [Professor]_n1758 started and quivered [his]_p15018 face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without noticing:,   ""When Mrs Harker came in to see [me]_p15019 this afternoon [she]_p15020 wasn't the same  [it]_p15021 was like tea after the teapot had been watered. "" Here [we]_p15022 all moved, but no one said a word [he]_p15023 went on:,   ""I didn't know that [she]_p15024 was here till [she]_p15025 spoke and [she]_p15025 didn't look the same. [I]_p15027 don't care for the pale people [I]_p15028 like [them]_p15029 with lots of blood in them, and [hers]_p15031 had all seemed to have run out. [I]_p15032 didn't think of [it]_p15034 at the time but when [she]_p15036 went away [I]_p15033 began to think, and [it]_p15035 made [me]_p15037 mad to know that [He]_p15038 had been taking the life out of her.",2,,34,
stoker_dracula," "" [I]_p15039 could feel that the rest quivered, as [I]_p15040 did, but [we]_p15041 remained otherwise still. ""So when [He]_p15042 came [to-night]_n1759 [I]_p15043 was ready for [Him]_n1760. [I]_p15044 saw the mist stealing in, and [I]_p15045 grabbed [it]_p15046 tight. [I]_p15047 had heard that madmen have unnatural strength and as [I]_p15048 knew [I]_p15048 was a madman, at times anyhow, [I]_p15049 resolved to use [my]_p15051 power. Ay, and [He]_p15052 felt [it]_p15054 too, for [He]_p15053 had to come out of the mist to struggle with me. [I]_p15055 held tight and [I]_p15056 thought [I]_p15056 was going to win, for [I]_p15057 didn't mean [[Him]_n]_p150601761 to take any more of [her]_p15061 life, till [I]_p15057 saw [His]_p15062 eyes. [They]_p15063 burned into me, and [my]_p15064 strength became like water. [He]_p15065 slipped through it, and when [I]_p15067 tried to cling to [Him]_n,1762 [He]_p15066 raised [me]_p15068 up and flung [me]_p15069 down. There was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away under the door. "" [His]_p15070 voice was becoming fainter and [his]_p15071 breath more stertorous.",4,,33,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n1763 stood up instinctively. ""We know the worst now,"" [he]_p15072 said. ""He is here, and [we]_p15073 know [his]_p15074 purpose. [It]_p15075 may not be too late. Let [us]_p15076 be armed, the same as [we]_p15077 were the other night, but lose no time there is not an instant to spare. "" There was no need to put [our]_p15078 fear, [nay]_n1764 [our]_p15079 conviction, into words, [we]_p15080 shared [them]_p15081 in common. [We]_p15082 all hurried and took from [our]_p15083 rooms the same things that [we]_p15084 had when [we]_p15085 entered the Count's house. The [Professor]_n1765 had [his]_p15086 ready, and as [we]_p15087 met in the corridor [he]_p15088 pointed to [them]_p15090 significantly as [he]_p15089 said:, ""They never leave [me]_p15091 and [they]_p15092 shall not till this unhappy business is over. Be wise also, [my]_p15093 friends. [It]_p15094 is no common enemy that [we]_p15095 deal with.",3,,24,
stoker_dracula," Alas! alas! that that [dear Madam Mina]_n1766 should suffer!"" [He]_p15096 stopped [his]_p15097 voice was breaking, and [I]_p15098 do not know if rage or terror predominated in [my]_p15099 own heart. Outside the Harkers' door [we]_p15100 paused. [Art]_n1767 and [Quincey]_n1768 held back, and the latter said:, ""Should [we]_p15101 disturb her?"" ""We must,"" said [Van Helsing]_n1769 grimly. ""If the door be locked, [I]_p15102 shall break [it]_p15103 in. "" ""May [it]_p15104 not frighten [her]_p15105 terribly? [It]_p15106 is unusual to break into a lady's room!"" [Van Helsing]_n1770 said solemnly, ""You are always right but this is life and death. All chambers are alike to the doctor and even were [they]_p15107 not [they]_p15108 are all as one to [me]_p15109 [to-night]_n1771. [Friend John]_n,1772 when [I]_p15110 turn the handle, if the door does not open, do [you]_p15111 put [your]_p15113 shoulder down and shove and [you]_p15112 too, [my]_p15114 friends. Now!""  [He]_p15115 turned the handle as [he]_p15116 spoke, but the door did not yield. [We]_p15117 threw [ourselves]_p15118 against [it]_p15119 with a crash [it]_p15120 burst open, and [we]_p15121 almost fell headlong into the room. The [Professor]_n1773 did actually fall, and [I]_p15122 saw across [him]_p15123 as [he]_p15124 gathered [himself]_p15125 up from hands and knees.",8,,30,
stoker_dracula," What [I]_p15126 saw appalled me. [I]_p15127 felt [my]_p15128 hair rise like bristles on the back of [my]_p15129 neck, and [my]_p15129 heart seemed to stand still. The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, [his]_p15131 face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of [his]_p15132 wife. By [her]_p15133 side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black. [His]_p15134 face was turned from us, but the instant [we]_p15135 saw [we]_p15136 all recognised the Count, in every way, even to the scar on [his]_p15137 forehead. With [his]_p15138 left hand [he]_p15141 held both Mrs Harker's hands, keeping [them]_p15142 away with [her]_p15143 arms at full tension [his]_p15139 right hand gripped [her]_p15144 by the back of the neck, forcing [her]_p15144 face down on [his]_p15139 bosom. [Her]_p15146 white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which was shown by [his]_p15147 torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel [it]_p15148 to drink.",0,,23,
stoker_dracula," As [we]_p15149 burst into the room, the Count turned [his]_p15150 face, and the hellish look that [I]_p15151 had heard described seemed to leap into it. [His]_p15152 eyes flamed red with devilish passion the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw [his]_p15153 victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, [he]_p15154 turned and sprang at us. But by this time the [Professor]_n1774 had gained [his]_p15155 feet, and was holding towards [him]_p15156 the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back [he]_p15157 cowered, as we, lifting [our]_p15158 crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky and when the gaslight sprang up under [Quincey]_n's1775 match, [we]_p15159 saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as [we]_p15160 looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from [its]_p15161 bursting open, had swung back to [its]_p15162 old position. [Van Helsing]_n,1776 Art, and [I]_p15163 moved forward to Mrs Harker, who by this time had drawn [her]_p15164 breath and with [it]_p15165 had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that [it]_p15166 seems to [me]_p15168 now that [it]_p15166 will ring in [my]_p15169 ears till [my]_p15170 dying day. For a few seconds [she]_p15171 lay in [her]_p15172 helpless attitude and disarray.",3,,24,
stoker_dracula," [Her]_p15173 face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared [her]_p15174 lips and cheeks and chin from [her]_p15175 throat trickled a thin stream of blood [her]_p15175 eyes were mad with terror. Then [she]_p15177 put before [her]_p15178 face [her]_p15179 poor crushed hands, which bore on [their]_p15180 whiteness the red mark of the Count's terrible grip, and from behind [them]_p15181 came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. [Van Helsing]_n1777 stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over [her]_p15182 body, whilst Art, after looking at [her]_p15183 face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room. [Van Helsing]_n1778 whispered to me:, ""[Jonathan]_n1779 is in a stupor such as [we]_p15184 know the [Vampire]_n1780 can produce. [We]_p15185 can do nothing with poor [Madam]_n1781 Mina for a few moments till [she]_p15186 recovers [herself]_p15187 [I]_p15188 must wake him!"" [He]_p15191 dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with [it]_p15192 began to flick [him]_p15189 on the face, [his]_p15193 wife all the while holding [her]_p15194 face between [her]_p15195 hands and sobbing in a way that was heart-breaking to hear. [I]_p15196 raised the blind, and looked out of the window. There was much moonshine and as [I]_p15197 looked [I]_p15198 could see [Quincey]_n1782 Morris run across the lawn and hide [himself]_p15199 in the shadow of a great yew-tree. [It]_p15200 puzzled [me]_p15201 to think why [he]_p15202 was doing this but at the instant [I]_p15204 heard Harker's quick exclamation as [he]_p15203 woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the bed. On [his]_p15205 face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement. [He]_p15206 seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon [him]_p15207 all at once, and [he]_p15208 started up.",6,,35,
stoker_dracula," [His]_p15209 wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to [him]_p15210 with [her]_p15212 arms stretched out, as though to embrace [him]_p15211 instantly, however, [she]_p15217 drew [them]_p15218 in again, and putting [her]_p15213 elbows together, held [her]_p15213 hands before [her]_p15214 face, and shuddered till the bed beneath [her]_p15214 shook. ""In God's name what does this mean?"" Harker cried out. ""Dr [Seward]_n,1783 Dr [Van Helsing]_n,1784 what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, [dear]_n,1785 what is it? What does that blood mean? [My]_p15222 God, [my]_p15223 God! has [it]_p15219 come to this!"" and, raising [himself]_p15224 to [his]_p15225 knees, [he]_p15227 beat [his]_p15226 hands wildly together. ""Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!"" With a quick movement [he]_p15228 jumped from bed, and began to pull on [his]_p15229 clothes,, all the man in [him]_p15230 awake at the need for instant exertion. ""What has happened? Tell [me]_p15231 all about it!"" [he]_p15232 cried without pausing. ""[Dr Van Helsing]_n,1786 [you]_p15233 love [Mina]_n,1787 [I]_p15234 know. Oh, do something to [save]_n1788 her. [It]_p15235 cannot have gone too far yet. Guard [her]_p15236 while [I]_p15239 look for him!"" [His]_p15243 wife, through [her]_p15237 terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly forgetting [her]_p15237 own grief, [she]_p15244 seized hold of [him]_p15240 and cried out:,   ""No! no! Jonathan, [you]_p15245 must not leave me. [I]_p15246 have suffered enough [to-night]_n,1789 God knows, without the dread of [his]_p15247 harming you.",7,,35,
stoker_dracula," [You]_p15248 must stay with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!"" [Her]_p15249 expression became frantic as [she]_p15250 spoke and, [he]_p15252 yielding to her, [she]_p15251 pulled [him]_p15253 down sitting on the bed side, and clung to [him]_p15254 fiercely. [Van Helsing]_n1790 and [I]_p15255 tried to calm [them]_p15256 both. The [Professor]_n1791 held up [his]_p15257 little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:, ""Do not fear, [my]_p15258 [dear]_n1792. [We]_p15259 are here and whilst this is close to [you]_p15260 no foul thing can approach. [You]_p15261 are safe for [to-night]_n1793 and [we]_p15262 must be calm and take counsel together. "" [She]_p15263 shuddered and was silent, holding down [her]_p15264 head on [her]_p15265 husband's breast. When [she]_p15266 raised it, [his]_p15267 white night-robe was stained with blood where [her]_p15268 lips had touched, and where the thin open wound in [her]_p15269 neck had sent forth drops. The instant [she]_p15270 saw [it]_p15272 [she]_p15271 drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs:,   ""Unclean, unclean! [I]_p15273 must touch [him]_p15274 or kiss [him]_p15275 no more. Oh, that [it]_p15276 should be that [it]_p15277 is [I]_p15278 who am now [his]_p15279 worst enemy, and whom [he]_p15280 may have most cause to fear.",4,,33,
stoker_dracula," "" To this [he]_p15281 spoke out resolutely:,   ""Nonsense, Mina. [It]_p15282 is a shame to [me]_p15283 to hear such a word. [I]_p15284 would not hear [it]_p15286 of [you]_p15288 and [I]_p15285 shall not hear [it]_p15287 from you. May God judge [me]_p15290 by [my]_p15292 deserts, and punish [me]_p15291 with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of [mine]_p15293 anything ever come between us!"" [He]_p15294 put out [his]_p15295 arms and folded [her]_p15297 to [his]_p15296 breast and for a while [she]_p15298 lay there sobbing. [He]_p15299 looked at [us]_p15300 over [her]_p15301 bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above [his]_p15302 quivering nostrils [his]_p15303 mouth was set as steel. After a while [her]_p15304 sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then [he]_p15305 said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which [I]_p15308 felt tried [his]_p15309 nervous power to the utmost:, ""And now, Dr [Seward]_n,1794 tell [me]_p15306 all about it. Too well [I]_p15310 know the broad fact tell [me]_p15311 all that has been. "" [I]_p15312 told [him]_p15314 exactly what had happened, and [he]_p15315 listened with seeming impassiveness but [his]_p15316 nostrils twitched and [his]_p15317 eyes blazed as [I]_p15313 told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held [his]_p15317 wife in that terrible and horrid position, with [her]_p15320 mouth to the open wound in [his]_p15318 breast. [It]_p15321 interested me, even at that moment, to see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair. Just as [I]_p15322 had finished, [Quincey]_n1795 and [Godalming]_n1796 knocked at the door.",3,,40,
stoker_dracula," [They]_p15323 entered in obedience to [our]_p15324 summons. [Van Helsing]_n1797 looked at [me]_p15325 questioningly. [I]_p15326 understood [him]_p15327 to mean if [we]_p15329 were to take advantage of [their]_p15330 coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from [themselves]_p15331 so on nodding acquiescence to [him]_p15328 [he]_p15332 asked [them]_p15333 what [they]_p15334 had seen or done. To which [Lord Godalming]_n1798 answered:, ""I could not see [him]_p15335 anywhere in the passage, or in any of [our]_p15336 rooms. [I]_p15337 looked in the study but, though [he]_p15338 had been there, [he]_p15339 had gone. [He]_p15340 had, however, , "" [He]_p15341 stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed. [Van Helsing]_n1799 said gravely:, ""Go on, friend [Arthur]_n1800. [We]_p15342 want here no more concealments. [Our]_p15343 hope now is in knowing all. Tell freely!"" So Art went on:,   ""He had been there, and though [it]_p15344 could only have been for a few seconds, [he]_p15345 made rare hay of the place.",4,,23,
stoker_dracula," All the manuscript had been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes the cylinders of [your]_p15346 phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax had helped the flames. "" Here [I]_p15347 interrupted. ""Thank God there is the other copy in the safe!"" [His]_p15348 face lit for a moment, but fell again as [he]_p15349 went on: ""I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. [I]_p15350 looked into Renfield's room but there was no trace there except, , !"" Again [he]_p15351 paused. ""Go on,"" said Harker hoarsely so [he]_p15352 bowed [his]_p15353 head and moistening [his]_p15354 lips with [his]_p15354 tongue, added: ""except that the poor fellow is dead. "" [Mrs Harker]_n1801 raised [her]_p15356 head, looking from one to the other of [us]_p15357 [she]_p15358 said solemnly:, ""God's will be done!"" [I]_p15359 could not but feel that Art was keeping back something but, as [I]_p15360 took [it]_p15362 that [it]_p15363 was with a purpose, [I]_p15360 said nothing. [Van Helsing]_n1802 turned to Morris and asked:, ""And you, friend [Quincey]_n,1803 have [you]_p15364 any to tell?"" ""A little,"" [he]_p15366 answered. ""It may be much eventually, but at present [I]_p15367 can't say. [I]_p15368 thought [it]_p15369 well to know if possible where the Count would go when [he]_p15370 left the house. [I]_p15371 did not see [him]_p15373 but [I]_p15372 saw a bat rise from Renfield's window, and flap westward.",3,,27,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p15374 expected to see [him]_p15375 in some shape go back to Carfax but [he]_p15376 evidently sought some other lair. [He]_p15377 will not be back [to-night]_n1804 for the sky is reddening in the east, and the dawn is close. [We]_p15378 must work [to-morrow]_n!""1805 [He]_p15379 said the latter words through [his]_p15380 shut teeth. For a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and [I]_p15381 could fancy that [I]_p15382 could hear the sound of [our]_p15383 hearts beating then [Van Helsing]_n1806 said, placing [his]_p15384 hand very tenderly on Mrs Harker's head:, ""And now, [Madam]_n1807 Mina, poor, [dear]_n,1808 [[dear]_n1809 [Madam]_n1810 Mina]_n,1811 tell [us]_p15385 exactly what happened. God knows that [I]_p15386 do not want that [you]_p15387 be pained but [it]_p15388 is need that [we]_p15389 know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to [us]_p15390 that must end all, if [it]_p15391 may be so and now is the chance that [we]_p15392 may live and learn. "" The poor, [dear]_n1812 lady shivered, and [I]_p15393 could see the tension of [her]_p15394 nerves as [she]_p15398 clasped [her]_p15395 husband closer to [her]_p15395 and bent [her]_p15396 head lower and lower still on [his]_p15399 breast. Then [she]_p15400 raised [her]_p15401 head proudly, and held out one hand to [Van Helsing]_n1813 who took [it]_p15402 in his, and, after stooping and kissing [it]_p15403 reverently, held [it]_p15403 fast. The other hand was locked in that of [her]_p15405 husband, who held [his]_p15407 other arm thrown round [her]_p15406 protectingly.",10,,34,
stoker_dracula," After a pause in which [she]_p15408 was evidently ordering [her]_p15410 thoughts, [she]_p15409 began:,   ""I took the sleeping draught which [you]_p15411 had so kindly given me, but for a long time [it]_p15412 did not act. [I]_p15413 seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon [my]_p15414 mind, all of [them]_p15415 connected with death, and vampires with blood, and pain, and trouble. "" [Her]_p15416 husband involuntarily groaned as [she]_p15417 turned to [him]_p15418 and said lovingly: ""Do not fret, [dear]_n1814. [You]_p15419 must be brave and strong, and help [me]_p15420 through the horrible task. If [you]_p15421 only knew what an effort [it]_p15423 is to [me]_p15424 to tell of this fearful thing at all, [you]_p15422 would understand how much [I]_p15425 need [your]_p15426 help. Well, [I]_p15427 saw [I]_p15428 must try to help the medicine to [its]_p15430 work with [my]_p15431 will, if [it]_p15432 was to do [me]_p15433 any good, so [I]_p15428 resolutely set [myself]_p15434 to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for [I]_p15435 remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for [he]_p15436 lay by [my]_p15437 side when next [I]_p15438 remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that [I]_p15439 had before noticed. But [I]_p15440 forget now if [you]_p15442 know of this [you]_p15443 will find [it]_p15445 in [my]_p15446 diary which [I]_p15441 shall show [you]_p15443 later.",1,,39,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p15447 felt the same vague terror which had come to [me]_p15448 before and the same sense of some presence. [I]_p15449 turned to wake Jonathan, but found that [he]_p15451 slept so soundly that [it]_p15453 seemed as if [it]_p15454 was [he]_p15452 who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. [I]_p15455 tried, but [I]_p15456 could not wake him. This caused [me]_p15457 a great fear, and [I]_p15458 looked around terrified. Then indeed, [my]_p15459 heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if [he]_p15460 had stepped out of the mist, or rather as if the mist had turned into [his]_p15461 figure, for [it]_p15462 had entirely disappeared, stood a tall, thin man, all in black. [I]_p15463 knew [him]_p15464 at once from the description of the others. The waxen face the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between and the red eyes that [I]_p15465 had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of [St]_n1815. Mary's [Church]_n1816 at [Whitby]_n1817. [I]_p15466 knew, too, the red scar on [his]_p15467 forehead where [Jonathan]_n1818 had struck him. For an instant [my]_p15468 heart stood still, and [I]_p15469 would have screamed out, only that [I]_p15470 was paralysed.",4,,23,
stoker_dracula," In the pause [he]_p15471 spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as [he]_p15472 spoke to Jonathan:,   ""'Silence! If [you]_p15473 make a sound [I]_p15474 shall take [him]_p15475 and dash [his]_p15476 brains out before [your]_p15477 very eyes. ' [I]_p15478 was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking smile, [he]_p15479 placed one hand upon [my]_p15481 shoulder and, holding [me]_p15484 tight, bared [my]_p15482 throat with the other, saying as [he]_p15480 did so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward [my]_p15482 exertions. [You]_p15485 may as well be quiet [it]_p15486 is not the first time, or the second, that [your]_p15487 veins have appeased [my]_p15488 thirst!' [I]_p15489 was bewildered, and, strangely enough, [I]_p15490 did not want to hinder him. [I]_p15491 suppose [it]_p15492 is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when [his]_p15493 touch is on [his]_p15494 victim. And oh, [my]_p15495 God, [my]_p15496 God, pity me! [He]_p15498 placed [his]_p15499 reeking lips upon [my]_p15496 throat!"" [Her]_p15500 husband groaned again. [She]_p15501 clasped [his]_p15502 hand harder, and looked at [him]_p15503 pityingly, as if [he]_p15504 were the injured one, and went on:,   ""I felt [my]_p15507 strength fading away, and [I]_p15505 was in a half swoon. How long this horrible thing lasted [I]_p15508 know not but [it]_p15509 seemed that a long time must have passed before [he]_p15510 took [his]_p15511 foul, awful, sneering mouth away. [I]_p15512 saw [it]_p15513 drip with the fresh blood!"" The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her, and [she]_p15516 drooped and would have sunk down but for [her]_p15514 husband's sustaining arm. With a great effort [she]_p15517 recovered [herself]_p15518 and went on:,   ""Then [he]_p15519 spoke to [me]_p15520 mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play [your]_p15521 brains against mine.",0,,49,
stoker_dracula," [You]_p15522 would help these men to hunt [me]_p15524 and frustrate [me]_p15525 in [my]_p15526 designs! [You]_p15523 know now, and [they]_p15528 know in part already, and will know in full before long, what [it]_p15529 is to cross [my]_p15527 path. [They]_p15530 should have kept [their]_p15531 energies for use closer to home. Whilst [they]_p15532 played wits against me, against [me]_p15534 who commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before [they]_p15533 were born, [I]_p15536 was countermining them. And you, [their]_p15537 best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of [my]_p15538 flesh blood of [my]_p15539 blood kin of [my]_p15539 kin [my]_p15540 bountiful wine-press for a while and shall be later on [my]_p15540 companion and [my]_p15540 helper. [You]_p15544 shall be avenged in turn for not one of [them]_p15545 but shall minister to [your]_p15546 needs. But as yet [you]_p15547 are to be punished for what [you]_p15548 have done. [You]_p15549 have aided in thwarting [me]_p15550 now [you]_p15551 shall come to [my]_p15552 call. When [my]_p15553 brain says ""Come!"" to you, [you]_p15555 shall cross land or sea to do [my]_p15554 bidding and to that end this!' With that [he]_p15557 pulled open [his]_p15558 shirt, and with [his]_p15559 long sharp nails opened a vein in [his]_p15559 breast. When the blood began to spurt out, [he]_p15561 took [my]_p15562 hands in one of his, holding [them]_p15568 tight, and with the other seized [my]_p15563 neck and pressed [my]_p15563 mouth to the wound, so that [I]_p15569 must either suffocate or swallow some of the, , Oh [my]_p15564 God! [my]_p15564 God! what have [I]_p15570 done? What have [I]_p15570 done to deserve such a fate, [I]_p15571 who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all [my]_p15564 days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril and in mercy pity those to whom [she]_p15573 is [dear]_n!""1819 Then [she]_p15574 began to rub [her]_p15575 lips as though to cleanse [them]_p15576 from pollution.",1,,53,
stoker_dracula," As [she]_p15577 was telling [her]_p15578 terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken, and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet  but over [his]_p15579 face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair. [We]_p15580 have arranged that one of [us]_p15581 is to stay within call of the unhappy pair till [we]_p15582 can meet together and arrange about taking action. Of this [I]_p15583 am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in all the great round of [its]_p15584 daily course. CHAPTER XXII [JONATHAN HARKER]_n'S1820 JOURNAL 3 October. , As [I]_p15585 must do something or go mad, [I]_p15586 write this diary. [It]_p15587 is now six o'clock, and [we]_p15588 are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat for [Dr Van Helsing]_n1821 and [Dr Seward]_n1822 are agreed that if [we]_p15589 do not eat [we]_p15589 cannot work [our]_p15591 best. [Our]_p15592 best will be, God knows, required to-day. [I]_p15593 must keep writing at every chance, for [I]_p15594 dare not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down perhaps at the end the little things may teach [us]_p15595 most.",3,,19,
stoker_dracula," The teaching, big or little, could not have landed Mina or [me]_p15596 anywhere worse than [we]_p15597 are to-day. However, [we]_p15598 must trust and hope. [Poor]_n1823 Mina told [me]_p15599 just now, with the tears running down [her]_p15600 [dear]_n1824 cheeks, that [it]_p15601 is in trouble and trial that [our]_p15602 faith is tested, that [we]_p15603 must keep on trusting and that God will aid [us]_p15604 up to the end. The end! oh [my]_p15605 God! what end?. To work! To work! When Dr [Van Helsing]_n1825 and Dr [Seward]_n1826 had come back from seeing poor Renfield, [we]_p15606 went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr [Seward]_n1827 told [us]_p15607 that when [he]_p15608 and Dr [Van Helsing]_n1828 had gone down to the room below [they]_p15609 had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. [His]_p15610 face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken. Dr [Seward]_n1829 asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if [he]_p15611 had heard anything. [He]_p15612 said that [he]_p15613 had been sitting down, [he]_p15614 confessed to half dozing, when [he]_p15614 heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield had called out loudly several times, ""God! God! God!"" after that there was a sound of falling, and when [he]_p15615 entered the room [he]_p15615 found [him]_p15618 lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. [Van Helsing]_n1830 asked if [he]_p15620 had heard ""voices"" or ""a voice,"" and [he]_p15621 said [he]_p15621 could not say that at first [it]_p15623 had seemed to [him]_p15625 as if there were two, but as there was no one in the room [it]_p15624 could have been only one.",8,,29,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p15626 could swear to it, if required, that the word ""God"" was spoken by the patient. Dr [Seward]_n1831 said to us, when [we]_p15627 were alone, that [he]_p15628 did not wish to go into the matter the question of an inquest had to be considered, and [it]_p15629 would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As [it]_p15631 was, [he]_p15632 thought that on the attendant's evidence [he]_p15633 could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result. When the question began to be discussed as to what should be [our]_p15634 next step, the very first thing [we]_p15635 decided was that Mina should be in full confidence that nothing of any sort, no matter how painful, should be kept from her. [She]_p15636 [herself]_p15637 agreed as to [its]_p15638 wisdom, and [it]_p15639 was pitiful to see [her]_p15640 so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of despair. ""There must be no concealment,"" [she]_p15641 said, ""Alas! [we]_p15642 have had too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give [me]_p15643 more pain than [I]_p15645 have already endured, than [I]_p15646 suffer now! Whatever may happen, [it]_p15647 must be of new hope or of new courage to me!"" [Van Helsing]_n1832 was looking at [her]_p15648 fixedly as [she]_p15650 spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly:, ""But [dear Madam Mina]_n,1833 are [you]_p15653 not afraid not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened?"" [Her]_p15654 face grew set in [its]_p15655 lines, but [her]_p15649 eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as [she]_p15651 answered:, ""Ah no! for [my]_p15656 mind is made up!"" ""To what?"" [he]_p15657 asked gently, whilst [we]_p15658 were all very still for each in [our]_p15660 own way [we]_p15659 had a sort of vague idea of what [she]_p15651 meant. [Her]_p15661 answer came with direct simplicity, as though [she]_p15662 were simply stating a fact:,   ""Because if [I]_p15663 find in myself, and [I]_p15664 shall watch keenly for it, a sign of harm to any that [I]_p15664 love, [I]_p15665 shall die!""  ""You would not kill yourself?"" [he]_p15667 asked, hoarsely. ""I would if there were no friend who loved me, who would save [me]_p15668 such a pain, and so desperate an effort!"" [She]_p15670 looked at [him]_p15671 meaningly as [she]_p15672 spoke.",3,,44,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p15673 was sitting down but now [he]_p15674 rose and came close to [her]_p15676 and put [his]_p15678 hand on [her]_p15677 head as [he]_p15675 said solemnly:  ""My child, there is such an one if [it]_p15679 were for [your]_p15680 good. For [myself]_p15681 [I]_p15682 could hold [it]_p15683 in [my]_p15685 account with God to find such an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if [it]_p15684 were best. Nay, were [it]_p15686 safe! But [my]_p15688 child, , "" For a moment [he]_p15689 seemed choked, and a great sob rose in [his]_p15691 throat [he]_p15690 gulped [it]_p15687 down and went on:,   ""There are here some who would stand between [you]_p15692 and death. [You]_p15693 must not die. [You]_p15694 must not die by any hand but least of all by [your]_p15695 own. Until the other, who has fouled [your]_p15696 sweet life, is true dead [you]_p15698 must not die for if [he]_p15700 is still with the quick [Un-Dead]_n,1834 [your]_p15697 death would make [you]_p15699 even as [he]_p15701 is. No, [you]_p15702 must live! [You]_p15703 must struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. [You]_p15704 must fight Death himself, though [he]_p15705 come to [you]_p15706 in pain or in joy by the day, or the night in safety or in peril! On [your]_p15709 living soul [I]_p15710 charge [you]_p15707 that [you]_p15707 do not die, nay, nor think of death, till this great evil be past. "" The poor [dear]_n1835 grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as [I]_p15711 have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. [We]_p15712 were all silent [we]_p15713 could do nothing.",2,,41,
stoker_dracula," At length [she]_p15714 grew more calm and turning to [him]_p15716 said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as [she]_p15715 held out [her]_p15717 hand:, ""I promise you, [my]_p15720 [dear]_n1836 friend, that if God will let [me]_p15721 live, [I]_p15718 shall strive to do so till, if [it]_p15723 may be in [His]_p15724 good time, this horror may have passed away from me. "" [She]_p15725 was so good and brave that [we]_p15726 all felt that [our]_p15729 hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and [we]_p15727 began to discuss what [we]_p15727 were to do. [I]_p15730 told [her]_p15731 that [she]_p15732 was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs [we]_p15734 might hereafter use and was to keep the record as [she]_p15733 had done before. [She]_p15735 was pleased with the prospect of anything to do, if ""pleased"" could be used in connection with so grim an interest. As usual [Van Helsing]_n1837 had thought ahead of everyone else, and was prepared with an exact ordering of [our]_p15736 work. ""It is perhaps well,"" [he]_p15737 said, ""that at [our]_p15738 meeting after [our]_p15739 visit to Carfax [we]_p15740 decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay there. Had [we]_p15741 done so, the Count must have guessed [our]_p15742 purpose, and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others but now [he]_p15744 does not know [our]_p15743 intentions. [Nay]_n,1838 more, in all probability, [he]_p15745 does not know that such a power exists to [us]_p15747 as can sterilise [his]_p15748 lairs, so that [he]_p15746 cannot use [them]_p15749 as of old. [We]_p15750 are now so much further advanced in [our]_p15751 knowledge as to [their]_p15752 disposition that, when [we]_p15753 have examined the house in [Piccadilly]_n,1839 [we]_p15754 may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is [ours]_p15755  and in [it]_p15756 rests [our]_p15757 hope.",4,,42,
stoker_dracula," The sun that rose on [our]_p15758 sorrow this morning guards [us]_p15759 in [its]_p15760 course. Until [it]_p15761 sets [to-night]_n,1840 that monster must retain whatever form [he]_p15762 now has. [He]_p15763 is confined within the limitations of [his]_p15764 earthly envelope. [He]_p15765 cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies. If [he]_p15766 go through a doorway, [he]_p15767 must open the door like a mortal. And so [we]_p15768 have this day to hunt out all [his]_p15769 lairs and sterilise them. So [we]_p15770 shall, if [we]_p15771 have not yet catch [him]_p15772 and destroy him, drive [him]_p15773 to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure. "" Here [I]_p15775 started up for [I]_p15776 could not contain [myself]_p15777 at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us, since whilst [we]_p15778 talked action was impossible. But [Van Helsing]_n1841 held up [his]_p15779 hand warningly. ""Nay, friend Jonathan,"" [he]_p15780 said, ""in this, the quickest way home is the longest way, so [your]_p15781 proverb say.",2,,23,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p15782 shall all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in [Piccadilly]_n1842. The Count may have many houses which [he]_p15783 has bought. Of [them]_p15784 [he]_p15785 will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things. [He]_p15786 will have paper that [he]_p15787 write on [he]_p15788 will have [his]_p15789 book of cheques. There are many belongings that [he]_p15790 must have somewhere why not in this place so central, so quiet, where [he]_p15791 come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. [We]_p15792 shall go there and search that house and when [we]_p15793 learn what [it]_p15798 holds, then [we]_p15794 do what [our]_p15800 friend [Arthur]_n1843 call, in [his]_p15802 phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so [we]_p15794 run down [our]_p15801 old fox, so? is [it]_p15799 not?"" ""Then let [us]_p15803 come at once,"" [I]_p15804 cried, ""we are wasting the precious, precious time!"" The [Professor]_n1844 did not move, but simply said:, ""And how are [we]_p15795 to get into that house in [Piccadilly]_n?""1845 ""Any way!"" [I]_p15805 cried. ""We shall break in if need be. ""  ""And [your]_p15806 police where will [they]_p15807 be, and what will [they]_p15808 say?""  [I]_p15809 was staggered but [I]_p15810 knew that if [he]_p15811 wished to delay [he]_p15812 had a good reason for it. So [I]_p15813 said, as quietly as [I]_p15814 could:,   ""Don't wait more than need be [you]_p15817 know, [I]_p15814 am sure, what torture [I]_p15815 am in.",4,,35,
stoker_dracula," ""  ""Ah, [my]_p15818 child, that [I]_p15819 do and indeed there is no wish of [me]_p15820 to add to [your]_p15821 anguish. But just think, what can [we]_p15822 do, until all the world be at movement. Then will come [our]_p15823 time. [I]_p15824 have thought and thought, and [it]_p15825 seems to [me]_p15826 that the simplest way is the best of all. Now [we]_p15827 wish to get into the house, but [we]_p15828 have no key is [it]_p15829 not so?"" [I]_p15830 nodded. ""Now suppose that [you]_p15831 were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could not still get [it]_p15834 and think there was to [you]_p15832 no conscience of the housebreaker, what would [you]_p15832 do?""  ""I should get a respectable locksmith, and set [him]_p15835 to work to pick the lock for me. ""  ""And [your]_p15836 police, [they]_p15837 would interfere, would [they]_p15838 not?""  ""Oh, no! not if [they]_p15838 knew the man was properly employed.

[Your]_p15844 police must indeed be zealous men and clever, oh, so clever!, in reading the heart, that [they]_p15845 trouble [themselves]_p15846 in such matter. No, no, [my]_p15847 friend Jonathan, [you]_p15848 go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this [your]_p15850 London, or of any city in the world and if [you]_p15849 do [it]_p15851 as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere.",0,,34,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p15852 have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when [he]_p15853 went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up [his]_p15854 house, some burglar came and broke window at back and got in. Then [he]_p15855 went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then [he]_p15856 have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice  and when the day come [he]_p15857 sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then [he]_p15858 go to a builder, and [he]_p15859 sell [him]_p15861 that house, making an agreement that [he]_p15859 pull [it]_p15862 down and take all away within a certain time. And [your]_p15863 police and other authority help [him]_p15864 all [they]_p15865 can. And when that owner come back from [his]_p15866 holiday in Switzerland [he]_p15868 find only an empty hole where [his]_p15867 house had been. This was all done [en]_n1846 [r]_p15871 gle and in [our]_p15869 work [we]_p15870 shall be [en]_n1847 [r]_p15872 gle too. [We]_p15873 shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem [it]_p15874 strange but [we]_p15875 shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were [we]_p15876 indeed owners of the house. ""  [I]_p15877 could not but see how right [he]_p15878 was and the terrible despair of Mina's face became relaxed a thought there was hope in such good counsel. [Van Helsing]_n1848 went on:, ""When once within that house [we]_p15879 may find more clues at any rate some of [us]_p15880 can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earth-boxes, at Bermondsey and [Mile]_n1849 End.",4,,29,
stoker_dracula," "" [Lord Godalming]_n1850 stood up. ""I can be of some use here,"" [he]_p15881 said. ""I shall wire to [my]_p15882 people to have horses and carriages where [they]_p15883 will be most convenient. "" ""Look here, old fellow,"" said Morris, ""it is a capital idea to have all ready in case [we]_p15884 want to go horsebacking but don't [you]_p15888 think that one of [your]_p15889 snappy carriages with [its]_p15890 heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or [Mile]_n1851 End would attract too much attention for [our]_p15891 purposes? [It]_p15892 seems to [me]_p15893 that [we]_p15885 ought to take cabs when [we]_p15885 go south or east and even leave [them]_p15894 somewhere near the neighbourhood [we]_p15886 are going to. "" ""Friend [Quincey]_n1852 is right!"" said the [Professor]_n1853. ""His head is what [you]_p15895 call in plane with the horizon. [It]_p15896 is a difficult thing that [we]_p15897 go to do, and [we]_p15898 do not want no peoples to watch [us]_p15899 if so [it]_p15900 may. ""  Mina took a growing interest in everything and [I]_p15901 was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping [her]_p15902 to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night. [She]_p15903 was very, very pale, almost ghastly, and so thin that [her]_p15904 lips were drawn away, showing [her]_p15905 teeth in somewhat of prominence. [I]_p15906 did not mention this last, lest [it]_p15907 should give [her]_p15909 needless pain but [it]_p15908 made [my]_p15911 blood run cold in [my]_p15912 veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked [her]_p15910 blood.",4,,32,
stoker_dracula," As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear. When [we]_p15913 came to the discussion of the sequence of [our]_p15914 efforts and of the disposition of [our]_p15915 forces, there were new sources of doubt. [It]_p15916 was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly [we]_p15917 should destroy the Count's lair close at hand. In case [he]_p15918 should find [it]_p15919 out too soon, [we]_p15920 should thus be still ahead of [him]_p15921 in [our]_p15922 work of destruction and [his]_p15923 presence in [his]_p15924 purely material shape, and at [his]_p15924 weakest, might give [us]_p15926 some new clue. As to the disposal of forces, [it]_p15927 was suggested by the [Professor]_n1854 that, after [our]_p15928 visit to Carfax, [we]_p15929 should all enter the house in [Piccadilly]_n1855 that the two doctors and [I]_p15930 should remain there, whilst [Lord]_n1856 [Godalming]_n1857 and [Quincey]_n1858 found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them. [It]_p15931 was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so [we]_p15932 might be able to cope with [him]_p15933 then and there. At any rate, [we]_p15934 might be able to follow [him]_p15935 in force. To this plan [I]_p15936 strenuously objected, and so far as [my]_p15940 going was concerned, for [I]_p15937 said that [I]_p15937 intended to stay and protect Mina, [I]_p15938 thought that [my]_p15941 mind was made up on the subject but Mina would not listen to [my]_p15941 objection. [She]_p15943 said that there might be some law matter in which [I]_p15944 could be useful that amongst the Count's papers might be some clue which [I]_p15945 could understand out of [my]_p15946 experience in Transylvania  and that, as [it]_p15947 was, all the strength [we]_p15948 could muster was required to cope with the Count's extraordinary power. [I]_p15949 had to give in, for [Mina]_n's1859 resolution was fixed [she]_p15950 said that [it]_p15951 was the last hope for [her]_p15952 that [we]_p15953 should all work together.",6,,41,
stoker_dracula," ""As for me,"" [she]_p15954 said, ""I have no fear. Things have been as bad as [they]_p15955 can be and whatever may happen must have in [it]_p15956 some element of hope or comfort. Go, [my]_p15957 husband! God can, if [He]_p15958 wishes it, guard [me]_p15959 as well alone as with any one present. "" So [I]_p15960 started up crying out: ""Then in God's name let [us]_p15961 come at once, for [we]_p15962 are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than [we]_p15963 think. "" ""Not so!"" said [Van Helsing]_n,1860 holding up [his]_p15964 hand. ""But why?"" [I]_p15965 asked. ""Do [you]_p15966 forget,"" [he]_p15967 said, with actually a smile, ""that last night [he]_p15968 banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?""  Did [I]_p15969 forget! shall [I]_p15970 ever, can [I]_p15970 ever! Can any of [us]_p15972 ever forget that terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep [her]_p15973 brave countenance but the pain overmastered [her]_p15974 and [she]_p15977 put [her]_p15974 hands before [her]_p15975 face, and shuddered whilst [she]_p15978 moaned. [Van Helsing]_n1861 had not intended to recall [her]_p15979 frightful experience. [He]_p15980 had simply lost sight of [her]_p15981 and [her]_p15982 part in the affair in [his]_p15983 intellectual effort.",2,,30,
stoker_dracula," When [it]_p15984 struck [him]_p15985 what [he]_p15986 said, [he]_p15987 was horrified at [his]_p15988 thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. ""Oh, [Madam]_n1862 Mina,"" [he]_p15989 said, ""[dear]_n,1863 [[dear]_n1864 [Madam]_n1865 Mina]_n,1866 alas! that [I]_p15990 of all who so reverence [you]_p15991 should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so but [you]_p15992 will forget it, will [you]_p15993 not?"" [He]_p15999 bent low beside [her]_p16000 as [he]_p16002 spoke [she]_p16003 took [his]_p16004 hand, and looking at [him]_p16005 through [her]_p16001 tears, said hoarsely:,   ""No, [I]_p16006 shall not forget, for [it]_p15995 is well that [I]_p16007 remember and with [it]_p15996 [I]_p16007 have so much in memory of [you]_p15993 that is sweet, that [I]_p16008 take [it]_p15996 all together. Now, [you]_p16010 must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and [we]_p16011 must all eat that [we]_p16012 may be strong. ""  Breakfast was a strange meal to [us]_p16013 all. [We]_p16014 tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us. When [it]_p16015 was over, [Van Helsing]_n1867 stood up and said:, ""Now, [my]_p16016 [dear]_n1868 friends, [we]_p16017 go forth to [our]_p16018 terrible enterprise. Are [we]_p16019 all armed, as [we]_p16020 were on that night when first [we]_p16020 visited [our]_p16022 enemy's lair armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?"" [We]_p16023 all assured him. ""Then [it]_p16024 is well.",7,,40,
stoker_dracula," Now, [Madam]_n1869 Mina, [you]_p16025 are in any case quite safe here until the sunset and before then [we]_p16027 shall return, if, , [We]_p16029 shall return! But before [we]_p16028 go let [me]_p16030 see [you]_p16026 armed against personal attack. [I]_p16031 have myself, since [you]_p16032 came down, prepared [your]_p16033 chamber by the placing of things of which [we]_p16034 know, so that [He]_p16035 may not enter. Now let [me]_p16036 guard yourself. On [your]_p16037 forehead [I]_p16038 touch this piece of [Sacred Wafer]_n1870 in the name of the Father, the Son, and, , "" There was a fearful scream which almost froze [our]_p16039 hearts to hear. As [he]_p16040 had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, [it]_p16041 had seared it, had burned into the flesh as though [it]_p16042 had been a piece of white-hot metal. [My]_p16044 poor darling's brain had told [her]_p16045 the significance of the fact as quickly as [her]_p16046 nerves received the pain of [it]_p16049 and the two so overwhelmed [her]_p16046 that [her]_p16047 overwrought nature had [its]_p16050 voice in that dreadful scream. But the words to [her]_p16051 thought came quickly the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and [she]_p16053 sank on [her]_p16052 knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling [her]_p16054 beautiful hair over [her]_p16055 face, as the leper of old [his]_p16056 mantle, [she]_p16057 wailed out:, ""Unclean! Unclean! Even the [Almighty]_n1871 shuns [my]_p16058 polluted flesh! [I]_p16060 must bear this mark of shame upon [my]_p16059 forehead until the [Judgment Day]_n1872. "" [They]_p16061 all paused. [I]_p16062 had thrown [myself]_p16063 beside [her]_p16064 in an agony of helpless grief, and putting [my]_p16066 arms around held [her]_p16065 tight.",4,,41,
stoker_dracula," For a few minutes [our]_p16067 sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around [us]_p16068 turned away [their]_p16069 eyes that ran tears silently. Then [Van Helsing]_n1873 turned and said gravely so gravely that [I]_p16070 could not help feeling that [he]_p16071 was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:, ""It may be that [you]_p16074 may have to bear that mark till God [himself]_p16072 see fit, as [He]_p16075 most surely shall, on the [Judgment Day]_n,1874 to redress all wrongs of the earth and of [His]_p16077 children that [He]_p16076 has placed thereon. And oh, [Madam]_n1875 Mina, [my]_p16078 [dear]_n,1876 [my]_p16079 [dear]_n,1877 may [we]_p16080 who love [you]_p16082 be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave [your]_p16083 forehead as pure as the heart [we]_p16081 know. For so surely as [we]_p16084 live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us. Till then [we]_p16085 bear [our]_p16086 Cross, as [His]_p16087 Son did in obedience to [His]_p16088 Will. [It]_p16089 may be that [we]_p16090 are chosen instruments of [His]_p16092 good pleasure, and that [we]_p16091 ascend to [His]_p16093 bidding as that other through stripes and shame through tears and blood through doubts and fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man. ""  There was hope in [his]_p16094 words, and comfort and [they]_p16095 made for resignation. Mina and [I]_p16096 both felt so, and simultaneously [we]_p16097 each took one of the old man's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word [we]_p16098 all [knelt]_n1878 down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other. [We]_p16099 men pledged [ourselves]_p16100 to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of [her]_p16101 whom, each in [his]_p16102 own way, [we]_p16103 loved and [we]_p16104 prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.",6,,37,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p16105 was then time to start. So [I]_p16106 said farewell to Mina, a parting which neither of [us]_p16107 shall forget to [our]_p16108 dying day and [we]_p16109 set out. To one thing [I]_p16110 have made up [my]_p16111 mind: if [we]_p16112 find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then [she]_p16113 shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone. [I]_p16114 suppose [it]_p16115 is thus that in old times one vampire meant many just as [their]_p16116 hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for [their]_p16117 ghastly ranks. [We]_p16118 entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion. [It]_p16119 was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and [decay]_n1879 there was any ground for such fear as already [we]_p16120 knew. Had not [our]_p16121 minds been made up, and had there not been terrible memories to spur [us]_p16123 on, [we]_p16124 could hardly have proceeded with [our]_p16122 task. [We]_p16125 found no papers, or any sign of use in the house and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as [we]_p16126 had seen [them]_p16127 last. Dr [Van Helsing]_n1880 said to [us]_p16128 solemnly as [we]_p16129 stood before them:, ""And now, [my]_p16131 friends, [we]_p16130 have a duty here to do. [We]_p16132 must sterilise this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that [he]_p16133 has brought from a far distant land for such fell use.",2,,29,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p16134 has chosen this earth because [it]_p16135 has been holy. Thus [we]_p16136 defeat [him]_p16138 with [his]_p16139 own weapon, for [we]_p16137 make [it]_p16140 more holy still. [It]_p16141 was sanctified to such use of man, now [we]_p16142 sanctify [it]_p16143 to God. "" As [he]_p16144 spoke [he]_p16145 took from [his]_p16146 bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and close but [we]_p16147 did not somehow seem to mind, for [our]_p16148 attention was concentrated on the [Professor]_n1881. Taking from [his]_p16149 box a piece of the Sacred Wafer [he]_p16150 laid [it]_p16152 reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw [it]_p16153 home, [we]_p16154 aiding [him]_p16155 as [he]_p16151 worked. One by one [we]_p16156 treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left [them]_p16158 as [we]_p16157 had found [them]_p16159 to all appearance but in each was a portion of the Host. When [we]_p16160 closed the door behind us, the [Professor]_n1882 said solemnly:, ""So much is already done. If [it]_p16161 may be that with all the others [we]_p16162 can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on [Madam]_n1883 Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!"" As [we]_p16163 passed across the lawn on [our]_p16165 way to the station to catch [our]_p16166 train [we]_p16163 could see the front of the asylum. [I]_p16167 looked eagerly, and in the window of [my]_p16168 own room saw Mina.",3,,35,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p16169 waved [my]_p16170 hand to her, and nodded to tell that [our]_p16171 work there was successfully accomplished. [She]_p16172 nodded in reply to show that [she]_p16173 understood. The last [I]_p16174 saw, [she]_p16175 was waving [her]_p16176 hand in farewell. [It]_p16177 was with a heavy heart that [we]_p16178 sought the station and just caught the train, which was steaming in as [we]_p16179 reached the platform. [I]_p16180 have written this in the train. * * * * * [Piccadilly]_n,1884 12:30 o'clock. , Just before [we]_p16181 reached Fenchurch Street Lord [Godalming]_n1885 said to me:, ""Quincey and [I]_p16182 will find a locksmith. [You]_p16183 had better not come with [us]_p16184 in case there should be any difficulty for under the circumstances [it]_p16186 wouldn't seem so bad for [us]_p16185 to break into an empty house. But [you]_p16187 are a solicitor and the [Incorporated Law Society]_n1886 might tell [you]_p16188 that [you]_p16188 should have known better. "" [I]_p16190 demurred as to [my]_p16191 not sharing any danger even of odium, but [he]_p16192 went on: ""Besides, [it]_p16193 will attract less attention if there are not too many of us.",3,,25,
stoker_dracula," [My]_p16194 title will make [it]_p16195 all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. [You]_p16196 had better go with [Jack]_n1887 and the [Professor]_n1888 and stay in the [Green]_n1889 Park, somewhere in sight of the house and when [you]_p16197 see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do [you]_p16198 all come across. [We]_p16199 shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let [you]_p16200 in. "" ""The advice is good!"" said [Van Helsing]_n,1890 so [we]_p16202 said no more. [Godalming]_n1891 and Morris hurried off in a cab, [we]_p16203 following in another. At the corner of Arlington Street [our]_p16204 contingent got out and strolled into the [Green]_n1892 Park. [My]_p16205 heart beat as [I]_p16206 saw the house on which so much of [our]_p16207 hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in [its]_p16208 deserted condition amongst [its]_p16209 more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. [We]_p16210 sat down on a bench within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as [we]_p16211 waited for the coming of the others. At length [we]_p16212 saw a four-wheeler drive up.",6,,18,
stoker_dracula," Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got [Lord]_n1893 [Godalming]_n1894 and Morris and down from the box descended a thick-set working man with [his]_p16213 rush-woven basket of tools. [Morris]_n1895 paid the cabman, who touched [his]_p16214 hat and drove away. Together the two ascended the steps, and [Lord]_n1896 [Godalming]_n1897 pointed out what [he]_p16215 wanted done. The workman took off [his]_p16216 coat leisurely and hung [it]_p16217 on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed [his]_p16218 bag beside him. After searching through it, [he]_p16219 took out a selection of tools which [he]_p16220 produced to lay beside [him]_p16221 in orderly fashion. Then [he]_p16222 stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to [his]_p16223 employers, made some remark. [Lord Godalming]_n1898 smiled, and the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys selecting one of them, [he]_p16224 began to probe the lock, as if feeling [his]_p16225 way with it. After fumbling about for a bit [he]_p16226 tried a second, and then a third. All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and [he]_p16227 and the two others entered the hall.",6,,15,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p16228 sat still [my]_p16229 own cigar burnt furiously, but [Van Helsing]_n's1899 went cold altogether. [We]_p16230 waited patiently as [we]_p16231 saw the workman come out and bring in [his]_p16232 bag. Then [he]_p16233 held the door partly open, steadying [it]_p16235 with [his]_p16236 knees, whilst [he]_p16234 fitted a key to the lock. This [he]_p16237 finally handed to [Lord Godalming]_n,1900 who took out [his]_p16238 purse and gave [him]_p16239 something. The man touched [his]_p16240 hat, took [his]_p16241 bag, put on [his]_p16241 coat and departed not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction. When the man had fairly gone, [we]_p16243 three crossed the street and knocked at the door. [It]_p16244 was immediately opened by [Quincey]_n1901 Morris, beside whom stood [Lord]_n1902 [Godalming]_n1903 lighting a cigar. ""The place smells so vilely,"" said the latter as [we]_p16245 came in. [It]_p16246 did indeed smell vilely, like the old chapel at Carfax, and with [our]_p16247 previous experience [it]_p16248 was plain to [us]_p16249 that the Count had been using the place pretty freely. [We]_p16250 moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack for [we]_p16251 knew [we]_p16252 had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet [we]_p16252 did not know whether the Count might not be in the house.",5,,26,
stoker_dracula," In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, [we]_p16254 found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which [we]_p16255 sought! [Our]_p16257 work was not over, and would never be until [we]_p16256 should have found the missing box. First [we]_p16258 opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no windows in it, so [we]_p16259 were not afraid of being over-looked. [We]_p16260 did not lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which [we]_p16261 had brought with [us]_p16264 [we]_p16262 opened them, one by one, and treated [them]_p16265 as [we]_p16262 had treated those others in the old chapel. [It]_p16267 was evident to [us]_p16268 that the Count was not at present in the house, and [we]_p16269 proceeded to search for any of [his]_p16270 effects. After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, [we]_p16271 came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects which might belong to the Count and so [we]_p16272 proceeded to minutely examine them. [They]_p16273 lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room table. There were title deeds of the [Piccadilly]_n1904 house in a great bundle deeds of the purchase of the houses at [Mile]_n1905 End and Bermondsey note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink.",2,,19,
stoker_dracula," All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep [them]_p16274 from the dust. There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin, the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses. When [we]_p16275 had examined this last find, [Lord]_n1906 [Godalming]_n1907 and [Quincey]_n1908 Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the [East]_n1909 and the South, took with [them]_p16276 the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of [us]_p16277 are, with what patience [we]_p16278 can, waiting [their]_p16279 return, or the coming of the Count. CHAPTER XXIII [DR]_n1910. SEWARD'S [DIARY]_n1911 3 October. , The time seemed terrible long whilst [we]_p16280 were waiting for the coming of [Godalming]_n1912 and [Quincey Morris]_n1913. The [Professor]_n1914 tried to keep [our]_p16281 minds active by using [them]_p16282 all the time. [I]_p16283 could see [his]_p16284 beneficent purpose, by the side glances which [he]_p16285 threw from time to time at Harker.",9,,12,
stoker_dracula," The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see. Last night [he]_p16286 was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day [he]_p16287 is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of [his]_p16288 face. [His]_p16289 energy is still intact in fact, [he]_p16290 is like a living flame. This may yet be [his]_p16291 salvation, for, if all go well, [it]_p16292 will tide [him]_p16293 over the despairing period [he]_p16294 will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. [Poor]_n1915 fellow, [I]_p16295 thought [my]_p16296 own trouble was bad enough, but his, , ! The [Professor]_n1916 knows this well enough, and is doing [his]_p16297 best to keep [his]_p16298 mind active. What [he]_p16300 has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So well as [I]_p16301 can remember, here [it]_p16304 is:,   ""I have studied, over and over again since [they]_p16305 came into [my]_p16306 hands, all the papers relating to this monster and the more [I]_p16302 have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp [him]_p16307 out. All through there are signs of [his]_p16308 advance not only of [his]_p16309 power, but of [his]_p16309 knowledge of it. As [I]_p16311 learned from the researches of [my]_p16312 friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth, [he]_p16313 was in life a most wonderful man.",2,,26,
stoker_dracula," Soldier, statesman, and alchemist, which latter was the highest development of the science-knowledge of [his]_p16314 time. [He]_p16315 had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. [He]_p16316 dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of [his]_p16317 time that [he]_p16318 did not essay. Well, in [him]_p16319 the brain powers survived the physical death though [it]_p16320 would seem that memory was not all complete. In some faculties of mind [he]_p16321 has been, and is, only a child but [he]_p16322 is growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of man's stature. [He]_p16323 is experimenting, and doing [it]_p16324 well and if [it]_p16325 had not been that [we]_p16326 have crossed [his]_p16328 path [he]_p16329 would be yet, [he]_p16330 may be yet if [we]_p16327 fail, the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life. ""  Harker groaned and said, ""And this is all arrayed against [my]_p16331 darling! But how is [he]_p16332 experimenting? The knowledge may help [us]_p16333 to defeat him!""  ""He has all along, since [his]_p16334 coming, been trying [his]_p16335 power, slowly but surely that big child-brain of [his]_p16335 is working. Well for us, [it]_p16337 is, as yet, a child-brain for had [he]_p16338 dared, at the first, to attempt certain things [he]_p16339 would long ago have been beyond [our]_p16340 power. However, [he]_p16341 means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before [him]_p16342 can afford to wait and to go slow. Festina [lente]_n1917 may well be [his]_p16343 motto.",1,,30,
stoker_dracula," ""  ""I fail to understand,"" said Harker wearily. ""Oh, do be more plain to me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling [my]_p16344 brain. "" The [Professor]_n1918 laid [his]_p16345 hand tenderly on [his]_p16346 shoulder as [he]_p16347 spoke:, ""Ah, [my]_p16348 child, [I]_p16349 will be plain. Do [you]_p16350 not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How [he]_p16351 has been making use of the zo phagous patient to effect [his]_p16354 entry into friend John's home for [your]_p16355 Vampire, though in all afterwards [he]_p16352 can come when and how [he]_p16352 will, must at the first make entry only when asked [thereto]_p16356 by an inmate. But these are not [his]_p16357 most important experiments. Do [we]_p16358 not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. [He]_p16359 knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great child-brain of [his]_p16360 was growing, and [he]_p16361 began to consider whether [he]_p16362 might not [himself]_p16363 move the box. So [he]_p16364 began to help and then, when [he]_p16365 found that this be all-right, [he]_p16365 try to move [them]_p16367 all alone.",1,,24,
stoker_dracula," And so [he]_p16368 progress, and [he]_p16369 scatter these graves of [him]_p16371 and none but [he]_p16369 know where [they]_p16372 are hidden. [He]_p16373 may have intend to bury [them]_p16374 deep in the ground. So that [he]_p16375 only use [them]_p16377 in the night, or at such time as [he]_p16376 can change [his]_p16378 form, [they]_p16381 do [him]_p16382 equal well and none may know these are [his]_p16379 hiding-place! But, [my]_p16385 child, do not despair this knowledge come to [him]_p16383 just too late! Already all of [his]_p16379 lairs but [one]_p16386 be sterilise as for [him]_p16383  and before the sunset this shall be so. Then [he]_p16387 have no place where [he]_p16388 can move and hide. [I]_p16389 delayed this morning that so [we]_p16390 might be sure. Is there not more at stake for [us]_p16391 than for him? Then why [we]_p16393 not be even more careful than him? By [my]_p16394 clock [it]_p16395 is one hour and already, if all be well, friend [Arthur]_n1919 and [Quincey]_n1920 are on [their]_p16396 way to us. [To-day]_n1921 is [our]_p16397 day, and [we]_p16398 must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are five of [us]_p16399 when those absent ones return. ""  Whilst [he]_p16400 was speaking [we]_p16401 were startled by a knock at the hall door, the double postman's knock of the telegraph boy. [We]_p16402 all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and [Van Helsing]_n,1922 holding up [his]_p16403 hand to [us]_p16404 to keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it.",4,,36,
stoker_dracula," The boy handed in a despatch. The [Professor]_n1923 closed the door again, and, after looking at the direction, opened [it]_p16405 and read aloud. ""Look out for D. [He]_p16406 has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South. [He]_p16407 seems to be going the round and may want to see you: [Mina]_n1924. "" There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:, ""Now, God be thanked, [we]_p16408 shall soon meet!"" [Van Helsing]_n1925 turned to [him]_p16409 quickly and said:, ""God will act in [His]_p16410 own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet for what [we]_p16411 wish for at the moment may be [our]_p16412 undoings. ""  ""I care for nothing now,"" [he]_p16413 answered hotly, ""except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation. [I]_p16414 would sell [my]_p16415 soul to do it!"" ""Oh, hush, hush, [my]_p16416 child!"" said [Van Helsing]_n1926. ""God does not purchase souls in this wise and the Devil, though [he]_p16417 may purchase, does not keep faith.",4,,13,
stoker_dracula," But God is merciful and just, and knows [your]_p16418 pain and [your]_p16419 devotion to that [dear Madam Mina]_n1927. Think you, how [her]_p16420 pain would be doubled, did [she]_p16421 but hear [your]_p16422 wild words. Do not fear any of us, [we]_p16423 are all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is coming for action [to-day]_n1928 this [Vampire]_n1929 is limit to the powers of man, and till sunset [he]_p16424 may not change. [It]_p16425 will take [him]_p16426 time to arrive here, see, [it]_p16427 is twenty minutes past one, and there are yet some times before [he]_p16428 can hither come, be [he]_p16429 never so quick. What [we]_p16430 must hope for is that [my]_p16431 [Lord]_n1930 [Arthur]_n1931 and [Quincey]_n1932 arrive first. "" About half an hour after [we]_p16432 had received [Mrs Harker]_n's1933 telegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. [It]_p16433 was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but [it]_p16434 made the [Professor]_n's1934 heart and [mine]_p16435 beat loudly. [We]_p16436 looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall [we]_p16437 each held ready to use [our]_p16438 various armaments, the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. [Van Helsing]_n1935 pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action.",9,,21,
stoker_dracula," The gladness of [our]_p16439 hearts must have shown upon [our]_p16440 faces when on the step, close to the door, [we]_p16441 saw [Lord]_n1936 [Godalming]_n1937 and [Quincey]_n1938 Morris. [They]_p16442 came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former saying, as [they]_p16443 moved along the hall:,   ""It is all right. [We]_p16444 found both places six boxes in each and [we]_p16445 destroyed [them]_p16446 all!"" ""Destroyed?"" asked the [Professor]_n1939. ""For him!"" [We]_p16447 were silent for a minute, and then [Quincey]_n1940 said:, ""There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, [he]_p16448 doesn't turn up by five o'clock, [we]_p16449 must start off for [it]_p16450 won't do to leave [Mrs Harker]_n1941 alone after sunset. "" ""He will be here before long now,"" said [Van Helsing]_n,1942 who had been consulting [his]_p16451 pocket-book. ""Nota bene, in [Madam]_n's1943 telegram [he]_p16452 went south from Carfax, that means [he]_p16453 went to cross the river, and [he]_p16453 could only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one o'clock. That [he]_p16455 went south has a meaning for us. [He]_p16456 is as yet only suspicious and [he]_p16457 went from Carfax first to the place where [he]_p16458 would suspect interference least. [You]_p16459 must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him.",8,,21,
stoker_dracula," That [he]_p16460 is not here already shows that [he]_p16461 went to [Mile]_n1944 End next. This took [him]_p16462 some time for [he]_p16463 would then have to be carried over the river in some way. Believe me, [my]_p16464 friends, [we]_p16465 shall not have long to wait now. [We]_p16466 should have ready some plan of attack, so that [we]_p16467 may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all [your]_p16468 arms! Be ready!"" [He]_p16469 held up a warning hand as [he]_p16470 spoke, for [we]_p16471 all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door. [I]_p16472 could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself. In all [our]_p16473 hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, [Quincey]_n1945 Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and [Arthur]_n1946 and [I]_p16474 had been accustomed to obey [him]_p16475 implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, [he]_p16476 at once laid out [our]_p16477 plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed [us]_p16478 each in position.",3,,19,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n,1947 Harker, and [I]_p16479 were just behind the door, so that when [it]_p16480 was opened the [Professor]_n1948 could guard [it]_p16481 whilst [we]_p16482 two stepped between the incomer and the door. [Godalming]_n1949 behind and [Quincey]_n1950 in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window. [We]_p16483 waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise, at least [he]_p16484 feared it. Suddenly with a single bound [he]_p16485 leaped into the room, winning a way past [us]_p16486 before any of [us]_p16487 could raise a hand to stay him. There was something so panther-like in the movement, something so unhuman, that [it]_p16488 seemed to sober [us]_p16489 all from the shock of [his]_p16490 coming. The first to act was Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw [himself]_p16491 before the door leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over [his]_p16492 face, showing the eye-teeth long and pointed but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain. [His]_p16493 expression again changed as, with a single impulse, [we]_p16494 all advanced upon him. [It]_p16495 was a pity that [we]_p16496 had not some better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment [I]_p16498 wondered what [we]_p16497 were to do.",4,,20,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p16499 did not [myself]_p16500 know whether [our]_p16501 lethal weapons would avail [us]_p16502 anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for [he]_p16503 had ready [his]_p16504 great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The blow was a powerful one only the diabolical quickness of the Count's leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through [his]_p16505 heart. As [it]_p16506 was, the point just cut the cloth of [his]_p16507 coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out. The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a moment [I]_p16508 feared for Harker, though [I]_p16509 saw [him]_p16510 throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively [I]_p16511 moved forward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in [my]_p16512 left hand. [I]_p16513 felt a mighty power fly along [my]_p16515 arm and [it]_p16516 was without surprise that [I]_p16514 saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us. [It]_p16517 would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity, of anger and hellish rage, which came over the Count's face. [His]_p16518 waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of [his]_p16519 burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound.",0,,21,
stoker_dracula," The next instant, with a sinuous dive [he]_p16520 swept under Harker's arm, ere [his]_p16521 blow could fall, and, grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw [himself]_p16522 at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, [he]_p16523 tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the shivering glass [I]_p16524 could hear the ""ting"" of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging. [We]_p16525 ran over and saw [him]_p16526 spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door. There [he]_p16527 turned and spoke to us:,   ""You think to baffle me, you, with [your]_p16528 pale faces all in a row, like sheep in a butcher's. [You]_p16529 shall be sorry yet, each one of you! [You]_p16530 think [you]_p16531 have left [me]_p16533 without a place to rest but [I]_p16534 have more. [My]_p16535 revenge is just begun! [I]_p16536 spread [it]_p16537 over centuries, and time is on [my]_p16538 side. [Your]_p16539 girls that [you]_p16540 all love are [mine]_p16542 already and through [them]_p16544 [you]_p16541 and others shall yet be mine, [my]_p16545 creatures, to do [my]_p16546 bidding and to be [my]_p16546 jackals when [I]_p16548 want to feed. Bah!"" With a contemptuous sneer, [he]_p16549 passed quickly through the door, and [we]_p16551 heard the rusty bolt creak as [he]_p16550 fastened [it]_p16552 behind him.",0,,31,
stoker_dracula," A door beyond opened and shut. The first of [us]_p16553 to speak was the [Professor]_n,1951 as, realising the difficulty of following [him]_p16554 through the stable, [we]_p16555 moved toward the hall. ""We have learnt something, much! Notwithstanding [his]_p16556 brave words, [he]_p16557 fears [us]_p16561 [he]_p16558 fear time, [he]_p16558 fear want! For if not, why [he]_p16559 hurry so? [His]_p16562 very tone betray him, or [my]_p16563 ears deceive. Why take that money? [You]_p16564 follow quick. [You]_p16565 are hunters of wild beast, and understand [it]_p16566 so. For me, [I]_p16567 make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that [he]_p16568 return. "" As [he]_p16569 spoke [he]_p16570 put the money remaining into [his]_p16572 pocket took the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace, where [he]_p16570 set fire to [them]_p16573 with a match. Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had lowered [himself]_p16575 from the window to follow the Count. [He]_p16576 had, however, bolted the stable door and by the time [they]_p16577 had forced [it]_p16578 open there was no sign of him. [Van Helsing]_n1952 and [I]_p16579 tried to make inquiry at the back of the house but the mews was deserted and no one had seen [him]_p16580 depart.",2,,27,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p16581 was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. [We]_p16582 had to recognise that [our]_p16583 game was up with heavy hearts [we]_p16584 agreed with the [Professor]_n1953 when [he]_p16585 said:, ""Let [us]_p16586 go back to [Madam]_n1954 Mina, poor, poor [dear [Madam]_n1955 Mina]_n1956. All [we]_p16587 can do just now is done and [we]_p16588 can there, at least, protect her. But [we]_p16589 need not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and [we]_p16590 must try to find [it]_p16591 when that is done all may yet be well. "" [I]_p16592 could see that [he]_p16593 spoke as bravely as [he]_p16594 could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken down now and again [he]_p16595 gave a low groan which [he]_p16596 could not suppress, [he]_p16596 was thinking of [his]_p16598 wife. With sad hearts [we]_p16599 came back to [my]_p16601 house, where [we]_p16600 found [Mrs Harker]_n1957 waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to [her]_p16602 bravery and unselfishness. When [she]_p16603 saw [our]_p16606 faces, [her]_p16607 own became as pale as death: for a second or two [her]_p16608 eyes were closed as if [she]_p16604 were in secret prayer and then [she]_p16604 said cheerfully:,   ""I can never thank [you]_p16609 all enough. Oh, [my]_p16610 [poor]_n1958 darling!"" As [she]_p16611 spoke, [she]_p16612 took [her]_p16613 husband's grey head in [her]_p16614 hands and kissed it, ""Lay [your]_p16615 [poor]_n1959 head here and [[rest]_n]_n1960 it.",9,,35,
stoker_dracula," All will yet be well, [dear]_n!1961 God will protect [us]_p16616 if [He]_p16617 so will [it]_p16618 in [His]_p16619 good intent. "" The [poor]_n1962 fellow groaned. There was no place for words in [his]_p16620 sublime misery. [We]_p16621 had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and [I]_p16622 think [it]_p16623 cheered [us]_p16624 all up somewhat. [It]_p16625 was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people, for none of [us]_p16626 had eaten anything since breakfast, or the sense of companionship may have helped [us]_p16627 but anyhow [we]_p16628 were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to [our]_p16629 promise, [we]_p16630 told Mrs Harker everything which had passed and although [she]_p16631 grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten [her]_p16633 husband, and red at others when [his]_p16635 devotion to [her]_p16634 was manifested, [she]_p16632 listened bravely and with calmness. When [we]_p16636 came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, [she]_p16637 clung to [her]_p16638 husband's arm, and held [it]_p16640 tight as though [her]_p16639 clinging could protect [him]_p16641 from any harm that might come. [She]_p16642 said nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up to the present time. Then without letting go [her]_p16643 husband's hand [she]_p16644 stood up amongst [us]_p16645 and spoke. Oh, that [I]_p16646 could give any idea of the scene of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of [her]_p16647 youth and animation, with the red scar on [her]_p16648 forehead, of which [she]_p16652 was conscious, and which [we]_p16654 saw with grinding of [our]_p16656 teeth, remembering whence and how [it]_p16659 came [her]_p16648 loving kindness against [our]_p16657 grim hate [her]_p16649 tender faith against all [our]_p16657 fears and doubting and we, knowing that so far as symbols went, [she]_p16653 with all [her]_p16649 goodness and purity and faith, was outcast from God.",2,,43,
stoker_dracula," ""Jonathan,"" [she]_p16660 said, and the word sounded like music on [her]_p16661 lips [it]_p16662 was so full of love and tenderness, ""Jonathan [dear]_n,1963 and [you]_p16663 all [my]_p16665 true, true friends, [I]_p16666 want [you]_p16664 to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time. [I]_p16667 know that [you]_p16668 must fight, that [you]_p16669 must destroy even as [you]_p16669 destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter  but [it]_p16671 is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be [his]_p16672 joy when he, too, is destroyed in [his]_p16673 worser part that [his]_p16673 better part may have spiritual immortality. [You]_p16675 must be pitiful to him, too, though [it]_p16676 may not hold [your]_p16677 hands from [his]_p16678 destruction. ""  As [she]_p16679 spoke [I]_p16680 could see [her]_p16681 husband's face darken and draw together, as though the passion in [him]_p16682 were shrivelling [his]_p16683 being to [its]_p16684 core. Instinctively the clasp on [his]_p16685 wife's hand grew closer, till [his]_p16686 knuckles looked white. [She]_p16687 did not flinch from the pain which [I]_p16688 knew [she]_p16689 must have suffered, but looked at [him]_p16690 with eyes that were more appealing than ever. As [she]_p16691 stopped speaking [he]_p16692 leaped to [his]_p16694 feet, almost tearing [his]_p16695 hand from [hers]_p16696 as [he]_p16693 spoke:,   ""May God give [him]_p16697 into [my]_p16699 hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of [him]_p16698 which [we]_p16700 are aiming at. If beyond [it]_p16701 [I]_p16703 could send [his]_p16705 soul for ever and ever to burning hell [I]_p16704 would do it!""  ""Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God.",1,,45,
stoker_dracula," Don't say such things, Jonathan, [my]_p16706 husband or [you]_p16707 will crush [me]_p16708 with fear and horror. Just think, [my]_p16709 [dear]_n,1964 [I]_p16710 have been thinking all this long, long day of it, that. perhaps. some day. I, too, may need such pity and that some other like you, and with equal cause for anger, may deny [it]_p16716 to me! Oh, [my]_p16717 husband! [my]_p16718 husband, indeed [I]_p16711 would have spared [you]_p16714 such a thought had there been another way but [I]_p16712 pray that God may not have treasured [your]_p16719 wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what [he]_p16720 has suffered, who all [his]_p16721 life has done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come. ""  [We]_p16722 men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and [we]_p16723 wept openly. [She]_p16724 wept, too, to see that [her]_p16725 sweeter counsels had prevailed. [Her]_p16726 husband flung [himself]_p16727 on [his]_p16728 knees beside her, and putting [his]_p16729 arms round her, hid [his]_p16729 face in the folds of [her]_p16731 dress.",1,,24,
stoker_dracula," [Van Helsing]_n1965 beckoned to [us]_p16734 and [we]_p16735 stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone with [their]_p16736 God. Before [they]_p16737 retired the [Professor]_n1966 fixed up the room against any coming of the Vampire, and assured Mrs Harker that [she]_p16738 might rest in peace. [She]_p16739 tried to school [herself]_p16740 to the belief, and, manifestly for [her]_p16741 husband's sake, tried to seem content. [It]_p16742 was a brave struggle and was, [I]_p16743 think and believe, not without [its]_p16744 reward. [Van Helsing]_n1967 had placed at hand a bell which either of [them]_p16745 was to sound in case of any emergency. When [they]_p16746 had retired, [Quincey]_n,1968 [Godalming]_n,1969 and [I]_p16747 arranged that [we]_p16748 should sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to [Quincey]_n,1970 so the [rest]_n1971 of [us]_p16749 shall be off to bed as soon as [we]_p16750 can. [Godalming]_n1972 has already turned in, for [his]_p16751 is the second watch. Now that [my]_p16752 work is done I, too, shall go to bed. Jonathan Harker's [Journal]_n1973.",9,,19,
stoker_dracula," 3-4 October, close to midnight. , [I]_p16753 thought yesterday would never end. There was over [me]_p16754 a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the better. Before [we]_p16755 parted, [we]_p16756 discussed what [our]_p16758 next step was to be, but [we]_p16756 could arrive at no result. All [we]_p16759 knew was that one earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where [it]_p16760 was. If [he]_p16761 chooses to lie hidden, [he]_p16762 may baffle [us]_p16763 for years and in the meantime!, the thought is too horrible, [I]_p16764 dare not think of [it]_p16765 even now. This [I]_p16766 know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that one is [my]_p16767 poor wronged darling. [I]_p16768 love [her]_p16769 a thousand times more for [her]_p16770 sweet pity of last night, a pity that made [my]_p16771 own hate of the monster seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me.",0,,19,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p16772 are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is [our]_p16773 only anchor. Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. [I]_p16774 fear what [her]_p16775 dreams might be like, with such terrible memories to ground [them]_p16776 in. [She]_p16777 has not been so calm, within [my]_p16778 seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came over [her]_p16779 face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March. [I]_p16780 thought at the time that [it]_p16782 was the softness of the red sunset on [her]_p16784 face, but somehow now [I]_p16781 think [it]_p16783 has a deeper meaning. [I]_p16785 am not sleepy myself, though [I]_p16786 am weary, weary to death. However, [I]_p16787 must try to sleep for there is [to-morrow]_n1974 to think of, and there is no [rest]_n1975 for [me]_p16788 until. * * * * *  Later. , [I]_p16789 must have fallen asleep, for [I]_p16790 was awaked by Mina, who was sitting up in bed, with a startled look on [her]_p16791 face.",2,,20,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p16792 could see easily, for [we]_p16794 did not leave the room in darkness [she]_p16795 had placed a warning hand over [my]_p16797 mouth, and now [she]_p16796 whispered in [my]_p16798 ear:,   ""Hush! there is someone in the corridor!"" [I]_p16793 got up softly, and crossing the room, gently opened the door. Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay [Mr Morris]_n,1976 wide awake. [He]_p16799 raised a warning hand for silence as [he]_p16800 whispered to me:,   ""Hush! go back to bed [it]_p16801 is all right. One of [us]_p16802 will be here all night. [We]_p16803 don't mean to take any chances!""  [His]_p16804 look and gesture forbade discussion, so [I]_p16805 came back and told Mina. [She]_p16806 sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over [her]_p16807 poor, pale face as [she]_p16809 put [her]_p16808 arms round [me]_p16811 and said softly:,   ""Oh, thank God for good brave men!"" With a sigh [she]_p16810 sank back again to sleep. [I]_p16812 write this now as [I]_p16813 am not sleepy, though [I]_p16813 must try again. * * * * *  4 October, morning. , Once again during the night [I]_p16815 was wakened by Mina. This time [we]_p16816 had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light.",1,,25,
stoker_dracula," [She]_p16817 said to [me]_p16818 hurriedly:, ""Go, call the [Professor]_n1977. [I]_p16819 want to see [him]_p16820 at once. ""  ""Why?"" [I]_p16821 asked. ""I have an idea. [I]_p16822 suppose [it]_p16823 must have come in the night, and matured without [my]_p16825 knowing it. [He]_p16826 must hypnotise [me]_p16827 before the dawn, and then [I]_p16828 shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest the time is getting close. "" [I]_p16829 went to the door. [Dr Seward]_n1978 was resting on the mattress, and, seeing me, [he]_p16830 sprang to [his]_p16831 feet. ""Is anything wrong?"" [he]_p16832 asked, in alarm.",2,,15,
stoker_dracula," ""No,"" [I]_p16833 replied ""but [Mina]_n1979 wants to see [Dr Van Helsing]_n1980 at once. "" ""I will go,"" [he]_p16834 said, and hurried into the [Professor]_n's1981 room. In two or three minutes later [Van Helsing]_n1982 was in the room in [his]_p16835 dressing-gown, and [Mr Morris]_n1983 and [Lord Godalming]_n1984 were with [Dr Seward]_n1985 at the door asking questions. When the [Professor]_n1986 saw Mina a smile, a positive smile ousted the anxiety of [his]_p16836 face [he]_p16838 rubbed [his]_p16837 hands as [he]_p16839 said:, ""Oh, [my]_p16840 [dear Madam Mina]_n,1987 this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan, [we]_p16841 have got [our]_p16842 [dear Madam Mina]_n,1988 as of old, back to [us]_p16843 to-day!"" Then turning to her, [he]_p16844 said, cheerfully: ""And what am [I]_p16845 do for you? For at this hour [you]_p16846 do not want [me]_p16848 for nothings. ""  ""I want [you]_p16849 to hypnotise me!"" [she]_p16850 said. ""Do [it]_p16851 before the dawn, for [I]_p16852 feel that then [I]_p16853 can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is short!"" Without a word [he]_p16854 motioned [her]_p16855 to sit up in bed. Looking fixedly at her, [he]_p16859 commenced to make passes in front of her, from over the top of [her]_p16856 head downward, with each hand in turn. [Mina]_n1989 gazed at [him]_p16860 fixedly for a few minutes, during which [my]_p16861 own heart beat like a trip hammer, for [I]_p16862 felt that some crisis was at hand.",11,,27,
stoker_dracula," Gradually [her]_p16863 eyes closed, and [she]_p16865 sat, stock still only by the gentle heaving of [her]_p16864 bosom could [one]_p16867 know that [she]_p16866 was alive. The [Professor]_n1990 made a few more passes and then stopped, and [I]_p16868 could see that [his]_p16869 forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened [her]_p16870 eyes but [she]_p16871 did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in [her]_p16872 eyes, and [her]_p16873 voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising [his]_p16874 hand to impose silence, the [Professor]_n1991 motioned to [me]_p16875 to bring the others in. [They]_p16876 came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on. [Mina]_n1992 appeared not to see them. The stillness was broken by [Van Helsing]_n's1993 voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of [her]_p16877 thoughts:, ""Where are you?"" The answer came in a neutral way:, ""I do not know. Sleep has no place [it]_p16878 can call [its]_p16879 own. "" For several minutes there was silence.",4,,17,
stoker_dracula," Mina sat rigid, and the [Professor]_n1994 stood staring at [her]_p16880 fixedly the rest of [us]_p16881 hardly dared to breathe. The room was growing lighter without taking [his]_p16882 eyes from Mina's face, Dr [Van Helsing]_n1995 motioned [me]_p16883 to pull up the blind. [I]_p16884 did so, and the day seemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse [itself]_p16885 through the room. On the instant the [Professor]_n1996 spoke again:, ""Where are [you]_p16886 now?"" The answer came dreamily, but with intention [it]_p16887 were as though [she]_p16888 were interpreting something. [I]_p16889 have heard [her]_p16890 use the same tone when reading [her]_p16891 shorthand notes. ""I do not know. [It]_p16892 is all strange to me!""  ""What do [you]_p16893 see?""  ""I can see nothing [it]_p16894 is all dark. "" ""What do [you]_p16895 hear?"" [I]_p16896 could detect the strain in the [Professor]_n's1997 patient voice. ""The lapping of water.",4,,17,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p16897 is gurgling by, and little waves leap. [I]_p16898 can hear [them]_p16899 on the outside. ""  ""Then [you]_p16900 are on a ship?"" [We]_p16901 all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the other. [We]_p16902 were afraid to think. The answer came quick:,   ""Oh, yes!""  ""What else do [you]_p16903 hear?""  ""The sound of men stamping overhead as [they]_p16904 run about. There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the rachet. ""  ""What are [you]_p16905 doing?""  ""I am still, oh, so still. [It]_p16906 is like death!"" The voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again. By this time the sun had risen, and [we]_p16907 were all in the full light of day. Dr [Van Helsing]_n1998 placed [his]_p16908 hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid [her]_p16909 head down softly on [her]_p16910 pillow.",1,,14,
stoker_dracula," [She]_p16911 lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see [us]_p16912 all around her. ""Have [I]_p16913 been talking in [my]_p16914 sleep?"" was all [she]_p16915 said. [She]_p16916 seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though [she]_p16917 was eager to know what [she]_p16918 had told. The [Professor]_n1999 repeated the conversation, and [she]_p16919 said:, ""Then there is not a moment to lose: [it]_p16920 may not be yet too late!"" Mr Morris and Lord [Godalming]_n2000 started for the door but the [Professor]_n's2001 calm voice called [them]_p16921 back:, ""Stay, [my]_p16922 friends. That ship, wherever [it]_p16923 was, was weighing anchor whilst [she]_p16924 spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in [your]_p16925 so great Port of London. Which of [them]_p16926 is [it]_p16927 that [you]_p16929 seek? God be thanked that [we]_p16930 have once again a clue, though whither [it]_p16928 may lead [us]_p16932 [we]_p16931 know not. [We]_p16933 have been blind somewhat blind after the manner of men, since when [we]_p16935 can look back [we]_p16936 see what [we]_p16936 might have seen looking forward if [we]_p16937 had been able to see what [we]_p16937 might have seen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle is [it]_p16940 not? [We]_p16934 can know now what was in the Count's mind, when [he]_p16941 seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce knife put [him]_p16943 in the danger that even [he]_p16942 dread. [He]_p16944 meant escape. Hear me, ESCAPE! [He]_p16945 saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him.",3,,35,

Tally Ho! as friend [Arthur]_n2002 would say when [he]_p16951 put on [his]_p16952 red frock! [Our]_p16953 old fox is wily oh! so wily, and [we]_p16954 must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and [I]_p16955 think [his]_p16957 mind in a little while. In meantime [we]_p16958 may rest and in peace, for there are waters between [us]_p16959 which [he]_p16960 do not want to pass, and which [he]_p16961 could not if [he]_p16961 would, unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to us. Let [us]_p16963 take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which [we]_p16965 all need, and which [we]_p16966 can eat comfortably since [he]_p16967 be not in the same land with us. "" Mina looked at [him]_p16968 appealingly as [she]_p16970 asked:,   ""But why need [we]_p16971 seek [him]_p16969 further, when [he]_p16972 is gone away from us?"" [He]_p16974 took [her]_p16975 hand and patted [it]_p16976 as [he]_p16973 replied:,   ""Ask [me]_p16977 nothings as yet. When [we]_p16978 have breakfast, then [I]_p16979 answer all questions. "" [He]_p16980 would say no more, and [we]_p16981 separated to dress.",1,,34,
stoker_dracula," After breakfast [Mina]_n2003 repeated [her]_p16982 question.

[She]_p16990 grew paler as [she]_p16991 asked faintly:, ""Why?"" ""Because,"" [he]_p16992 answered solemnly, ""he can live for centuries, and [you]_p16994 are but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded, since once [he]_p16995 put that mark upon [your]_p16996 throat. ""  [I]_p16997 was just in time to catch [her]_p16998 as [she]_p16999 fell forward in a faint.

He, [our]_p17017 enemy, have gone away [he]_p17018 have gone back to [his]_p17019 Castle in [Transylvania]_n2012. [I]_p17020 know [it]_p17021 so well, as if a great hand of fire wrote [it]_p17022 on the wall. [He]_p17023 have prepare for this in some way, and that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this [he]_p17024 took the money for this [he]_p17025 hurry at the last, lest [we]_p17026 catch [him]_p17027 before the sun go down. [It]_p17028 was [his]_p17029 last hope, save that [he]_p17030 might hide in the tomb that [he]_p17031 think poor Miss Lucy, being as [he]_p17031 thought like him, keep open to him. But there was not of time. When that fail [he]_p17033 make straight for [his]_p17034 last resource, [his]_p17035 last earth-work [I]_p17036 might say did [I]_p17037 wish double entente. [He]_p17038 is clever, oh, so clever! [he]_p17039 know that [his]_p17042 game here was finish and so [he]_p17040 decide [he]_p17040 go back home.",1,,32,

Jonathan Harker's [Journal]_n2017. 4 October. , When [I]_p17070 read to Mina, [Van Helsing]_n's2018 message in the phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country has given [her]_p17071 comfort  and comfort is strength to her. For [my]_p17073 own part, now that [his]_p17074 horrible danger is not face to face with us, [it]_p17075 seems almost impossible to believe in it. Even [my]_p17077 own terrible experiences in [Castle Dracula]_n2019 seem like a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight, , Alas! how can [I]_p17078 disbelieve! In the midst of [my]_p17079 thought [my]_p17080 eye fell on the red scar on [my]_p17080 [poor]_n2020 darling's white forehead. Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of [it]_p17082 will keep faith crystal clear.",5,,11,
stoker_dracula," Mina and [I]_p17083 fear to be idle, so [we]_p17084 have been over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting. Mina says that perhaps [we]_p17085 are the instruments of ultimate good. [It]_p17086 may be! [I]_p17087 shall try to think as [she]_p17088 does. [We]_p17089 have never spoken to each other yet of the future. [It]_p17090 is better to wait till [we]_p17091 see the [Professor]_n2021 and the others after [their]_p17092 investigations.

stoker_dracula," 5 October, 5 p. m. , [Our]_p17096 meeting for report. [Present]_n:2023 [Professor]_n2024 [Van Helsing]_n,2025 [Lord]_n2026 [Godalming]_n,2027 Dr [Seward]_n,2028 [Mr Quincey Morris]_n,2029 Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker. Dr [Van Helsing]_n2030 described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound [Count Dracula]_n2031 made [his]_p17097 escape:, ""As [I]_p17098 knew that [he]_p17100 wanted to get back to Transylvania, [I]_p17099 felt sure that [he]_p17101 must go by the Danube mouth or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way [he]_p17101 come. [It]_p17103 was a dreary blank that was before us. Omne ignotum pro magnifico and so with heavy hearts [we]_p17104 start to find what ships leave for the [Black Sea]_n2032 last night. [He]_p17105 was in sailing ship, since [Madam]_n2033 Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in [your]_p17106 list of the shipping in the Times, and so [we]_p17108 go, by suggestion of [Lord Godalming]_n,2034 to [your]_p17107 Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small. There [we]_p17109 find that only one [Black-Sea-bound]_n2035 ship go out with the tide.",13,,14,
stoker_dracula," [She]_p17110 is the [Czarina Catherine]_n,2036 and [she]_p17111 sail from Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the Danube. 'Soh!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count. ' So off [we]_p17112 go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there [we]_p17113 find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office. From [him]_p17114 [we]_p17115 inquire of the goings of the [Czarina Catherine]_n2037. [He]_p17116 swear much, and [he]_p17117 red face and loud of voice, but [he]_p17118 good fellow all the same and when [Quincey]_n2038 give [him]_p17122 something from [his]_p17123 pocket which crackle as [he]_p17118 roll [it]_p17125 up, and put [it]_p17126 in a so small bag which [he]_p17119 have hid deep in [his]_p17124 clothing, [he]_p17119 still better fellow and humble servant to us. [He]_p17127 come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot these be better fellows too when [they]_p17128 have been no more thirsty. [They]_p17129 say much of blood and bloom, and of others which [I]_p17130 comprehend not, though [I]_p17131 guess what [they]_p17132 mean but nevertheless [they]_p17133 tell [us]_p17134 all things which [we]_p17135 want to know. ""They make known to [us]_p17136 among them, how last afternoon at about five o'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That [he]_p17137 be all in black, except that [he]_p17138 have a hat of straw which suit not [him]_p17139 or the time.",3,,30,
stoker_dracula," That [he]_p17140 scatter [his]_p17141 money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the [Black Sea]_n2039 and for where. Some took [him]_p17142 to the office and then to the ship, where [he]_p17144 will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when told that [he]_p17145 will be pay well and though [he]_p17146 swear much at the first [he]_p17146 agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell [him]_p17148 where horse and cart can be hired. [He]_p17149 go there and soon [he]_p17150 come again, [himself]_p17152 driving cart on which a great box this [he]_p17151 [himself]_p17153 lift down, though [it]_p17154 take several to put [it]_p17155 on truck for the ship. [He]_p17156 give much talk to captain as to how and where [his]_p17157 box is to be place but the captain like [it]_p17158 not and swear at [him]_p17160 in many tongues, and tell [him]_p17161 that if [he]_p17162 like [he]_p17163 can come and see where [it]_p17159 shall be. But [he]_p17164 say 'no' that [he]_p17165 come not yet, for that [he]_p17165 have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell [him]_p17167 that [he]_p17168 had better be quick, with blood, for that [his]_p17169 ship will leave the place, of blood, before the turn of the tide, with blood. Then the thin man smile and say that of course [he]_p17170 must go when [he]_p17171 think fit but [he]_p17171 will be surprise if [he]_p17172 go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make [him]_p17174 bow, and thank him, and say that [he]_p17176 will so far intrude on [his]_p17177 kindness as to come aboard before the sailing.",1,,36,
stoker_dracula," Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell [him]_p17178 that [he]_p17179 doesn't want no Frenchmen, with bloom upon [them]_p17180 and also with blood, in [his]_p17181 ship, with blood on [her]_p17182 also. And so, after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where [he]_p17183 might purchase ship forms, [he]_p17184 departed. ""No one knew where [he]_p17185 went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as [they]_p17186 said, for [they]_p17187 had something else to think of, well with blood again for [it]_p17188 soon became apparent to all that the [Czarina Catherine]_n2040 would not sail as was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and [it]_p17189 grew, and grew till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her. The captain swore polyglot, very polyglot, polyglot with bloom and blood but [he]_p17190 could do nothing. The water rose and rose and [he]_p17191 began to fear that [he]_p17192 would lose the tide altogether. [He]_p17193 was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and asked to see where [his]_p17194 box had been stowed. Then the captain replied that [he]_p17195 wished that [he]_p17196 and [his]_p17197 box, old and with much bloom and blood, were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where [it]_p17198 was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog. [He]_p17199 must have come off by himself, for none notice him.",1,,22,
stoker_dracula," Indeed [they]_p17200 thought not of [him]_p17201 for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again. [My]_p17202 friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as [they]_p17203 told how the captain's swears exceeded even [his]_p17204 usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour, [he]_p17205 found that few of [them]_p17206 had seen any of fog at all, except where [it]_p17207 lay round the wharf. However, the ship went out on the ebb tide and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth. [She]_p17208 was by then, when [they]_p17209 told us, well out to sea. ""And so, [my]_p17210 [dear Madam Mina]_n,2041 [it]_p17211 is that [we]_p17212 have to rest for a time, for [our]_p17213 enemy is on the sea, with the fog at [his]_p17214 command, on [his]_p17215 way to the Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go [she]_p17216 never so quick and when [we]_p17217 start [we]_p17218 go on land more quick, and [we]_p17218 meet [him]_p17220 there. [Our]_p17221 best hope is to come on [him]_p17222 when in the box between sunrise and sunset for then [he]_p17224 can make no struggle, and [we]_p17225 may deal with [him]_p17223 as [we]_p17226 should. There are days for us, in which [we]_p17227 can make ready [our]_p17228 plan. [We]_p17229 know all about where [he]_p17230 go for [we]_p17231 have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown [us]_p17232 invoices and all papers that can be. The box [we]_p17233 seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present [his]_p17234 credentials and so [our]_p17236 merchant friend will have done [his]_p17235 part.",1,,37,
stoker_dracula," When [he]_p17237 ask if there be any wrong, for that so, [he]_p17238 can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, [we]_p17239 say 'no' for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs. [It]_p17240 must be done by [us]_p17241 alone and in [our]_p17242 own way. "" When Dr [Van Helsing]_n2042 had done speaking, [I]_p17243 asked [him]_p17244 if [he]_p17245 were certain that the Count had remained on board the ship. [He]_p17246 replied: ""We have the best proof of that: [your]_p17247 own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning. "" [I]_p17248 asked [him]_p17251 again if [it]_p17252 were really necessary that [they]_p17253 should pursue the Count, for oh! [I]_p17249 dread Jonathan leaving me, and [I]_p17249 know that [he]_p17254 would surely go if the others went. [He]_p17255 answered in growing passion, at first quietly. As [he]_p17256 went on, however, [he]_p17257 grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end [we]_p17258 could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made [him]_p17259 so long a master amongst men:,   ""Yes, [it]_p17260 is necessary, necessary, necessary! For [your]_p17261 sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope where [he]_p17262 find himself, and in the short time when as yet [he]_p17263 was only as a body groping [his]_p17264 so small measure in darkness and not knowing. All this have [I]_p17265 told these others you, [my]_p17266 [dear Madam Mina]_n,2043 will learn [it]_p17268 in the phonograph of [my]_p17267 friend John, or in that of [your]_p17269 husband. [I]_p17270 have told [them]_p17271 how the measure of leaving [his]_p17272 own barren land, barren of peoples, and coming to a new land where life of man teems till [they]_p17273 are like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries.",2,,37,
stoker_dracula," Were another of the [Un-Dead]_n,2044 like him, to try to do what [he]_p17274 has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way. The very place, where [he]_p17275 have been alive, [Un-Dead]_n2045 for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way and in [himself]_p17276 were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike time [he]_p17277 was celebrate that [he]_p17278 have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man. In [him]_p17279 some vital principle have in strange way found [their]_p17280 utmost and as [his]_p17281 body keep strong and grow and thrive, so [his]_p17282 brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to [him]_p17283 for [it]_p17284 have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what [he]_p17285 is to us.",2,,12,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p17286 have infect you, oh, forgive me, [my]_p17289 [dear]_n,2046 that [I]_p17290 must say such but [it]_p17292 is for good of [you]_p17287 that [I]_p17291 speak. [He]_p17293 infect [you]_p17294 in such wise, that even if [he]_p17297 do no more, [you]_p17295 have only to live, to live in [your]_p17298 own old, sweet way and so in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction, shall make [you]_p17295 like to him. This must not be! [We]_p17299 have sworn together that [it]_p17300 must not. Thus are [we]_p17301 ministers of God's own wish: that the world, and men for whom [His]_p17302 Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame [Him]_n2047. [He]_p17303 have allowed [us]_p17304 to redeem one soul already, and [we]_p17305 go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more. Like [them]_p17306 [we]_p17308 shall travel towards the sunrise and like them, if [we]_p17309 fall, [we]_p17309 fall in good cause. "" [He]_p17311 paused and [I]_p17312 said:,   ""But will not the Count take [his]_p17314 rebuff wisely? Since [he]_p17315 has been driven from England, will [he]_p17316 not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which [he]_p17316 has been hunted?""  ""Aha!"" [he]_p17317 said, ""your simile of the tiger good, for me, and [I]_p17313 shall adopt him. [Your]_p17319 man-eater, as [they]_p17320 of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till [he]_p17321 get him. This that [we]_p17322 hunt from [our]_p17323 village is a tiger, too, a man-eater, and [he]_p17324 never cease to prowl. [Nay]_n,2048 in [himself]_p17325 [he]_p17326 is not one to retire and stay afar.",3,,39,
stoker_dracula," In [his]_p17327 life, [his]_p17328 living life, [he]_p17331 go over the [Turkey]_n2049 frontier and attack [his]_p17328 enemy on [his]_p17329 own ground [he]_p17332 be beaten back, but did [he]_p17332 stay? No! [He]_p17334 come again, and again, and again. Look at [his]_p17335 persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to [him]_p17336 [he]_p17337 have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does [he]_p17338 do? [He]_p17339 find out the place of all the world most of promise for him. Then [he]_p17340 deliberately set [himself]_p17341 down to prepare for the task. [He]_p17342 find in patience just how is [his]_p17343 strength, and what are [his]_p17344 powers. [He]_p17345 study new tongues. [He]_p17346 learn new social life new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since [he]_p17347 was. [His]_p17348 glimpse that [he]_p17349 have had, whet [his]_p17350 appetite only and enkeen [his]_p17351 desire. [Nay]_n,2050 [it]_p17352 help [him]_p17354 to grow as to [his]_p17356 brain for [it]_p17353 all prove to [him]_p17355 how right [he]_p17358 was at the first in [his]_p17357 surmises.",2,,32,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p17359 have done this alone all alone! from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may [he]_p17360 not do when the greater world of thought is open to him. [He]_p17361 that can smile at death, as [we]_p17362 know [him]_p17363 who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might [he]_p17364 not be in this old world of ours. But [we]_p17365 are pledged to set the world free. [Our]_p17366 toil must be in silence, and [our]_p17367 efforts all in secret for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what [they]_p17368 see, the doubting of wise men would be [his]_p17369 greatest strength. [It]_p17370 would be at once [his]_p17371 sheath and [his]_p17372 armour, and [his]_p17372 weapons to destroy us, [his]_p17373 enemies, who are willing to peril even [our]_p17375 own souls for the safety of one [we]_p17376 love, for the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God. "" After a general discussion [it]_p17377 was determined that for [to-night]_n2051 nothing be definitely settled that [we]_p17378 should all sleep on the facts, and try to think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, [we]_p17379 are to meet again, and, after making [our]_p17381 conclusions known to one another, [we]_p17380 shall decide on some definite cause of action. * * * * * [I]_p17382 feel a wonderful peace and rest [to-night]_n2052.",2,,24,

[Dr Seward]_n's2053 [Diary]_n2054. 5 October. , [We]_p17389 all rose early, and [I]_p17390 think that sleep did much for each and all of us. When [we]_p17391 met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of [us]_p17392 had ever expected to experience again. [It]_p17393 is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way, even by death, and [we]_p17394 fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as [we]_p17395 sat around the table, [my]_p17396 eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream.",2,,14,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p17397 was only when [I]_p17398 caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs Harker's forehead that [I]_p17399 was brought back to reality. Even now, when [I]_p17400 am gravely revolving the matter, [it]_p17401 is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all [our]_p17402 trouble is still existent. Even Mrs Harker seems to lose sight of [her]_p17403 trouble for whole spells [it]_p17406 is only now and again, when something recalls [it]_p17407 to [her]_p17404 mind, that [she]_p17408 thinks of [her]_p17404 terrible scar. [We]_p17409 are to meet here in [my]_p17410 study in half an hour and decide on [our]_p17411 course of action. [I]_p17412 see only one immediate difficulty, [I]_p17413 know [it]_p17415 by instinct rather than reason: [we]_p17416 shall all have to speak frankly and yet [I]_p17413 fear that in some mysterious way poor [Mrs Harker]_n's2055 tongue is tied. [I]_p17417 know that [she]_p17419 forms conclusions of [her]_p17421 own, and from all that has been [I]_p17418 can guess how brilliant and how true [they]_p17422 must be but [she]_p17420 will not, or cannot, give [them]_p17423 utterance. [I]_p17424 have mentioned this to [Van Helsing]_n,2056 and [he]_p17426 and [I]_p17425 are to talk [it]_p17427 over when [we]_p17428 are alone. [I]_p17429 suppose [it]_p17430 is some of that horrid poison which has got into [her]_p17431 veins beginning to work. The Count had [his]_p17432 own purposes when [he]_p17433 gave [her]_p17434 what [Van Helsing]_n2057 called ""the Vampire's baptism of blood. "" Well, there may be a poison that distils [itself]_p17435 out of good things in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery [we]_p17436 should not wonder at anything! One thing [I]_p17437 know: that if [my]_p17438 instinct be true regarding poor Mrs Harker's silences, then there is a terrible difficulty, an unknown danger, in the work before us.",3,,42,
stoker_dracula," The same power that compels [her]_p17439 silence may compel [her]_p17440 speech. [I]_p17441 dare not think further for so [I]_p17442 should in [my]_p17443 thoughts dishonour a noble woman! [Van Helsing]_n2058 is coming to [my]_p17444 study a little before the others. [I]_p17445 shall try to open the subject with him. * * * * *  Later. , When the [Professor]_n2059 came in, [we]_p17446 talked over the state of things. [I]_p17447 could see that [he]_p17448 had something on [his]_p17450 mind which [he]_p17449 wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little, [he]_p17451 said suddenly:, ""[Friend John]_n,2060 there is something that [you]_p17452 and [I]_p17453 must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate. Later, [we]_p17454 may have to take the others into [our]_p17455 confidence"" then [he]_p17457 stopped, so [I]_p17459 waited [he]_p17458 went on:, ""[Madam]_n2061 Mina, [our]_p17456 poor, [dear [Madam]_n2062 Mina]_n2063 is changing. "" A cold shiver ran through [me]_p17460 to find [my]_p17461 worst fears thus endorsed. [Van Helsing]_n2064 continued:, ""With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, [we]_p17462 must this time be warned before things go too far.",7,,24,
stoker_dracula," [Our]_p17463 task is now in reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. [I]_p17464 can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in [her]_p17465 face. [It]_p17466 is now but very, very slight but [it]_p17467 is to be seen if [we]_p17468 have eyes to notice without to prejudge. [Her]_p17469 teeth are some sharper, and at times [her]_p17470 eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to [her]_p17471 the silence now often as so [it]_p17472 was with Miss Lucy. [She]_p17473 did not speak, even when [she]_p17474 wrote that which [she]_p17475 wished to be known later. Now [my]_p17476 fear is this. If [it]_p17477 be that [she]_p17479 can, by [our]_p17483 hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is [it]_p17478 not more true that [he]_p17485 who have hypnotise [her]_p17488 first, and who have drink of [her]_p17489 very blood and make [her]_p17489 drink of his, should, if [he]_p17486 will, compel [her]_p17490 mind to disclose to [him]_p17493 that which [she]_p17480 know?"" [I]_p17494 nodded acquiescence [he]_p17486 went on:,   ""Then, what [we]_p17495 must do is to prevent this [we]_p17496 must keep [her]_p17490 ignorant of [our]_p17484 intent, and so [she]_p17480 cannot tell what [she]_p17481 know not. This is a painful task! Oh, so painful that [it]_p17497 heart-break [me]_p17499 to think of but [it]_p17498 must be. When to-day [we]_p17500 meet, [I]_p17502 must tell [her]_p17503 that for reason which [we]_p17501 will not to speak [she]_p17504 must not more be of [our]_p17505 council, but be simply guarded by us.",0,,43,
stoker_dracula," "" [He]_p17506 wiped [his]_p17507 forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which [he]_p17508 might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured. [I]_p17509 knew that [it]_p17512 would be some sort of comfort to [him]_p17514 if [I]_p17510 told [him]_p17515 that [I]_p17510 also had come to the same conclusion for at any rate [it]_p17513 would take away the pain of doubt. [I]_p17516 told him, and the effect was as [I]_p17517 expected. [It]_p17518 is now close to the time of [our]_p17519 general gathering. [Van Helsing]_n2065 has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and [his]_p17520 painful part of it. [I]_p17521 really believe [his]_p17522 purpose is to be able to pray alone. * * * * *  Later. , At the very outset of [our]_p17523 meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both [Van Helsing]_n2066 and myself. Mrs Harker had sent a message by [her]_p17524 husband to say that [she]_p17526 would not join [us]_p17528 at present, as [she]_p17527 thought [it]_p17530 better that [we]_p17531 should be free to discuss [our]_p17532 movements without [her]_p17525 presence to embarrass us. The [Professor]_n2067 and [I]_p17533 looked at each other for an instant, and somehow [we]_p17534 both seemed relieved.",3,,28,
stoker_dracula," For [my]_p17535 own part, [I]_p17536 thought that if [Mrs Harker]_n2068 realised the danger herself, [it]_p17537 was much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances [we]_p17538 agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to preserve silence in [our]_p17540 suspicions, until [we]_p17539 should have been able to confer alone again. [We]_p17541 went at once into [our]_p17542 Plan of Campaign. [Van Helsing]_n2069 roughly put the facts before [us]_p17543 first:, ""The [Czarina Catherine]_n2070 left the Thames yesterday morning. [It]_p17544 will take [her]_p17545 at the quickest speed [she]_p17546 has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna but [we]_p17547 can travel overland to the same place in three days. Now, if [we]_p17548 allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such weather influences as [we]_p17549 know that the Count can bring to bear and if [we]_p17549 allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us, then [we]_p17550 have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite safe, [we]_p17552 must leave here on 17th at latest. Then [we]_p17553 shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary. Of course [we]_p17554 shall all go armed, armed against evil things, spiritual as well as physical. "" Here Quincey Morris added:,   ""I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and [it]_p17555 may be that [he]_p17556 shall get there before us.",3,,22,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p17557 propose that [we]_p17558 add Winchesters to [our]_p17559 armament. [I]_p17560 have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around. Do [you]_p17561 remember, Art, when [we]_p17562 had the pack after [us]_p17564 at Tobolsk? What wouldn't [we]_p17563 have given then for a repeater apiece!"" ""Good!"" said [Van Helsing]_n,2071 ""Winchesters [it]_p17565 shall be. [Quincey]_n's2072 head is level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime [we]_p17566 can do nothing here and as [I]_p17567 think that [Varna]_n2073 is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon? [It]_p17568 is as long to wait here as there. To-night and to-morrow [we]_p17569 can get ready, and then, if all be well, [we]_p17570 four can set out on [our]_p17571 journey. ""  ""We four?"" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us. ""Of course!"" answered the [Professor]_n2074 quickly, ""you must remain to take care of [your]_p17572 so sweet wife!"" Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice:, ""Let [us]_p17573 talk of that part of [it]_p17574 in the morning. [I]_p17575 want to consult with Mina. "" [I]_p17576 thought that now was the time for [Van Helsing]_n2075 to warn [him]_p17577 not to disclose [our]_p17578 plans to [her]_p17579 but [he]_p17580 took no notice.",5,,24,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p17581 looked at [him]_p17582 significantly and coughed. For answer [he]_p17583 put [his]_p17584 finger on [his]_p17585 lips and turned away. Jonathan Harker's [Journal]_n2076. 5 October, afternoon. , For some time after [our]_p17586 meeting this morning [I]_p17587 could not think. The new phases of things leave [my]_p17588 mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina's determination not to take any part in the discussion set [me]_p17589 thinking and as [I]_p17590 could not argue the matter with her, [I]_p17591 could only guess. [I]_p17592 am as far as ever from a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled [me]_p17593 the last time [we]_p17594 talked of the subject [we]_p17595 agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us. [Mina]_n2077 is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child.",2,,15,
stoker_dracula," [Her]_p17596 lips are curved and [her]_p17597 face beams with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her. * * * * *  Later. , How strange [it]_p17598 all is. [I]_p17599 sat watching Mina's happy sleep, and came as near to being happy [myself]_p17602 as [I]_p17600 suppose [I]_p17600 shall ever be. As the evening drew on, and the earth took [its]_p17603 shadows from the sun sinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at once Mina opened [her]_p17604 eyes, and looking at [me]_p17605 tenderly, said:,   ""Jonathan, [I]_p17607 want [you]_p17608 to promise [me]_p17606 something on [your]_p17609 word of honour. A promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be broken though [I]_p17610 should go down on [my]_p17611 knees and implore [you]_p17612 with bitter tears. Quick, [you]_p17613 must make [it]_p17614 to [me]_p17615 at once. "" ""[Mina]_n,""2078 [I]_p17616 said, ""a promise like that, [I]_p17617 cannot make at once.",1,,22,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p17618 may have no right to make it. "" ""But, [dear]_n2079 one,"" [she]_p17619 said, with such spiritual intensity that [her]_p17620 eyes were like pole stars, ""it is [I]_p17624 who wish [it]_p17621 and [it]_p17622 is not for myself. [You]_p17625 can ask Dr [Van Helsing]_n2080 if [I]_p17626 am not right if [he]_p17627 disagrees [you]_p17628 may do as [you]_p17629 will. [Nay]_n,2081 more, if [you]_p17630 all agree, later, [you]_p17631 are absolved from the promise. ""  ""I promise!"" [I]_p17632 said, and for a moment [she]_p17634 looked supremely happy though to [me]_p17635 all happiness for [her]_p17636 was denied by the red scar on [her]_p17637 forehead. [She]_p17638 said:,   ""Promise [me]_p17639 that [you]_p17641 will not tell [me]_p17640 anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or implication not at any time whilst this remains to me!"" and [she]_p17642 solemnly pointed to the scar. [I]_p17643 saw that [she]_p17647 was in earnest, and said solemnly:,   ""I promise!"" and as [I]_p17644 said [it]_p17648 [I]_p17644 felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us. * * * * *  Later, midnight. , Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.",3,,28,
stoker_dracula," So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected somewhat with [her]_p17649 gaiety as a result even [I]_p17650 [myself]_p17651 felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs [us]_p17652 down were somewhat lifted. [We]_p17653 all retired early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child [it]_p17654 is a wonderful thing that [her]_p17655 faculty of sleep remains to [her]_p17656 in the midst of [her]_p17656 terrible trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least [she]_p17658 can forget [her]_p17659 care. Perhaps [her]_p17660 example may affect [me]_p17662 as [her]_p17661 gaiety did [to-night]_n2082. [I]_p17663 shall try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep. * * * * *  6 October, morning. , Another surprise.

stoker_dracula," [I]_p17666 thought that [it]_p17667 was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went for the [Professor]_n2085. [He]_p17668 had evidently expected some such call, for [I]_p17669 found [him]_p17670 dressed in [his]_p17671 room. [His]_p17672 door was ajar, so that [he]_p17673 could hear the opening of the door of [our]_p17674 room. [He]_p17675 came at once as [he]_p17676 passed into the room, [he]_p17677 asked [Mina]_n2086 if the others might come, too. ""No,"" [she]_p17678 said quite simply, ""it will not be necessary.

[I]_p17807 shall now settle up all [my]_p17808 affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come. * * * * *  Later. , [It]_p17809 is all done [my]_p17810 will is made, and all complete.",1,,19,
stoker_dracula," [Mina]_n2104 if [she]_p17811 survive is [my]_p17812 sole heir. If [it]_p17813 should not be so, then the others who have been so good to [us]_p17814 shall have remainder. [It]_p17815 is now drawing towards the sunset Mina's uneasiness calls [my]_p17816 attention to it. [I]_p17817 am sure that there is something on [her]_p17818 mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing times for [us]_p17819 all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger, some new pain, which, however, may in God's will be means to a good end. [I]_p17820 write all these things in the diary since [my]_p17821 darling must not hear [them]_p17822 now but if [it]_p17824 may be that [she]_p17825 can see [them]_p17823 again, [they]_p17826 shall be ready. [She]_p17827 is calling to me. CHAPTER XXV [DR]_n2105. SEWARD'S DIARY 11 October, [Evening]_n2106. , Jonathan Harker has asked [me]_p17828 to note this, as [he]_p17829 says [he]_p17830 is hardly equal to the task, and [he]_p17830 wants an exact record kept.",3,,21,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p17832 think that none of [us]_p17833 were surprised when [we]_p17834 were asked to see Mrs Harker a little before the time of sunset. [We]_p17835 have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to [her]_p17836 times of peculiar freedom  when [her]_p17837 old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting [her]_p17837 to action. This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows when, however, the freedom ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence. To-night, when [we]_p17840 met, [she]_p17841 was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle. [I]_p17842 put [it]_p17843 down [myself]_p17844 to [her]_p17845 making a violent effort at the earliest instant [she]_p17846 could do so. A very few minutes, however, gave [her]_p17847 complete control of [herself]_p17850 then, motioning [her]_p17848 husband to sit beside [her]_p17848 on the sofa where [she]_p17851 was half reclining, [she]_p17852 made the rest of [us]_p17853 bring chairs up close. Taking [her]_p17854 husband's hand in [hers]_p17855 began:, ""We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! [I]_p17856 know, [dear]_n2107 [I]_p17857 know that [you]_p17858 will always be with [me]_p17859 to the end. "" This was to [her]_p17860 husband whose hand had, as [we]_p17861 could see, tightened upon hers. ""In the morning [we]_p17862 go out upon [our]_p17863 task, and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us.",1,,31,
stoker_dracula," [You]_p17864 are going to be so good to [me]_p17865 as to take [me]_p17866 with you. [I]_p17867 know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whose soul perhaps is lost, no, no, not yet, but is at any rate at stake, [you]_p17868 will do. But [you]_p17869 must remember that [I]_p17871 am not as [you]_p17870 are. There is a poison in [my]_p17872 blood, in [my]_p17873 soul, which may destroy [me]_p17874 which must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, [my]_p17876 friends, [you]_p17878 know as well as [I]_p17880 do, that [my]_p17877 soul is at stake and though [I]_p17881 know there is one way out for me, [you]_p17879 must not and [I]_p17881 must not take it!"" [She]_p17883 looked appealingly to [us]_p17884 all in turn, beginning and ending with [her]_p17885 husband. ""What is that way?"" asked [Van Helsing]_n2108 in a hoarse voice. ""What is that way, which [we]_p17886 must not, may not, take?""  ""That [I]_p17887 may die now, either by [my]_p17888 own hand or that of another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought. [I]_p17889 know, and [you]_p17891 know, that were [I]_p17890 once dead [you]_p17892 could and would set free [my]_p17894 immortal spirit, even as [you]_p17892 did [my]_p17895 poor Lucy's. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the way [I]_p17896 would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the friends who love me. But death is not all.",1,,32,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p17897 cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before [us]_p17898 and a bitter task to be done, is God's will. Therefore, I, on [my]_p17899 part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!"" [We]_p17900 were all silent, for [we]_p17901 knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The faces of the others were set and Harker's grew ashen grey perhaps [he]_p17902 guessed better than any of [us]_p17903 what was coming. [She]_p17904 continued:,   ""This is what [I]_p17905 can give into the hotch-pot. "" [I]_p17906 could not but note the quaint legal phrase which [she]_p17907 used in such a place, and with all seriousness. ""What will each of [you]_p17908 give? [Your]_p17909 lives [I]_p17910 know,"" [she]_p17911 went on quickly, ""that is easy for brave men. [Your]_p17912 lives are God's, and [you]_p17913 can give [them]_p17915 back to [[Him]_n]_p179162109 but what will [you]_p17914 give to me?"" [She]_p17917 looked again questioningly, but this time avoided [her]_p17918 husband's face. [Quincey]_n2110 seemed to understand [he]_p17919 nodded, and [her]_p17920 face lit up. ""Then [I]_p17921 shall tell [you]_p17923 plainly what [I]_p17922 want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between [us]_p17924 now. [You]_p17925 must promise me, one and all, even you, [my]_p17928 beloved husband, that, should the time come, [you]_p17926 will kill me.",2,,31,
stoker_dracula," "" ""What is that time?"" The voice was [Quincey]_n's,2111 but [it]_p17929 was low and strained. ""When [you]_p17930 shall be convinced that [I]_p17931 am so changed that [it]_p17934 is better that [I]_p17932 die that [I]_p17932 may live. When [I]_p17935 am thus dead in the flesh, then [you]_p17936 will, without a moment's delay, drive a stake through [me]_p17937 and cut off [my]_p17939 head or do whatever else may be wanting to give [me]_p17938 rest!"" [Quincey]_n2112 was the first to rise after the pause. [He]_p17940 [knelt]_n2113 down before [her]_p17941 and taking [her]_p17942 hand in [his]_p17943 said solemnly:, ""I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man should to win such a distinction, but [I]_p17944 swear to [you]_p17948 by all that [I]_p17945 hold sacred and [dear]_n2114 that, should the time ever come, [I]_p17945 shall not flinch from the duty that [you]_p17949 have set us. And [I]_p17950 promise you, too, that [I]_p17951 shall make all certain, for if [I]_p17951 am only doubtful [I]_p17952 shall take [it]_p17954 that the time has come!""  ""My true friend!"" was all [she]_p17955 could say amid [her]_p17957 fast-falling tears, as, bending over, [she]_p17956 kissed [his]_p17958 hand. ""I swear the same, [my]_p17959 [dear Madam Mina]_n!""2115 said [Van Helsing]_n2116. ""And I!"" said [Lord Godalming]_n,2117 each of [them]_p17960 in turn kneeling to [her]_p17961 to take the oath. [I]_p17962 followed, myself. Then [her]_p17963 husband turned to [her]_p17964 wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of [his]_p17966 hair, and asked:,   ""And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, [my]_p17967 wife?""  ""You too, [my]_p17968 dearest,"" [she]_p17969 said, with infinite yearning of pity in [her]_p17964 voice and eyes. ""You must not shrink.",7,,40,
stoker_dracula," [You]_p17970 are nearest and dearest and all the world to [me]_p17971 [our]_p17972 souls are knit into one, for all life and all time. Think, [dear]_n,2118 that there have been times when brave men have killed [their]_p17973 wives and [their]_p17974 womenkind, to keep [them]_p17975 from falling into the hands of the enemy. [Their]_p17976 hands did not falter any the more because those that [they]_p17977 loved implored [them]_p17978 to slay them. [It]_p17980 is men's duty towards those whom [they]_p17981 love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, [my]_p17982 [dear]_n,2119 if [it]_p17983 is to be that [I]_p17985 must meet death at any hand, let [it]_p17984 be at the hand of [him]_p17986 that loves [me]_p17987 best. Dr [Van Helsing]_n,2120 [I]_p17988 have not forgotten [your]_p17989 mercy in poor Lucy's case to [him]_p17990 who loved"", [she]_p17992 stopped with a flying blush, and changed [her]_p17993 phrase, ""to [him]_p17991 who had best right to give [her]_p17994 peace. If that time shall come again, [I]_p17995 look to [you]_p17996 to make [it]_p17997 a happy memory of [my]_p17999 husband's life that [it]_p17998 was [his]_p18000 loving hand which set [me]_p18001 free from the awful thrall upon me. "" ""Again [I]_p18003 swear!"" came the [Professor]_n's2121 resonant voice. [Mrs Harker]_n2122 smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief [she]_p18004 leaned back and said:, ""And now one word of warning, a warning which [you]_p18005 must never forget: this time, if [it]_p18007 ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in such case [you]_p18006 must lose no time in using [your]_p18008 opportunity. At such a time [I]_p18009 [myself]_p18010 might be, nay! if the time ever comes, shall be, leagued with [your]_p18011 enemy against you. ""  ""One more request "" [she]_p18012 became very solemn as [she]_p18013 said this, ""it is not vital and necessary like the other, but [I]_p18014 want [you]_p18015 to do one thing for me, if [you]_p18016 will.",5,,45,
stoker_dracula," "" [We]_p18017 all acquiesced, but no one spoke there was no need to speak:, ""I want [you]_p18018 to read the [Burial]_n2123 Service. "" [She]_p18019 was interrupted by a deep groan from [her]_p18020 husband taking [his]_p18022 hand in hers, [she]_p18023 held [it]_p18024 over [her]_p18021 heart, and continued: ""You must read [it]_p18025 over [me]_p18026 some day. Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, [it]_p18027 will be a sweet thought to all or some of us. You, [my]_p18028 dearest, will [I]_p18031 hope read it, for then [it]_p18032 will be in [your]_p18034 voice in [my]_p18029 memory for ever, come what may!"" ""But oh, [my]_p18029 [dear]_n2124 one,"" [he]_p18035 pleaded, ""death is afar off from you. "" ""[Nay]_n,""2125 [she]_p18036 said, holding up a warning hand. ""I am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!""  ""Oh, [my]_p18039 wife, must [I]_p18037 read it?"" [he]_p18040 said, before [he]_p18041 began. ""It would comfort me, [my]_p18042 husband!"" was all [she]_p18043 said and [he]_p18045 began to read when [she]_p18044 had got the book ready. ""How can I, how could any one, tell of that strange scene, [its]_p18046 solemnity, [its]_p18047 gloom, [its]_p18047 sadness, [its]_p18048 horror and, withal, [its]_p18048 sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had [he]_p18051 seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady or heard the tender passion of [her]_p18054 husband's voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often [he]_p18052 had to pause, [he]_p18052 read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the [Dead]_n2126. I, [I]_p18055 cannot go on, words, and, v-voice, f-fail m-me!""  * * * * *  [She]_p18057 was right in [her]_p18058 instinct.",4,,39,
stoker_dracula," Strange as [it]_p18059 all was, bizarre as [it]_p18060 may hereafter seem even to [us]_p18062 who felt [its]_p18065 potent influence at the time, [it]_p18060 comforted [us]_p18063 much and the silence, which showed Mrs Harker's coming relapse from [her]_p18066 freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of [us]_p18063 as [we]_p18067 had dreaded. Jonathan Harker's [Journal]_n2127. 15 October, [Varna]_n2128. , [We]_p18068 left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for [us]_p18069 in the Orient [Express]_n2129. [We]_p18070 travelled night and day, arriving here at about five o'clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of [us]_p18071 came on to this hotel, ""the Odessus. "" The journey may have had incidents [I]_p18072 was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them. Until the [Czarina Catherine]_n2130 comes into port there will be no interest for [me]_p18073 in anything in the wide world. Thank God! [Mina]_n2131 is well, and looks to be getting stronger [her]_p18074 colour is coming back. [She]_p18075 sleeps a great deal throughout the journey [she]_p18076 slept nearly all the time.",5,,18,
stoker_dracula," Before sunrise and sunset, however, [she]_p18077 is very wakeful and alert and [it]_p18078 has become a habit for [Van Helsing]_n2132 to hypnotise [her]_p18079 at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and [he]_p18080 had to make many passes but now, [she]_p18081 seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed. [He]_p18082 seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and [her]_p18083 thoughts obey him. [He]_p18084 always asks [her]_p18085 what [she]_p18086 can see and hear. [She]_p18087 answers to the first:,   ""Nothing all is dark. "" And to the second:,   ""I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is high, [I]_p18088 can hear [it]_p18089 in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam. "" [It]_p18090 is evident that the [Czarina Catherine]_n2133 is still at sea, hastening on [her]_p18091 way to Varna. [Lord Godalming]_n2134 has just returned.",3,,15,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p18092 had four telegrams, one each day since [we]_p18093 started, and all to the same effect: that the [Czarina Catherine]_n2135 had not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere. [He]_p18094 had arranged before leaving London that [his]_p18095 agent should send [him]_p18096 every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. [He]_p18097 was to have a message even if [she]_p18098 were not reported, so that [he]_p18099 might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire. [We]_p18100 had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow [we]_p18101 are to see the Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if [we]_p18102 can, about getting on board the ship as soon as [she]_p18103 arrives. [Van Helsing]_n2136 says that [our]_p18104 chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if [he]_p18105 takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of [his]_p18106 own volition, and so cannot leave the ship. As [he]_p18107 dare not change to man's form without suspicion, which [he]_p18108 evidently wishes to avoid, [he]_p18108 must remain in the box. If, then, [we]_p18110 can come on board after sunrise, [he]_p18113 is at [our]_p18115 mercy  for [we]_p18111 can open the box and make sure of him, as [we]_p18111 did of poor Lucy, before [he]_p18114 wakes. What mercy [he]_p18116 shall get from [us]_p18117 will not count for much.",2,,26,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p18118 think that [we]_p18119 shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything, and [we]_p18120 are well supplied with money. [We]_p18121 have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without [our]_p18122 being warned, and [we]_p18123 shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, [I]_p18124 think!  * * * * *  16 October. , Mina's report still the same: lapping waves and rushing water, darkness and favouring winds. [We]_p18125 are evidently in good time, and when [we]_p18126 hear of the [Czarina Catherine]_n2137 [we]_p18127 shall be ready. As [she]_p18128 must pass the Dardanelles [we]_p18129 are sure to have some report. * * * * *  17 October. , Everything is pretty well fixed now, [I]_p18130 think, to welcome the Count on [his]_p18131 return from [his]_p18132 tour. [Godalming]_n2138 told the shippers that [he]_p18133 fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that [he]_p18134 might open [it]_p18137 at [his]_p18135 own risk.",2,,19,
stoker_dracula," The owner gave [him]_p18138 a paper telling the Captain to give [him]_p18139 every facility in doing whatever [he]_p18140 chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to [his]_p18141 agent at Varna. [We]_p18142 have seen the agent, who was much impressed with [Godalming]_n's2139 kindly manner to him, and [we]_p18143 are all satisfied that whatever [he]_p18144 can do to aid [our]_p18145 wishes will be done. [We]_p18146 have already arranged what to do in case [we]_p18147 get the box open. If the Count is there, [Van Helsing]_n2140 and Seward will cut off [his]_p18148 head at once and drive a stake through [his]_p18149 heart. Morris and [Godalming]_n2141 and [I]_p18150 shall prevent interference, even if [we]_p18151 have to use the arms which [we]_p18152 shall have ready. The Professor says that if [we]_p18153 can so treat the Count's body, [it]_p18154 will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But even if [it]_p18155 were not, [we]_p18156 should stand or fall by [our]_p18157 act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of [us]_p18158 and a rope. For myself, [I]_p18159 should take the chance only too thankfully if [it]_p18160 were to come. [We]_p18161 mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out [our]_p18162 intent.",3,,25,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p18163 have arranged with certain officials that the instant the [Czarina Catherine]_n2142 is seen, [we]_p18164 are to be informed by a special messenger. * * * * *  24 October. , A whole week of waiting. [Daily]_n2143 telegrams to [Godalming]_n,2144 but only the same story: ""Not yet reported. "" Mina's morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts. Telegram, October 24th. [Rufus Smith]_n,2145 Lloyd's, London, to [Lord Godalming]_n,2146 care of H. B. M. Vice-Consul, Varna.",5,,2,
stoker_dracula," ""[Czarina Catherine]_n2147 reported this morning from Dardanelles. "" [Dr Seward]_n's2148 [Diary]_n2149. 25 October. , How [I]_p18165 miss [my]_p18167 phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to [me]_p18168 but [Van Helsing]_n2150 says [I]_p18166 must. [We]_p18169 were all wild with excitement yesterday when [Godalming]_n2151 got [his]_p18170 telegram from Lloyd's. [I]_p18171 know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. [Mrs Harker]_n,2152 alone of [our]_p18172 party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, [it]_p18173 is not strange that [she]_p18175 did not for [we]_p18176 took special care not to let [her]_p18179 know anything about it, and [we]_p18177 all tried not to show any excitement when [we]_p18177 were in [her]_p18180 presence. In old days [she]_p18181 would, [I]_p18183 am sure, have noticed, no matter how [we]_p18184 might have tried to conceal [it]_p18185 but in this way [she]_p18182 is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon her, and though [she]_p18188 seems strong and well, and is getting back some of [her]_p18186 colour, [Van Helsing]_n2153 and [I]_p18189 are not satisfied.",7,,23,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p18190 talk of [her]_p18191 often [we]_p18192 have not, however, said a word to the others. [It]_p18193 would break poor Harker's heart, certainly [his]_p18194 nerve, if [he]_p18195 knew that [we]_p18196 had even a suspicion on the subject. [Van Helsing]_n2154 examines, [he]_p18197 tells me, [her]_p18199 teeth very carefully, whilst [she]_p18201 is in the hypnotic condition, for [he]_p18198 says that so long as [they]_p18202 do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her. If this change should come, [it]_p18203 would be necessary to take steps!. [We]_p18204 both know what those steps would have to be, though [we]_p18205 do not mention [our]_p18206 thoughts to each other. [We]_p18207 should neither of [us]_p18208 shrink from the task, awful though [it]_p18209 be to contemplate. ""Euthanasia"" is an excellent and a comforting word! [I]_p18210 am grateful to whoever invented it. [It]_p18211 is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the [Czarina Catherine]_n2155 has come from [London]_n2156. [She]_p18212 should therefore arrive some time in the morning but as [she]_p18213 cannot possibly get in before then, [we]_p18214 are all about to retire early. [We]_p18215 shall get up at one o'clock, so as to be ready.",3,,25,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  25 October, Noon. , No news yet of the ship's arrival. Mrs Harker's hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so [it]_p18216 is possible that [we]_p18217 may get news at any moment. [We]_p18218 men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who is calm [his]_p18219 hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago [I]_p18220 found [him]_p18221 whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which [he]_p18223 now always carries with him. [It]_p18224 will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that ""Kukri"" ever touches [his]_p18225 throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand! [Van Helsing]_n2157 and [I]_p18226 were a little alarmed about Mrs Harker to-day. About noon [she]_p18227 got into a sort of lethargy which [we]_p18228 did not like although [we]_p18229 kept silence to the others, [we]_p18229 were neither of [us]_p18231 happy about it. [She]_p18232 had been restless all the morning, so that [we]_p18233 were at first glad to know that [she]_p18234 was sleeping. When, however, [her]_p18235 husband mentioned casually that [she]_p18238 was sleeping so soundly that [he]_p18239 could not wake her, [we]_p18240 went to [her]_p18236 room to see for ourselves. [She]_p18241 was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that [we]_p18242 agreed that the sleep was better for [her]_p18243 than anything else. [Poor]_n2158 girl, [she]_p18244 has so much to forget that [it]_p18245 is no wonder that sleep, if [it]_p18246 brings oblivion to her, does [her]_p18247 good.",2,,30,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  Later. , [Our]_p18249 opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours [she]_p18250 woke up, [she]_p18251 seemed brighter and better than [she]_p18251 had been for days. At sunset [she]_p18253 made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever [he]_p18254 may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to [his]_p18255 destination. To [his]_p18256 doom, [I]_p18257 trust!  * * * * *  26 October. , Another day and no tidings of the [Czarina Catherine]_n2159. [She]_p18258 ought to be here by now. That [she]_p18259 is still journeying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same. [It]_p18260 is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog  some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port. [We]_p18261 must continue [our]_p18262 watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.",1,,14,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  27 October, Noon. , Most strange no news yet of the ship [we]_p18263 wait for. [Mrs Harker]_n2160 reported last night and this morning as usual: ""lapping waves and rushing water,"" though [she]_p18264 added that ""the waves were very faint. "" The telegrams from London have been the same: ""no further report. "" [Van Helsing]_n2161 is terribly anxious, and told [me]_p18265 just now that [he]_p18266 fears the Count is escaping us. [He]_p18267 added significantly:, ""I did not like that lethargy of [Madam Mina]_n's2162. Souls and memories can do strange things during trance. "" [I]_p18268 was about to ask [him]_p18269 more, but Harker just then came in, and [he]_p18270 held up a warning hand. [We]_p18271 must try [to-night]_n2163 at sunset to make [her]_p18272 speak more fully when in [her]_p18273 hypnotic state. * * * * *  28 October.",4,,11,
stoker_dracula," , Telegram. [Rufus Smith]_n,2164 London, to [Lord Godalming]_n,2165 care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna. ""[Czarina Catherine]_n2166 reported entering [Galatz]_n2167 at one o'clock to-day. "" [Dr Seward]_n's2168 [Diary]_n2169. 28 October. , When the telegram came announcing the arrival in [Galatz]_n2170 [I]_p18274 do not think [it]_p18275 was such a shock to any of [us]_p18276 as might have been expected. True, [we]_p18277 did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come but [I]_p18279 think [we]_p18278 all expected that something strange would happen.",7,,6,
stoker_dracula," The delay of arrival at Varna made [us]_p18280 individually satisfied that things would not be just as [we]_p18281 had expected [we]_p18282 only waited to learn where the change would occur. None the less, however, was [it]_p18283 a surprise. [I]_p18284 suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that [we]_p18285 believe against [ourselves]_p18287 that things will be as [they]_p18288 ought to be, not as [we]_p18286 should know that [they]_p18289 will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if [it]_p18290 be a will-o'-the-wisp to man. [It]_p18291 was an odd experience and [we]_p18292 all took [it]_p18293 differently. [Van Helsing]_n2171 raised [his]_p18294 hand over [his]_p18295 head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the [Almighty]_n2172 but [he]_p18297 said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with [his]_p18295 face sternly set. [Lord Godalming]_n2173 grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. [I]_p18298 was [myself]_p18299 half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. [Quincey]_n2174 Morris tightened [his]_p18300 belt with that quick movement which [I]_p18301 knew so well in [our]_p18302 old wandering days [it]_p18303 meant ""action. "" [Mrs Harker]_n2175 grew ghastly white, so that the scar on [her]_p18304 forehead seemed to burn, but [she]_p18306 folded [her]_p18305 hands meekly and looked up in prayer.",5,,27,
stoker_dracula," Harker smiled, actually smiled, the dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope but at the same time [his]_p18307 action belied [his]_p18308 words, for [his]_p18308 hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there. ""When does the next train start for [Galatz]_n?""2176 said [Van Helsing]_n2177 to [us]_p18310 generally. ""At 6:30 to-morrow morning!"" [We]_p18311 all started, for the answer came from [Mrs Harker]_n2178. ""How on earth do [you]_p18312 know?"" said [Art]_n2179. ""You forget, or perhaps [you]_p18313 do not know, though Jonathan does and so does Dr [Van Helsing]_n,2180 that [I]_p18314 am the train fiend. At home in [Exeter]_n2181 [I]_p18315 always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to [my]_p18316 husband. [I]_p18317 found [it]_p18319 so useful sometimes, that [I]_p18318 always make a study of the time-tables now. [I]_p18320 knew that if anything were to take [us]_p18322 to [Castle Dracula]_n2182 [we]_p18323 should go by [Galatz]_n,2183 or at any rate through Bucharest, so [I]_p18321 learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn, as the only train [to-morrow]_n2184 leaves as [I]_p18324 say. "" ""Wonderful woman!"" murmured the [Professor]_n2185.",10,,18,
stoker_dracula," ""Can't [we]_p18325 get a special?"" asked [Lord Godalming]_n2186. [Van Helsing]_n2187 shook [his]_p18326 head: ""I fear not. This land is very different from [yours]_p18327 or [mine]_p18328 even if [we]_p18329 did have a special, [it]_p18330 would probably not arrive as soon as [our]_p18331 regular train. Moreover, [we]_p18332 have something to prepare. [We]_p18333 must think. Now let [us]_p18334 organize. You, friend [Arthur]_n,2188 go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for [us]_p18335 to go in the morning. Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from [him]_p18336 letters to the agent in [Galatz]_n,2189 with authority to make search the ship just as [it]_p18337 was here. Morris Quincey, [you]_p18338 see the Vice-Consul, and get [his]_p18339 aid with [his]_p18340 fellow in Galatz and all [he]_p18341 can do to make [our]_p18342 way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. [John]_n2190 will stay with [Madam Mina]_n2191 and me, and [we]_p18343 shall consult.",6,,19,
stoker_dracula," For so if time be long [you]_p18344 may be delayed and [it]_p18345 will not matter when the sun set, since [I]_p18346 am here with [Madam]_n2192 to make report. ""  ""And I,"" said Mrs Harker brightly, and more like [her]_p18349 old self than [she]_p18350 had been for many a long day, ""shall try to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for [you]_p18351 as [I]_p18347 used to do. Something is shifting from [me]_p18352 in some strange way, and [I]_p18353 feel freer than [I]_p18354 have been of late!"" The three younger men looked happier at the moment as [they]_p18356 seemed to realise the significance of [her]_p18357 words but [Van]_n2193 Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. [We]_p18358 said nothing at the time, however. When the three men had gone out to [their]_p18359 tasks [Van Helsing]_n2194 asked Mrs Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find [him]_p18360 the part of Harker's journal at the Castle. [She]_p18361 went away to get [it]_p18362 when the door was shut upon [her]_p18363 [he]_p18364 said to me:,   ""We mean the same! speak out!""  ""There is some change. [It]_p18365 is a hope that makes [me]_p18366 sick, for [it]_p18367 may deceive us. ""  ""Quite so. Do [you]_p18368 know why [I]_p18369 asked [her]_p18371 to get the manuscript?""  ""No!"" said I, ""unless [it]_p18372 was to get an opportunity of seeing [me]_p18373 alone. ""  ""You are in part right, friend John, but only in part.",3,,27,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p18374 want to tell [you]_p18375 something. And oh, [my]_p18376 friend, [I]_p18377 am taking a great, a terrible, risk  but [I]_p18378 believe [it]_p18379 is right. In the moment when [Madam]_n2195 Mina said those words that arrest both [our]_p18380 understanding, an inspiration came to me. In the trance of three days ago the Count sent [her]_p18381 [his]_p18384 spirit to read [her]_p18382 mind or more like [he]_p18386 took [her]_p18382 to see [him]_p18387 in [his]_p18385 earth-box in the ship with water rushing, just as [it]_p18388 go free at rise and set of sun. [He]_p18389 learn then that [we]_p18390 are here for [she]_p18391 have more to tell in [her]_p18392 open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as [he]_p18393 is, in [his]_p18395 coffin-box. Now [he]_p18396 make [his]_p18397 most effort to escape us. At present [he]_p18398 want [her]_p18399 not. ""He is sure with [his]_p18400 so great knowledge that [she]_p18403 will come at [his]_p18401 call  but [he]_p18405 cut [her]_p18407 off, take her, as [he]_p18406 can do, out of [his]_p18401 own power, that so [she]_p18404 come not to him. Ah! there [I]_p18409 have hope that [our]_p18410 man-brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come higher than [his]_p18412 child-brain that lie in [his]_p18413 tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to [our]_p18411 stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina not a word to [her]_p18414 of [her]_p18415 trance! [She]_p18421 know [it]_p18422 not and [it]_p18423 would overwhelm [her]_p18415 and make despair just when [we]_p18424 want all [her]_p18416 hope, all [her]_p18416 courage when most [we]_p18425 want all [her]_p18416 great brain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give her, and which [he]_p18426 may not take away altogether, though [he]_p18427 think not so.",1,,51,
stoker_dracula," Hush! let [me]_p18428 speak, and [you]_p18429 shall learn. Oh, John, [my]_p18430 friend, [we]_p18431 are in awful straits. [I]_p18432 fear, as [I]_p18433 never feared before. [We]_p18434 can only trust the good God. Silence! here [she]_p18435 comes!"" [I]_p18436 thought that the [Professor]_n2196 was going to break down and have hysterics, just as [he]_p18437 had when Lucy died, but with a great effort [he]_p18438 controlled [himself]_p18439 and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs Harker tripped into the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of [her]_p18440 misery. As [she]_p18441 came in, [she]_p18442 handed a number of sheets of typewriting to [Van Helsing]_n2197. [He]_p18443 looked over [them]_p18444 gravely, [his]_p18445 face brightening up as [he]_p18446 read. Then holding the pages between [his]_p18447 finger and thumb [he]_p18448 said:, ""[Friend John]_n,2198 to [you]_p18449 with so much of experience already, and you, too, [dear Madam Mina]_n,2199 that are [young]_n,2200 here is a lesson: do not fear ever to think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in [my]_p18451 brain, but [I]_p18452 fear to let [him]_p18453 loose [his]_p18454 wings. Here now, with more knowledge, [I]_p18455 go back to where that half-thought come from and [I]_p18456 find that [he]_p18457 be no half-thought at all that be a whole thought, though so [young]_n2201 that [he]_p18458 is not yet strong to use [his]_p18459 little wings.",6,,31,
stoker_dracula," Nay, like the ""Ugly Duck"" of [my]_p18460 friend [Hans Andersen]_n,2202 [he]_p18461 be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for [him]_p18462 to try them. See [I]_p18463 read here what Jonathan have written:, ""That other of [his]_p18464 race who, in a later age, again and again, brought [his]_p18465 forces over The Great River into [Turkey Land]_n2203 who, when [he]_p18467 was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though [he]_p18468 had to come alone from the bloody field where [his]_p18465 troops were being slaughtered, since [he]_p18468 knew that [he]_p18469 alone could ultimately triumph. ""  ""What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count's child-thought see nothing therefore [he]_p18471 speak so free. [Your]_p18472 man-thought see nothing [my]_p18473 man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what [it]_p18474 mean, what [it]_p18475 might mean. Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature's course [they]_p18476 move on [their]_p18478 way and [they]_p18477 touch, then pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues. Is [it]_p18479 not so? Well, [I]_p18480 shall explain. To begin, have [you]_p18481 ever study the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No. ' You, [John]_n,2204 yes for [it]_p18482 is a study of insanity. You, no, [Madam Mina]_n2205 for crime touch [you]_p18483 not, not but once.",4,,24,
stoker_dracula," Still, [your]_p18484 mind works true, and argues not a particulari ad universale. There is this peculiarity in criminals. [It]_p18485 is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know [it]_p18486 empirically, that [it]_p18487 is. That is to be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime, that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other. This criminal has not full man-brain. [He]_p18488 is clever and cunning and resourceful but [he]_p18489 be not of man-stature as to brain. [He]_p18490 be of child-brain in much. Now this criminal of [ours]_p18491 is predestinate to crime also he, too, have child-brain, and [it]_p18494 is of the child to do what [he]_p18492 have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically and when [he]_p18495 learn to do, then there is to [him]_p18496 the ground to start from to do more.",0,,12,
stoker_dracula," 'Dos pou sto,' said Archimedes. 'Give [me]_p18497 a fulcrum, and [I]_p18498 shall move the world!' To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain and until [he]_p18500 have the purpose to do more, [he]_p18501 continue to do the same again every time, just as [he]_p18501 have done before! Oh, [my]_p18503 [dear]_n,2206 [I]_p18499 see that [your]_p18504 eyes are opened, and that to [you]_p18505 the lightning flash show all the leagues,"" for Mrs Harker began to clap [her]_p18506 hands and [her]_p18507 eyes sparkled. [He]_p18508 went on:,   ""Now [you]_p18509 shall speak. Tell [us]_p18510 two dry men of science what [you]_p18511 see with those so bright eyes. "" [He]_p18512 took [her]_p18513 hand and held [it]_p18514 whilst [she]_p18515 spoke. [His]_p18516 finger and thumb closed on [her]_p18517 pulse, as [I]_p18518 thought instinctively and unconsciously, as [she]_p18519 spoke:,   ""The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and qu criminal [he]_p18520 is of imperfectly formed mind. Thus, in a difficulty [he]_p18521 has to seek resource in habit. [His]_p18522 past is a clue, and the one page of [it]_p18523 that [we]_p18524 know, and that from [his]_p18525 own lips, tells that once before, when in what Mr Morris would call a 'tight place,' [he]_p18527 went back to [his]_p18526 own country from the land [he]_p18528 had tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared [himself]_p18529 for a new effort. [He]_p18530 came again better equipped for [his]_p18531 work and won.",1,,35,
stoker_dracula," So [he]_p18532 came to London to invade a new land. [He]_p18533 was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and [his]_p18534 existence in danger, [he]_p18536 fled back over the sea to [his]_p18535 home just as formerly [he]_p18537 had fled back over the Danube from [Turkey Land]_n2207. "" ""Good, good! oh, [you]_p18538 so clever lady!"" said [Van Helsing]_n,2208 enthusiastically, as [he]_p18539 stooped and kissed [her]_p18540 hand. A moment later [he]_p18541 said to me, as calmly as though [we]_p18542 had been having a sick-room consultation:,   ""Seventy-two only and in all this excitement. [I]_p18543 have hope. "" Turning to [her]_p18544 again, [he]_p18545 said with keen expectation:,   ""But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if [you]_p18546 will. Be not afraid [John]_n2209 and [I]_p18547 know. [I]_p18548 do in any case, and shall tell [you]_p18549 if [you]_p18550 are right. Speak, without fear!""  ""I will try to but [you]_p18553 will forgive [me]_p18554 if [I]_p18551 seem egotistical.",3,,22,
stoker_dracula," "" ""[Nay]_n!2210 fear not, [you]_p18555 must be egotist, for [it]_p18557 is of [you]_p18556 that [we]_p18558 think. ""  ""Then, as [he]_p18559 is criminal [he]_p18560 is selfish and as [his]_p18562 intellect is small and [his]_p18563 action is based on selfishness, [he]_p18560 confines [himself]_p18564 to one purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As [he]_p18565 fled back over the Danube, leaving [his]_p18567 forces to be cut to pieces, so now [he]_p18566 is intent on being safe, careless of all. So [his]_p18568 own selfishness frees [my]_p18569 soul somewhat from the terrible power which [he]_p18570 acquired over [me]_p18571 on that dreadful night. [I]_p18572 felt it! Oh, [I]_p18573 felt it! Thank God, for [His]_p18577 great mercy! [My]_p18578 soul is freer than [it]_p18574 has been since that awful hour and all that haunts [me]_p18579 is a fear lest in some trance or dream [he]_p18580 may have used [my]_p18581 knowledge for [his]_p18582 ends.

But [his]_p18590 child-mind only saw so far and [it]_p18593 may be that, as ever is in God's [Providence]_n,2213 the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for [his]_p18591 selfish good, turns out to be [his]_p18591 chiefest harm. The hunter is taken in [his]_p18594 own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that [he]_p18595 think [he]_p18596 is free from every trace of [us]_p18598 all, and that [he]_p18596 has escaped [us]_p18599 with so many hours to him, then [his]_p18602 selfish child-brain will whisper [him]_p18600 to sleep.",4,,44,
stoker_dracula," [He]_p18603 think, too, that as [he]_p18604 cut [himself]_p18607 off from knowing [your]_p18608 mind, there can be no knowledge of [him]_p18610 to [you]_p18612 there is where [he]_p18605 fail! That terrible baptism of blood which [he]_p18605 give [you]_p18613 makes [you]_p18613 free to go to [him]_p18611 in spirit, as [you]_p18614 have as yet done in [your]_p18609 times of freedom, when the sun rise and set. At such times [you]_p18616 go by [my]_p18619 volition and not by [his]_p18620  and this power to good of [you]_p18617 and others, as [you]_p18617 have won from [your]_p18622 suffering at [his]_p18621 hands. This is now all the more precious that [he]_p18623 know [it]_p18624 not, and to guard [himself]_p18625 have even cut [himself]_p18626 off from [his]_p18627 knowledge of [our]_p18628 where. We, however, are not selfish, and [we]_p18629 believe that God is with [us]_p18630 through all this blackness, and these many dark hours. [We]_p18631 shall follow [him]_p18632 and [we]_p18634 shall not flinch even if [we]_p18635 peril [ourselves]_p18637 that [we]_p18635 become like him. [Friend John]_n,2214 this has been a great hour and [it]_p18638 have done much to advance [us]_p18639 on [our]_p18640 way.

""  And so [I]_p18649 have written [it]_p18650 whilst [we]_p18651 wait [their]_p18652 return, and Mrs Harker has written with [her]_p18653 typewriter all since [she]_p18654 brought the MS. to us. CHAPTER XXVI [DR]_n2215.",2,,51,
stoker_dracula," SEWARD'S [DIARY]_n2216 29 October. , This is written in the train from Varna to [Galatz]_n2217. Last night [we]_p18655 all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of [us]_p18656 had done [his]_p18657 work as well as [he]_p18658 could so far as thought, and endeavour, and opportunity go, [we]_p18659 are prepared for the whole of [our]_p18661 journey, and for [our]_p18662 work when [we]_p18660 get to [Galatz]_n2218. When the usual time came round Mrs Harker prepared [herself]_p18663 for [her]_p18664 hypnotic effort and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of [Van Helsing]_n2219 than has been usually necessary, [she]_p18665 sank into the trance. Usually [she]_p18666 speaks on a hint but this time the [Professor]_n2220 had to ask [her]_p18667 questions, and to ask [them]_p18669 pretty resolutely, before [we]_p18670 could learn anything at last [her]_p18668 answer came:, ""I can see nothing [we]_p18671 are still there are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. [I]_p18672 can hear men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere the echo of [it]_p18673 seems far away. There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged along. What is this? There is a gleam of light [I]_p18674 can feel the air blowing upon me.",5,,20,
stoker_dracula," ""  Here [she]_p18675 stopped. [She]_p18676 had risen, as if impulsively, from where [she]_p18677 lay on the sofa, and raised both [her]_p18678 hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a weight. [Van Helsing]_n2221 and [I]_p18679 looked at each other with understanding. [Quincey]_n2222 raised [his]_p18680 eyebrows slightly and looked at [her]_p18682 intently, whilst Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of [his]_p18681 Kukri. There was a long pause. [We]_p18683 all knew that the time when [she]_p18684 could speak was passing but [we]_p18685 felt that [it]_p18686 was useless to say anything. Suddenly [she]_p18687 sat up, and, as [she]_p18688 opened [her]_p18689 eyes, said sweetly:,   ""Would none of [you]_p18691 like a cup of tea? [You]_p18692 must all be so tired!"" [We]_p18693 could only make [her]_p18690 happy, and so acquiesced. [She]_p18694 bustled off to get tea when [she]_p18695 had gone [Van Helsing]_n2223 said:, ""You see, [my]_p18696 friends. [He]_p18697 is close to land: [he]_p18698 has left [his]_p18699 earth-chest. But [he]_p18700 has yet to get on shore.",3,,26,
stoker_dracula," In the night [he]_p18701 may lie hidden somewhere but if [he]_p18702 be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, [he]_p18702 cannot achieve the land. In such case [he]_p18704 can, if [it]_p18706 be in the night, change [his]_p18707 form and can jump or fly on shore, as [he]_p18705 did at [Whitby]_n2224. But if the day come before [he]_p18708 get on shore, then, unless [he]_p18709 be carried [he]_p18709 cannot escape. And if [he]_p18711 be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if [he]_p18712 escape not on shore [to-night]_n,2225 or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him. [We]_p18713 may then arrive in time for if [he]_p18714 escape not at night [we]_p18717 shall come on [him]_p18718 in daytime, boxed up and at [our]_p18719 mercy for [he]_p18715 dare not be [his]_p18720 true self, awake and visible, lest [he]_p18715 be discovered. ""  There was no more to be said, so [we]_p18721 waited in patience until the dawn  at which time [we]_p18722 might learn more from Mrs Harker. Early this morning [we]_p18723 listened, with breathless anxiety, for [her]_p18724 response in [her]_p18725 trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before and when [it]_p18726 came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that [we]_p18727 began to despair. [Van Helsing]_n2226 seemed to throw [his]_p18728 whole soul into the effort at last, in obedience to [his]_p18729 will [she]_p18730 made reply:, ""All is dark.",3,,30,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p18731 hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as of wood on wood. "" [She]_p18732 paused, and the red sun shot up. [We]_p18733 must wait till [to-night]_n2227. And so [it]_p18734 is that [we]_p18735 are travelling towards [Galatz]_n2228 in an agony of expectation. [We]_p18736 are due to arrive between two and three in the morning  but already, at Bucharest, [we]_p18737 are three hours late, so [we]_p18738 cannot possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus [we]_p18739 shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs Harker either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening. * * * * *  Later. , Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately [it]_p18740 came at a time when there was no distraction for had [it]_p18741 occurred whilst [we]_p18742 were at a station, [we]_p18743 might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning.",2,,13,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p18744 am in fear that [her]_p18745 power of reading the Count's sensations may die away, just when [we]_p18746 want [it]_p18747 most. [It]_p18748 seems to [me]_p18749 that [her]_p18750 imagination is beginning to work. Whilst [she]_p18751 has been in the trance hitherto [she]_p18752 has confined [herself]_p18753 to the simplest of facts. If this goes on [it]_p18754 may ultimately mislead us. If [I]_p18755 thought that the Count's power over [her]_p18757 would die away equally with [her]_p18758 power of knowledge [it]_p18759 would be a happy thought but [I]_p18756 am afraid that [it]_p18760 may not be so. When [she]_p18761 did speak, [her]_p18762 words were enigmatical:,   ""Something is going out [I]_p18763 can feel [it]_p18764 pass [me]_p18765 like a cold wind. [I]_p18766 can hear, far off, confused sounds, as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves. "" [She]_p18767 stopped and a shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till, at the end, [she]_p18768 shook as though in a palsy. [She]_p18769 said no more, even in answer to the [Professor]_n's2229 imperative questioning. When [she]_p18770 woke from the trance, [she]_p18771 was cold, and exhausted, and languid but [her]_p18772 mind was all alert.",1,,29,
stoker_dracula," [She]_p18773 could not remember anything, but asked what [she]_p18774 had said  when [she]_p18775 was told, [she]_p18775 pondered over [it]_p18777 deeply for a long time and in silence. * * * * *  30 October, 7 a. m. , [We]_p18778 are near [Galatz]_n2230 now, and [I]_p18779 may not have time to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by [us]_p18780 all. Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance, [Van Helsing]_n2231 began [his]_p18781 passes earlier than usual. [They]_p18782 produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when [she]_p18783 yielded with a still greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The [Professor]_n2232 lost no time in [his]_p18784 questioning [her]_p18785 answer came with equal quickness:, ""All is dark. [I]_p18786 hear water swirling by, level with [my]_p18787 ears, and the creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off.",3,,15,
stoker_dracula," There is another sound, a queer one like, , "" [She]_p18788 stopped and grew white, and whiter still. ""Go on go on! Speak, [I]_p18789 command you!"" said [Van Helsing]_n2233 in an agonised voice. At the same time there was despair in [his]_p18790 eyes, for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs Harker's pale face. [She]_p18791 opened [her]_p18792 eyes, and [we]_p18793 all started as [she]_p18794 said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern:, ""Oh, [Professor]_n,2234 why ask [me]_p18795 to do what [you]_p18796 know [I]_p18797 can't? [I]_p18798 don't remember anything. "" Then, seeing the look of amazement on [our]_p18799 faces, [she]_p18800 said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look:, ""What have [I]_p18801 said? What have [I]_p18802 done? [I]_p18802 know nothing, only that [I]_p18803 was lying here, half asleep, and heard [you]_p18809 say go on! speak, [I]_p18803 command you!' [It]_p18813 seemed so funny to hear [you]_p18810 order [me]_p18814 about, as if [I]_p18803 were a bad child!"" ""Oh, [Madam]_n2235 Mina,"" [he]_p18815 said, sadly, ""it is proof, if proof be needed, of how [I]_p18804 love and honour you, when a word for [your]_p18818 good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because [it]_p18816 is to order [her]_p18819 whom [I]_p18804 am proud to obey!"" The whistles are sounding [we]_p18820 are nearing [Galatz]_n2236. [We]_p18821 are on fire with anxiety and eagerness. Mina Harker's [Journal]_n2237. 30 October. , Mr Morris took [me]_p18822 to the hotel where [our]_p18823 rooms had been ordered by telegraph, [he]_p18824 being the one who could best be spared, since [he]_p18825 does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed much as [they]_p18826 had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice-Consul, as [his]_p18827 rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official, [we]_p18828 being in extreme hurry.",5,,38,
stoker_dracula," Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the [Czarina Catherine]_n2238. * * * * *  Later. , [Lord Godalming]_n2239 has returned. The Consul is away, and the Vice-Consul sick so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk. [He]_p18829 was very obliging, and offered to do anything in [his]_p18830 power. Jonathan Harker's [Journal]_n2240. 30 October. , At nine o'clock [Dr Van Helsing]_n,2241 [Dr Seward]_n,2242 and [I]_p18831 called on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood. [They]_p18832 had received a wire from London, in answer to [Lord Godalming]_n's2243 telegraphed request, asking [us]_p18833 to show [them]_p18834 any civility in [their]_p18835 power.",6,,7,
stoker_dracula," [They]_p18836 were more than kind and courteous, and took [us]_p18837 at once on board the [Czarina Catherine]_n,2244 which lay at anchor out in the river harbour. There [we]_p18838 saw the [Captain]_n,2245 [Donelson]_n2246 by name, who told [us]_p18839 of [his]_p18840 voyage. [He]_p18841 said that in all [his]_p18842 life [he]_p18843 had never had so favourable a run. ""Man!"" [he]_p18844 said, ""but [it]_p18845 made [us]_p18847 afeard, for [we]_p18848 expeckit that [we]_p18849 should have to pay for [it]_p18846 wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up the average. It's no canny to run [frae London]_n2247 to the [Black Sea wi]_n'2248 a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil [himself]_p18850 were blawin' on yer sail for [his]_p18851 ain purpose. An' a' the time [we]_p18852 could no speer a thing. Gin [we]_p18853 were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on [us]_p18856 and travelled wi' us, till when after [it]_p18858 had lifted and [we]_p18854 looked out, the deil a thing could [we]_p18854 see. [We]_p18859 ran by [Gibraltar wi'oot bein]_n'2249 able to signal an' till [we]_p18860 came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get [our]_p18862 permit to pass, [we]_p18861 never were within hail o' aught. At first [I]_p18863 inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted but whiles, [I]_p18864 thocht that if the Deil was minded to get [us]_p18865 into the [Black Sea]_n2250 quick, [he]_p18866 was like to do [it]_p18867 whether [we]_p18868 would or no. If [we]_p18869 had a quick voyage [it]_p18870 would be no to [our]_p18871 miscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to [our]_p18872 traffic an' the Old [Mon]_n2251 who had served [his]_p18873 ain purpose wad be decently grateful to [us]_p18874 for no hinderin' him.",8,,38,
stoker_dracula," "" This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, aroused [Van Helsing]_n,2252 who said:, ""Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than [he]_p18875 is thought by some and [he]_p18876 know when [he]_p18876 meet [his]_p18878 match!"" The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on:, ""When [we]_p18879 got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble some o' them, the Roumanians, came and asked [me]_p18881 to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before [we]_p18880 had started [frae]_n2253 London. [I]_p18882 had seen [them]_p18883 speer at the fellow, and put out [their]_p18884 twa fingers when [they]_p18885 saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! [I]_p18886 sent [them]_p18889 aboot [their]_p18890 business pretty quick but as just after a fog closed in on [us]_p18891 [I]_p18887 felt a wee bit as [they]_p18892 did anent something, though [I]_p18887 wouldn't say [it]_p18893 was agin the big box. Well, on [we]_p18894 went, and as the fog didn't let up for five days [I]_p18895 joost let the wind carry [us]_p18896 for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres, well, [he]_p18897 would fetch [it]_p18898 up a'reet. An' if [he]_p18899 didn't, well, we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, [we]_p18900 had a fair way and deep water all the time and two days ago, when the mornin' sun came through the fog, [we]_p18901 found [ourselves]_p18902 just in the river opposite [Galatz]_n2254. The Roumanians were wild, and wanted [me]_p18903 right or wrong to take out the box and fling [it]_p18904 in the river. [I]_p18905 had to argy wi' [them]_p18907 aboot [it]_p18910 wi' a handspike an' when the last o' [them]_p18908 rose off the deck wi' [his]_p18911 head in [his]_p18912 hand, [I]_p18906 had convinced [them]_p18908 that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of [my]_p18913 owners were better in [my]_p18914 hands than in the river Danube. [They]_p18915 had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as [it]_p18916 was marked [Galatz]_n2255 via Varna, [I]_p18918 thocht I'd let [it]_p18917 lie till [we]_p18920 discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. [We]_p18921 didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came aboard wi' an order, written to [him]_p18922 from England, to receive a box marked for one [Count Dracula]_n2256.",5,,47,
stoker_dracula," Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to [his]_p18923 hand. [He]_p18924 had [his]_p18925 papers a' reet, an' glad [I]_p18926 was to be rid o' the dam' thing, for [I]_p18927 was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' [it]_p18928 was nane [ither]_n2257 than that same!"" ""What was the name of the man who took it?"" asked Dr [Van Helsing]_n2258 with restrained eagerness. ""I'll be tellin' [ye]_p18930 quick!"" [he]_p18931 answered, and, stepping down to [his]_p18932 cabin, produced a receipt signed ""Immanuel [Hildesheim]_n2259. "" [Burgen-strasse]_n2260 16 was the address. [We]_p18933 found out that this was all the Captain knew so with thanks [we]_p18934 came away. [We]_p18935 found [Hildesheim]_n2261 in [his]_p18936 office, a Hebrew of rather the [Adelphi]_n2262 [Theatre]_n2263 type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. [His]_p18937 arguments were pointed with specie, [we]_p18938 doing the punctuation, and with a little bargaining [he]_p18939 told [us]_p18941 what [he]_p18940 knew. This turned out to be simple but important. [He]_p18942 had received a letter from Mr [de]_n2264 [Ville]_n2265 of [London]_n,2266 telling [him]_p18943 to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which would arrive at [Galatz]_n2267 in the [Czarina Catherine]_n2268.",12,,20,
stoker_dracula," This [he]_p18944 was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the [Slovaks]_n2269 who traded down the river to the port. [He]_p18945 had been paid for [his]_p18946 work by an [English]_n2270 bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the [Danube International Bank]_n2271. When Skinsky had come to him, [he]_p18949 had taken [him]_p18947 to the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all [he]_p18950 knew. [We]_p18951 then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of [his]_p18952 neighbours, who did not seem to bear [him]_p18953 any affection, said that [he]_p18954 had gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by [his]_p18955 landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in [English]_n2272 money. This had been between ten and eleven o'clock last night. [We]_p18956 were at a standstill again. Whilst [we]_p18957 were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of [St]_n2273.",5,,13,
stoker_dracula," Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal. Those [we]_p18958 had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out ""This is the work of a Slovak!"" [We]_p18960 hurried away lest [we]_p18959 should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained. As [we]_p18961 came home [we]_p18962 could arrive at no definite conclusion. [We]_p18963 were all convinced that the box was on [its]_p18964 way, by water, to somewhere but where that might be [we]_p18965 would have to discover. With heavy hearts [we]_p18966 came home to the hotel to [Mina]_n2274. When [we]_p18967 met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again into [our]_p18968 confidence. Things are getting desperate, and [it]_p18969 is at least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, [I]_p18970 was released from [my]_p18971 promise to her.

stoker_dracula," , [They]_p18972 were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till [they]_p18973 had some rest so [I]_p18974 asked [them]_p18976 all to lie down for half an hour whilst [I]_p18975 should enter everything up to the moment. [I]_p18977 feel so grateful to the man who invented the ""Traveller's"" typewriter, and to Mr Morris for getting this one for me.

[He]_p19020 evidently fears discovery or interference, in the state of helplessness in which [he]_p19021 must be, confined as [he]_p19022 is between dawn and sunset in [his]_p19023 wooden box. (b) How is [he]_p19024 to be taken?, Here a process of exclusions may help us. By road, by rail, by water?  1. By Road. , There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the city. (x) There are people and people are curious, and investigate. A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.",1,,11,
stoker_dracula," (y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass. (z) [His]_p19025 pursuers might follow. This is [his]_p19026 highest fear and in order to prevent [his]_p19027 being betrayed [he]_p19029 has repelled, so far as [he]_p19030 can, even [his]_p19027 victim, me!  2. By [Rail]_n2283. , There is no one in charge of the box. [It]_p19031 would have to take [its]_p19032 chance of being delayed and delay would be fatal, with enemies on the track. True, [he]_p19033 might escape at night but what would [he]_p19034 be, if left in a strange place with no refuge that [he]_p19034 could fly to? This is not what [he]_p19035 intends and [he]_p19035 does not mean to risk it. 3. By [Water]_n2284. , Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger in another.",2,,13,
stoker_dracula," On the water [he]_p19038 is powerless except at night even then [he]_p19039 can only summon fog and storm and snow and [his]_p19040 wolves. But were [he]_p19041 wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless and [he]_p19042 would indeed be lost. [He]_p19043 could have the vessel drive to land but if [it]_p19044 were unfriendly land, wherein [he]_p19045 was not free to move, [his]_p19046 position would still be desperate. [We]_p19047 know from the record that [he]_p19048 was on the water so what [we]_p19049 have to do is to ascertain what water. The first thing is to realise exactly what [he]_p19050 has done as yet [we]_p19051 may, then, get a light on what [his]_p19052 later task is to be. Firstly. , [We]_p19053 must differentiate between what [he]_p19054 did in London as part of [his]_p19057 general plan of action, when [he]_p19055 was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best [he]_p19055 could. Secondly [we]_p19058 must see, as well as [we]_p19059 can surmise [it]_p19061 from the facts [we]_p19059 know of, what [he]_p19062 has done here. As to the first, [he]_p19063 evidently intended to arrive at [Galatz]_n,2285 and sent invoice to Varna to deceive [us]_p19064 lest [we]_p19065 should ascertain [his]_p19066 means of exit from England [his]_p19067 immediate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise.",1,,30,
stoker_dracula," There is also the instruction to [Petrof Skinsky]_n2286. These [we]_p19068 must only guess at but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim. That, so far, [his]_p19069 plans were successful [we]_p19070 know. The Czarina Catherine made a phenomenally quick journey, so much so that Captain Donelson's suspicions were aroused but [his]_p19071 superstition united with [his]_p19072 canniness played the Count's game for him, and [he]_p19074 ran with [his]_p19072 favouring wind through fogs and all till [he]_p19075 brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved. [Hildesheim]_n2287 cleared the box, took [it]_p19076 off, and gave [it]_p19077 to Skinsky. [Skinsky]_n2288 took it, and here [we]_p19078 lose the trail. [We]_p19079 only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided. Now [we]_p19080 come to what the Count must have done after [his]_p19081 arrival, on land, at Galatz.",3,,14,
stoker_dracula," The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could appear in [his]_p19082 own form. Here, [we]_p19083 ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work? In [my]_p19084 husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port and the man's remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling against [his]_p19085 class. The Count wanted isolation. [My]_p19086 surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to [his]_p19087 castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. [He]_p19088 was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably [they]_p19089 delivered [their]_p19091 cargo to [Slovaks]_n2289 who took the boxes to Varna, for there [they]_p19090 were shipped for London. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, [he]_p19092 came out from [his]_p19093 box, met Skinsky and instructed [him]_p19094 what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and [he]_p19095 knew that all was in train, [he]_p19096 blotted out [his]_p19098 traces, as [he]_p19096 thought, by murdering [his]_p19099 agent. [I]_p19100 have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth.",1,,19,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p19101 read in the typescript that in [my]_p19103 trance [I]_p19102 heard cows low and water swirling level with [my]_p19104 ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in [his]_p19105 box, then, was on a river in an open boat, propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and [it]_p19106 is working against stream. There would be no such sound if floating down stream. Of course [it]_p19107 may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but [we]_p19108 may possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the [Borgo Pass]_n2290. The loop [it]_p19109 makes is manifestly as close to [Dracula]_n's2291 castle as can be got by water. Mina Harker's [Journal]_n,2292 continued. When [I]_p19110 had done reading, Jonathan took [me]_p19111 in [his]_p19113 arms and kissed me. The others kept shaking [me]_p19114 by both hands, and Dr [Van Helsing]_n2293 said:, ""Our [dear Madam Mina]_n2294 is once more [our]_p19115 teacher. [Her]_p19116 eyes have been where [we]_p19117 were blinded.",5,,16,
stoker_dracula," Now [we]_p19118 are on the track once again, and this time [we]_p19119 may succeed. [Our]_p19120 enemy is at [his]_p19121 most helpless and if [we]_p19122 can come on [him]_p19123 by day, on the water, [our]_p19124 task will be over. [He]_p19125 has a start, but [he]_p19126 is powerless to hasten, as [he]_p19127 may not leave [his]_p19129 box lest those who carry [him]_p19130 may suspect for [them]_p19132 to suspect would be to prompt [them]_p19133 to throw [him]_p19131 in the stream where [he]_p19127 perish. This [he]_p19134 knows, and will not. Now men, to [our]_p19135 Council of War for, here and now, [we]_p19136 must plan what each and all shall do. "" ""I shall get a steam launch and follow him,"" said [Lord Godalming]_n2295. ""And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance [he]_p19137 land,"" said [Mr Morris]_n2296. ""Good!"" said the [Professor]_n,2297 ""both good. But neither must go alone. There must be force to overcome force if need be the Slovak is strong and rough, and [he]_p19138 carries rude arms.",3,,21,
stoker_dracula," "" All the men smiled, for amongst [them]_p19139 [they]_p19140 carried a small arsenal. [Said Mr Morris]_n:,2298 ""I have brought some Winchesters [they]_p19141 are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves. The Count, if [you]_p19142 remember, took some other precautions [he]_p19143 made some requisitions on others that Mrs Harker could not quite hear or understand. [We]_p19144 must be ready at all points. "" [Dr Seward]_n2299 said:, ""I think [I]_p19145 had better go with [Quincey]_n2300. [We]_p19147 have been accustomed to hunt together, and [we]_p19148 two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come along. [You]_p19149 must not be alone, [Art]_n2301. [It]_p19150 may be necessary to fight the [Slovaks]_n,2302 and a chance thrust, for [I]_p19151 don't suppose these fellows carry guns, would undo all [our]_p19152 plans. There must be no chances, this time [we]_p19153 shall, not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and [we]_p19154 are sure that [he]_p19155 cannot re-incarnate. "" [He]_p19156 looked at [Jonathan]_n2303 as [he]_p19157 spoke, and [Jonathan]_n2304 looked at me.",7,,18,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p19158 could see that the poor [dear]_n2305 was torn about in [his]_p19159 mind. Of course [he]_p19160 wanted to be with [me]_p19161 but then the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the. the. the. [Vampire]_n2306. (Why did [I]_p19162 hesitate to write the word?) [He]_p19163 was silent awhile, and during [his]_p19164 silence Dr [Van Helsing]_n2307 spoke:, ""Friend Jonathan, this is to [you]_p19165 for twice reasons. First, because [you]_p19166 are [young]_n2308 and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the last and again that [it]_p19168 is [your]_p19169 right to destroy him, that, which has wrought such woe to [you]_p19167 and yours. Be not afraid for [Madam Mina]_n2309 [she]_p19170 will be [my]_p19171 care, if [I]_p19172 may. [I]_p19173 am old. [My]_p19174 legs are not so quick to run as once and [I]_p19175 am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons.",5,,18,
stoker_dracula," But [I]_p19176 can be of other service [I]_p19177 can fight in other way. And [I]_p19178 can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let [me]_p19179 say that what [I]_p19180 would is this: while you, [my]_p19182 [Lord]_n2310 [Godalming]_n2311 and friend Jonathan go in [your]_p19183 so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and [Quincey]_n2312 guard the bank where perchance [he]_p19184 might be landed, [I]_p19181 will take [Madam]_n2313 Mina right into the heart of the enemy's country. Whilst the old fox is tied in [his]_p19185 box, floating on the running stream whence [he]_p19188 cannot escape to land, where [he]_p19189 dares not raise the lid of [his]_p19186 coffin-box lest [his]_p19186 Slovak carriers should in fear leave [him]_p19190 to perish, [we]_p19191 shall go in the track where Jonathan went,, from [Bistritz]_n2314 over the [Borgo]_n,2315 and find [our]_p19192 way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, [Madam]_n2316 Mina's hypnotic power will surely help, and [we]_p19193 shall find [our]_p19195 way, all dark and unknown otherwise, after the first sunrise when [we]_p19194 are near that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated. "" Here Jonathan interrupted [him]_p19196 hotly:, ""Do [you]_p19197 mean to say, [Professor]_n2317 [Van Helsing]_n,2318 that [you]_p19198 would bring Mina, in [her]_p19202 sad case and tainted as [she]_p19203 is with that devil's illness, right into the jaws of [his]_p19204 death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or Hell!"" [He]_p19207 became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:, ""Do [you]_p19198 know what the place is? Have [you]_p19199 seen that awful den of hellish infamy, with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo? Have [you]_p19199 felt the Vampire's lips upon [your]_p19208 throat?"" Here [he]_p19209 turned to me, and as [his]_p19205 eyes lit on [my]_p19212 forehead [he]_p19210 threw up [his]_p19205 arms with a cry: ""Oh, [my]_p19213 God, what have [we]_p19214 done to have this terror upon us!"" and [he]_p19210 sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The [Professor]_n's2319 voice, as [he]_p19215 spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed [us]_p19216 all:, ""Oh, [my]_p19217 friend, [it]_p19218 is because [I]_p19219 would save [Madam]_n2320 Mina from that awful place that [I]_p19220 would go. God forbid that [I]_p19221 should take [her]_p19222 into that place. There is work, wild work, to be done there, that [her]_p19223 eyes may not see.",11,,48,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p19224 men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with [their]_p19225 own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that [we]_p19226 are in terrible straits. If the Count escape [us]_p19227 this time, and [he]_p19228 is strong and subtle and cunning, [he]_p19229 may choose to sleep [him]_p19231 for a century, and then in time [our]_p19234 [dear]_n2321 one"", [he]_p19229 took [my]_p19235 hand, ""would come to [him]_p19232 to keep [him]_p19232 company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. [You]_p19236 have told [us]_p19237 of [their]_p19238 gloating lips [you]_p19240 heard [their]_p19239 ribald laugh as [they]_p19241 clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. [You]_p19242 shudder and well may [it]_p19243 be. Forgive [me]_p19244 that [I]_p19245 make [you]_p19246 so much pain, but [it]_p19247 is necessary. [My]_p19248 friend, is [it]_p19249 not a dire need for the which [I]_p19252 am giving, possibly [my]_p19254 life? If [it]_p19250 were that any one went into that place to stay, [it]_p19250 is [I]_p19253 who would have to go to keep [them]_p19255 company. ""  ""Do as [you]_p19256 will,"" said Jonathan, with a sob that shook [him]_p19257 all over, ""we are in the hands of God!""  * * * * *  Later. , Oh, [it]_p19258 did [me]_p19259 good to see the way that these brave men worked. How can women help loving men when [they]_p19260 are so earnest, and so true, and so brave! And, too, [it]_p19261 made [me]_p19265 think of the wonderful power of money! What can [it]_p19262 not do when [it]_p19262 is properly applied and what might [it]_p19263 do when basely used.",1,,42,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p19266 felt so thankful that [Lord]_n2322 [Godalming]_n2323 is rich, and that both [he]_p19267 and Mr Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend [it]_p19268 so freely. For if [they]_p19269 did not, [our]_p19270 little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as [it]_p19271 will within another hour. [It]_p19272 is not three hours since [it]_p19273 was arranged what part each of [us]_p19274 was to do and now [Lord]_n2324 [Godalming]_n2325 and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice. Dr [Seward]_n2326 and Mr Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. [We]_p19275 have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. [Professor]_n2327 [Van Helsing]_n2328 and [I]_p19276 are to leave by the 11:40 train [to-night]_n2329 for Veresti, where [we]_p19277 are to get a carriage to drive to the [Borgo Pass]_n2330. [We]_p19278 are bringing a good deal of ready money, as [we]_p19279 are to buy a carriage and horses. [We]_p19280 shall drive ourselves, for [we]_p19281 have no one whom [we]_p19282 can trust in the matter. The [Professor]_n2331 knows something of a great many languages, so [we]_p19283 shall get on all right. [We]_p19284 have all got arms, even for [me]_p19285 a large-bore revolver Jonathan would not be happy unless [I]_p19286 was armed like the rest.",10,,21,
stoker_dracula," Alas! [I]_p19287 cannot carry one arm that the [rest]_n2332 do the scar on [my]_p19288 forehead forbids that. [Dear Dr Van Helsing]_n2333 comforts [me]_p19289 by telling [me]_p19290 that [I]_p19291 am fully armed as there may be wolves the weather is getting colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as warnings. * * * * *  Later. , [It]_p19292 took all [my]_p19293 courage to say good-bye to [my]_p19294 darling. [We]_p19295 may never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at [you]_p19296 keenly  [his]_p19297 look is a warning. There must be no tears now, unless [it]_p19298 may be that God will let [them]_p19299 fall in gladness. Jonathan Harker's [Journal]_n2334. October 30. Night.",3,,13,
stoker_dracula," , [I]_p19300 am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch: [Lord Godalming]_n2335 is firing up. [He]_p19301 is an experienced hand at the work, as [he]_p19302 has had for years a launch of [his]_p19303 own on the Thames, and another on the [Norfolk Broads]_n2336. Regarding [our]_p19304 plans, [we]_p19305 finally decided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count's escape back to [his]_p19306 Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza at [its]_p19307 junction, would be the one. [We]_p19308 took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians. [We]_p19309 have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. [Lord]_n2337 [Godalming]_n2338 tells [me]_p19310 to sleep for a while, as [it]_p19311 is enough for the present for one to be on watch. But [I]_p19312 cannot sleep, how can [I]_p19313 with the terrible danger hanging over [my]_p19314 darling, and [her]_p19315 going out into that awful place. [My]_p19316 only comfort is that [we]_p19317 are in the hands of God. Only for that faith [it]_p19318 would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr Morris and Dr [Seward]_n2339 were off on [their]_p19319 long ride before [we]_p19320 started [they]_p19321 are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where [they]_p19322 can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of [its]_p19323 curves.",5,,24,
stoker_dracula," [They]_p19324 have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead [their]_p19325 spare horses, four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When [they]_p19326 dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, [they]_p19327 shall [themselves]_p19328 look after the horses. [It]_p19329 may be necessary for [us]_p19330 to join forces if so [they]_p19331 can mount [our]_p19332 whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and can be easily adapted for [Mina]_n,2340 if required. [It]_p19333 is a wild adventure [we]_p19334 are on. Here, as [we]_p19335 are rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike [us]_p19336 with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, [it]_p19338 all comes home. [We]_p19339 seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways into a whole world of dark and dreadful things. [Godalming]_n2341 is shutting the furnace door. * * * * *  31 October. , Still hurrying along.",2,,15,
stoker_dracula," The day has come, and [Godalming]_n2342 is sleeping. [I]_p19340 am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold the furnace heat is grateful, though [we]_p19341 have heavy fur coats. As yet [we]_p19342 have passed only a few open boats, but none of [them]_p19344 had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one [we]_p19343 seek. The men were scared every time [we]_p19345 turned [our]_p19346 electric lamp on them, and fell on [their]_p19347 knees and prayed. * * * * *  1 November, evening. , No news all day [we]_p19348 have found nothing of the kind [we]_p19349 seek. [We]_p19350 have now passed into the Bistritza and if [we]_p19351 are wrong in [our]_p19352 surmise [our]_p19353 chance is gone. [We]_p19354 have over-hauled every boat, big and little. Early this morning, one crew took [us]_p19355 for a Government boat, and treated [us]_p19356 accordingly.",1,,17,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p19357 saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, [we]_p19358 got a Roumanian flag which [we]_p19359 now fly conspicuously. With every boat which [we]_p19360 have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded [we]_p19361 have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever [we]_p19361 chose to ask or do. Some of the [Slovaks]_n2343 tell [us]_p19363 that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as [she]_p19364 had a double crew on board. This was before [they]_p19365 came to Fundu, so [they]_p19366 could not tell [us]_p19367 whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu [we]_p19368 could not hear of any such boat, so [she]_p19369 must have passed there in the night. [I]_p19370 am feeling very sleepy the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature must have [rest]_n2344 some time. [Godalming]_n2345 insists that [he]_p19371 shall keep the first watch. God bless [him]_p19372 for all [his]_p19373 goodness to poor [dear]_n2346 Mina and me. * * * * *  2 November, morning. , [It]_p19374 is broad daylight.",4,,18,
stoker_dracula," That good fellow would not wake me. [He]_p19375 says [it]_p19376 would have been a sin to, for [I]_p19377 slept peacefully and was forgetting [my]_p19378 trouble. [It]_p19379 seems brutally selfish to [me]_p19380 to have slept so long, and let [him]_p19381 watch all night but [he]_p19382 was quite right. [I]_p19383 am a new man this morning and, as [I]_p19384 sit here and watch [him]_p19386 sleeping, [I]_p19384 can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch. [I]_p19387 can feel that [my]_p19388 strength and energy are coming back to me. [I]_p19389 wonder where Mina is now, and [Van Helsing]_n2347. [They]_p19390 should have got to [Veresti]_n2348 about noon on [Wednesday]_n2349. [It]_p19391 would take [them]_p19392 some time to get the carriage and horses so if [they]_p19393 had started and travelled hard, [they]_p19394 would be about now at the [Borgo Pass]_n2350. God guide and help them! [I]_p19395 am afraid to think what may happen. If [we]_p19396 could only go faster! but [we]_p19397 cannot the engines are throbbing and doing [their]_p19398 utmost.",4,,24,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p19399 wonder how Dr [Seward]_n2351 and [Mr Morris]_n2352 are getting on. There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of [them]_p19400 are very large, at present, at all events, though [they]_p19401 are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melts, the horsemen may not have met much obstruction. [I]_p19402 hope that before [we]_p19403 get to Strasba [we]_p19404 may see [them]_p19406 for if by that time [we]_p19404 have not overtaken the Count, [it]_p19407 may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next. [Dr Seward]_n's2353 [Diary]_n2354. 2 November. , Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write [it]_p19408 if there had been, for every moment is precious. [We]_p19409 have had only the rest needful for the horses but [we]_p19410 are both bearing [it]_p19411 wonderfully. Those adventurous days of [ours]_p19412 are turning up useful. [We]_p19413 must push on  [we]_p19414 shall never feel happy till [we]_p19415 get the launch in sight again.",4,,17,
stoker_dracula," * * * * *  3 November. , [We]_p19416 heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the Bistritza. [I]_p19417 wish [it]_p19418 wasn't so cold. There are signs of snow coming and if [it]_p19419 falls heavy [it]_p19420 will stop us. In such case [we]_p19421 must get a sledge and go on, Russian fashion. * * * * *  4 November. , To-day [we]_p19422 heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up only a few hours before. [Godalming]_n2355 is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently [it]_p19423 was [he]_p19424 who put the launch in trim again.",1,,9,
stoker_dracula," Finally, [they]_p19425 got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase afresh. [I]_p19426 fear that the boat is not any better for the accident the peasantry tell [us]_p19427 that after [she]_p19428 got upon smooth water again, [she]_p19429 kept stopping every now and again so long as [she]_p19429 was in sight. [We]_p19431 must push on harder than ever [our]_p19432 help may be wanted soon. Mina Harker's [Journal]_n2356. 31 October. , Arrived at [Veresti]_n2357 at noon. The [Professor]_n2358 tells [me]_p19433 that this morning at dawn [he]_p19435 could hardly hypnotise [me]_p19434 at all, and that all [I]_p19436 could say was: ""dark and quiet. "" [He]_p19437 is off now buying a carriage and horses. [He]_p19438 says that [he]_p19439 will later on try to buy additional horses, so that [we]_p19440 may be able to change [them]_p19441 on the way. [We]_p19442 have something more than 70 miles before us.",3,,18,
stoker_dracula," The country is lovely, and most interesting if only [we]_p19443 were under different conditions, how delightful [it]_p19444 would be to see [it]_p19445 all. If [Jonathan]_n2359 and [I]_p19446 were driving through [it]_p19447 alone what a pleasure [it]_p19448 would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of [their]_p19449 life, and to fill [our]_p19450 minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint people! But, alas!,   * * * * *  Later. , [Dr Van Helsing]_n2360 has returned. [He]_p19451 has got the carriage and horses [we]_p19452 are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The landlady is putting [us]_p19453 up a huge basket of provisions [it]_p19454 seems enough for a company of soldiers. The [Professor]_n2361 encourages her, and whispers to [me]_p19455 that [it]_p19456 may be a week before [we]_p19457 can get any good food again. [He]_p19458 has been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of [our]_p19459 being cold. * * * * *  [We]_p19460 shall soon be off.",3,,18,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p19461 am afraid to think what may happen to us. [We]_p19462 are truly in the hands of God. [He]_p19463 alone knows what may be, and [I]_p19465 pray [Him]_n,2362 with all the strength of [my]_p19468 sad and humble soul, that [He]_p19464 will watch over [my]_p19469 beloved husband that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that [I]_p19466 loved [him]_p19471 and honoured [him]_p19472 more than [I]_p19466 can say, and that [my]_p19469 latest and truest thought will be always for him. CHAPTER [XXVII]_n2363 [MINA HARKER]_n'S2364 JOURNAL 1 November. , All day long [we]_p19474 have travelled, and at a good speed. The horses seem to know that [they]_p19475 are being kindly treated, for [they]_p19476 go willingly [their]_p19477 full stage at best speed. [We]_p19478 have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that [we]_p19479 are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one. [Dr Van Helsing]_n2365 is laconic [he]_p19480 tells the farmers that [he]_p19481 is hurrying to [Bistritz]_n,2366 and pays [them]_p19482 well to make the exchange of horses. [We]_p19483 get hot soup, or coffee, or tea and off [we]_p19484 go. [It]_p19485 is a lovely country full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities.",5,,24,
stoker_dracula," [They]_p19486 are very, very superstitious. In the first house where [we]_p19487 stopped, when the woman who served [us]_p19488 saw the scar on [my]_p19489 forehead, [she]_p19490 crossed [herself]_p19491 and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye. [I]_p19492 believe [they]_p19494 went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into [our]_p19495 food and [I]_p19493 can't abide garlic. Ever since then [I]_p19496 have taken care not to take off [my]_p19497 hat or veil, and so have escaped [their]_p19498 suspicions. [We]_p19499 are travelling fast, and as [we]_p19500 have no driver with [us]_p19502 to carry tales, [we]_p19501 go ahead of scandal but [I]_p19504 daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind [us]_p19503 all the way. The [Professor]_n2367 seems tireless all day [he]_p19505 would not take any rest, though [he]_p19506 made [me]_p19507 sleep for a long spell. At sunset time [he]_p19508 hypnotised me, and [he]_p19509 says that [I]_p19510 answered as usual ""darkness, lapping water and creaking wood"" so [our]_p19511 enemy is still on the river. [I]_p19512 am afraid to think of [Jonathan]_n,2368 but somehow [I]_p19513 have now no fear for him, or for myself. [I]_p19514 write this whilst [we]_p19515 wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr [Van Helsing]_n2369 is sleeping, [Poor]_n2370 [dear]_n,2371 [he]_p19516 looks very tired and old and grey, but [his]_p19518 mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's even in [his]_p19519 sleep [he]_p19517 is instinct with resolution.",5,,34,
stoker_dracula," When [we]_p19520 have well started [I]_p19521 must make [him]_p19523 rest whilst [I]_p19522 drive. [I]_p19524 shall tell [him]_p19525 that [we]_p19526 have days before us, and [we]_p19527 must not break down when most of all [his]_p19528 strength will be needed. All is ready [we]_p19529 are off shortly. * * * * *  2 November, morning. , [I]_p19530 was successful, and [we]_p19531 took turns driving all night now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange heaviness in the air, [I]_p19532 say heaviness for want of a better word [I]_p19533 mean that [it]_p19534 oppresses [us]_p19535 both. [It]_p19536 is very cold, and only [our]_p19537 warm furs keep [us]_p19538 comfortable. At dawn [Van Helsing]_n2372 hypnotised [me]_p19539 [he]_p19540 says [I]_p19541 answered ""darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,"" so the river is changing as [they]_p19542 ascend. [I]_p19543 do hope that [my]_p19544 darling will not run any chance of danger, more than need be but [we]_p19545 are in God's hands. * * * * *  2 November, night.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," , All day long driving. The country gets wilder as [we]_p19546 go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed so far from [us]_p19547 and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round [us]_p19548 and tower in front. [We]_p19549 both seem in good spirits [I]_p19550 think [we]_p19551 make an effort each to cheer the other in the doing so [we]_p19552 cheer ourselves. [Dr Van Helsing]_n2373 says that by morning [we]_p19553 shall reach the [Borgo Pass]_n2374. The houses are very few here now, and the [Professor]_n2375 says that the last horse [we]_p19554 got will have to go on with us, as [we]_p19555 may not be able to change. [He]_p19556 got two in addition to the two [we]_p19557 changed, so that now [we]_p19558 have a rude four-in-hand. The [dear]_n2376 horses are patient and good, and [they]_p19559 give [us]_p19560 no trouble. [We]_p19561 are not worried with other travellers, and so even [I]_p19562 can drive. [We]_p19563 shall get to the [Pass]_n2377 in daylight [we]_p19564 do not want to arrive before. So [we]_p19565 take [it]_p19566 easy, and have each a long [rest]_n2378 in turn.",6,,21,
stoker_dracula," Oh, what will to-morrow bring to us? [We]_p19567 go to seek the place where [my]_p19568 poor darling suffered so much. God grant that [we]_p19569 may be guided aright, and that [He]_p19570 will deign to watch over [my]_p19571 husband and those [dear]_n2379 to [us]_p19572 both, and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, [I]_p19573 am not worthy in [His]_p19574 sight. Alas! [I]_p19575 am unclean to [His]_p19576 eyes, and shall be until [He]_p19579 may deign to let [me]_p19580 stand forth in [His]_p19577 sight as one of those who have not incurred [His]_p19577 wrath. Memorandum by [Abraham Van Helsing]_n2380. 4 November. , This to [my]_p19581 old and true friend John [Seward]_n,2381 M. D. , of Purfleet, [London]_n,2382 in case [I]_p19582 may not see him. [It]_p19583 may explain.",4,,17,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p19584 is morning, and [I]_p19585 write by a fire which all the night [I]_p19586 have kept alive, [Madam Mina]_n2383 aiding me. [It]_p19587 is cold, cold so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow, which when [it]_p19588 falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. [It]_p19590 seems to have affected [Madam]_n2384 Mina [she]_p19591 has been so heavy of head all day that [she]_p19592 was not like herself. [She]_p19593 sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! [She]_p19594 who is usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day [she]_p19595 even have lost [her]_p19596 appetite. [She]_p19597 make no entry into [her]_p19598 little diary, [she]_p19599 who write so faithful at every pause. Something whisper to [me]_p19600 that all is not well. However, [to-night]_n2385 [she]_p19601 is more vif. [Her]_p19602 long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for now [she]_p19603 is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset [I]_p19604 try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect the power has grown less and less with each day, and [to-night]_n2386 [it]_p19605 fail [me]_p19606 altogether. Well, God's will be done, whatever [it]_p19607 may be, and whithersoever [it]_p19608 may lead! Now to the historical, for as [Madam]_n2387 Mina write not in [her]_p19609 stenography, [I]_p19610 must, in [my]_p19611 cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of [us]_p19612 may not go unrecorded.",5,,28,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p19613 got to the [Borgo Pass]_n2388 just after sunrise yesterday morning. When [I]_p19614 saw the signs of the dawn [I]_p19615 got ready for the hypnotism. [We]_p19616 stopped [our]_p19617 carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. [I]_p19618 made a couch with furs, and [Madam Mina]_n,2389 lying down, yield [herself]_p19619 as usual, but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As before, came the answer: ""darkness and the swirling of water. "" Then [she]_p19620 woke, bright and radiant and [we]_p19621 go on [our]_p19622 way and soon reach the Pass. At this time and place, [she]_p19623 become all on fire with zeal some new guiding power be in [her]_p19625 manifested, for [she]_p19624 point to a road and say:,   ""This is the way. ""  ""How know [you]_p19626 it?"" [I]_p19627 ask. ""Of course [I]_p19628 know it,"" [she]_p19633 answer, and with a pause, add: ""Have not [my]_p19634 Jonathan travelled [it]_p19631 and wrote of [his]_p19635 travel?""  At first [I]_p19629 think somewhat strange, but soon [I]_p19629 see that there be only one such by-road. [It]_p19636 is used but little, and very different from the coach road from the [Bukovina]_n2390 to [Bistritz]_n,2391 which is more wide and hard, and more of use.",4,,23,
stoker_dracula," So [we]_p19637 came down this road when [we]_p19638 meet other ways, not always were [we]_p19638 sure that [they]_p19640 were roads at all, for [they]_p19641 be neglect and light snow have fallen, the horses know and [they]_p19641 only. [I]_p19643 give rein to them, and [they]_p19644 go on so patient. By-and-by [we]_p19645 find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then [we]_p19646 go on for long, long hours and hours. At the first, [I]_p19647 tell [Madam Mina]_n2392 to sleep [she]_p19648 try, and [she]_p19649 succeed. [She]_p19650 sleep all the time till at the last, [I]_p19651 feel [myself]_p19652 to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But [she]_p19653 sleep on, and [I]_p19654 may not wake [her]_p19656 though [I]_p19655 try. [I]_p19657 do not wish to try too hard lest [I]_p19658 harm [her]_p19660 for [I]_p19658 know that [she]_p19662 have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her. [I]_p19663 think [I]_p19664 drowse myself, for all of sudden [I]_p19664 feel guilt, as though [I]_p19665 have done something [I]_p19665 find [myself]_p19668 bolt up, with the reins in [my]_p19670 hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. [I]_p19671 look down and find [Madam Mina]_n2393 still sleep.",2,,33,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p19672 is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that [we]_p19673 throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep. For [we]_p19674 are going up, and up and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though [it]_p19675 were the end of the world. Then [I]_p19676 arouse [Madam]_n2394 Mina. This time [she]_p19677 wake with not much trouble, and then [I]_p19678 try to put [her]_p19679 to hypnotic sleep. But [she]_p19680 sleep not, being as though [I]_p19681 were not. Still [I]_p19682 try and try, till all at once [I]_p19683 find [her]_p19685 and [myself]_p19686 in dark so [I]_p19683 look round, and find that the sun have gone down. [Madam Mina]_n2395 laugh, and [I]_p19687 turn and look at her. [She]_p19688 is now quite awake, and look so well as [I]_p19689 never saw [her]_p19690 since that night at Carfax when [we]_p19691 first enter the Count's house. [I]_p19692 am amaze, and not at ease then but [she]_p19694 is so bright and tender and thoughtful for [me]_p19695 that [I]_p19693 forget all fear. [I]_p19696 light a fire, for [we]_p19698 have brought supply of wood with us, and [she]_p19699 prepare food while [I]_p19697 undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter, to feed.",2,,28,
stoker_dracula," Then when [I]_p19700 return to the fire [she]_p19701 have [my]_p19702 supper ready. [I]_p19703 go to help [her]_p19704 but [she]_p19705 smile, and tell [me]_p19709 that [she]_p19706 have eat already, that [she]_p19706 was so hungry that [she]_p19707 would not wait. [I]_p19710 like [it]_p19714 not, and [I]_p19711 have grave doubts but [I]_p19711 fear to affright her, and so [I]_p19712 am silent of it. [She]_p19716 help [me]_p19717 and [I]_p19718 eat alone and then [we]_p19721 wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and [I]_p19719 tell [her]_p19722 to sleep while [I]_p19719 watch. But presently [I]_p19723 forget all of watching and when [I]_p19724 sudden remember that [I]_p19724 watch, [I]_p19725 find [her]_p19727 lying quiet, but awake, and looking at [me]_p19728 with so bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and [I]_p19729 get much sleep till before morning. When [I]_p19730 wake [I]_p19731 try to hypnotise [her]_p19732 but alas! though [she]_p19734 shut [her]_p19733 eyes obedient, [she]_p19735 may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up and then sleep come to [her]_p19736 too late, but so heavy that [she]_p19737 will not wake. [I]_p19738 have to lift [her]_p19740 up, and place [her]_p19741 sleeping in the carriage when [I]_p19739 have harnessed the horses and made all ready. [Madam]_n2396 still sleep, and [she]_p19742 look in [her]_p19743 sleep more healthy and more redder than before.",1,,43,
stoker_dracula," And [I]_p19744 like [it]_p19745 not. And [I]_p19746 am afraid, afraid, afraid!, [I]_p19747 am afraid of all things, even to think but [I]_p19747 must go on [my]_p19749 way. The stake [we]_p19750 play for is life and death, or more than these, and [we]_p19751 must not flinch. * * * * *  5 November, morning. , Let [me]_p19752 be accurate in everything, for though [you]_p19753 and [I]_p19755 have seen some strange things together, [you]_p19754 may at the first think that I, [Van Helsing]_n,2397 am mad, that the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn [my]_p19757 brain. All yesterday [we]_p19758 travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water, and [Nature]_n2398 seem to have held sometime [her]_p19759 carnival. [Madam]_n2399 Mina still sleep and sleep and though [I]_p19760 did have hunger and appeased it, [I]_p19761 could not waken her, even for food. [I]_p19762 began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as [she]_p19763 is with that [Vampire]_n2400 baptism. ""Well,"" said [I]_p19764 to myself, ""if [it]_p19766 be that [she]_p19768 sleep all the day, [it]_p19767 shall also be that [I]_p19765 do not sleep at night.",4,,24,
stoker_dracula," "" As [we]_p19769 travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, [I]_p19770 held down [my]_p19771 head and slept. Again [I]_p19772 waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found [Madam]_n2401 Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed the frowning mountains seemed further away, and [we]_p19773 were near the top of a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in [his]_p19774 diary. At once [I]_p19775 exulted and feared for now, for good or ill, the end was near. [I]_p19776 woke [Madam Mina]_n,2402 and again tried to hypnotise [her]_p19777 but alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us, for even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight, [I]_p19778 took out the horses and fed [them]_p19780 in what shelter [I]_p19779 could. Then [I]_p19781 make a fire and near [it]_p19783 [I]_p19782 make [Madam]_n2403 Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid [her]_p19784 rugs. [I]_p19785 got ready food: but [she]_p19786 would not eat, simply saying that [she]_p19787 had not hunger. [I]_p19788 did not press her, knowing [her]_p19789 unavailingness. But [I]_p19791 [myself]_p19793 eat, for [I]_p19792 must needs now be strong for all.",3,,24,
stoker_dracula," Then, with the fear on [me]_p19794 of what might be, [I]_p19795 drew a ring so big for [her]_p19798 comfort, round where [Madam]_n2404 Mina sat and over the ring [I]_p19796 passed some of the wafer, and [I]_p19796 broke [it]_p19799 fine so that all was well guarded. [She]_p19800 sat still all the time, so still as one dead and [she]_p19801 grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale and no word [she]_p19802 said. But when [I]_p19803 drew near, [she]_p19805 clung to me, and [I]_p19804 could know that the poor soul shook [her]_p19806 from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. [I]_p19807 said to [her]_p19809 presently, when [she]_p19810 had grown more quiet:,   ""Will [you]_p19812 not come over to the fire?"" for [I]_p19808 wished to make a test of what [she]_p19811 could. [She]_p19813 rose obedient, but when [she]_p19814 have made a step [she]_p19815 stopped, and stood as one stricken. ""Why not go on?"" [I]_p19816 asked. [She]_p19817 shook [her]_p19818 head, and, coming back, sat down in [her]_p19819 place. Then, looking at [me]_p19820 with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, [she]_p19821 said simply:,   ""I cannot!"" and remained silent. [I]_p19822 rejoiced, for [I]_p19823 knew that what [she]_p19824 could not, none of those that [we]_p19825 dreaded could. Though there might be danger to [her]_p19826 body, yet [her]_p19827 soul was safe!  Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at [their]_p19828 tethers till [I]_p19829 came to [them]_p19830 and quieted them.",1,,37,
stoker_dracula," When [they]_p19832 did feel [my]_p19834 hands on them, [they]_p19833 whinnied low as in joy, and licked at [my]_p19835 hands and were quiet for a time. Many times through the night did [I]_p19836 come to them, till [it]_p19837 arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest and every time [my]_p19838 coming was with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and [I]_p19839 was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with [it]_p19840 a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow and [it]_p19842 seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. [I]_p19843 began to fear, horrible fears but then came to [me]_p19845 the sense of safety in that ring wherein [I]_p19844 stood. [I]_p19846 began, too, to think that [my]_p19848 imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that [I]_p19847 have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety. [It]_p19849 was as though [my]_p19850 memories of all Jonathan's horrid experience were befooling [me]_p19851 for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till [I]_p19852 could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that [they]_p19853 could break away.",0,,21,
stoker_dracula," [I]_p19854 feared for [my]_p19855 [dear Madam Mina]_n2405 when these weird figures drew near and circled round. [I]_p19856 looked at her, but [she]_p19858 sat calm, and smiled at [me]_p19860 when [I]_p19857 would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, [she]_p19859 caught [me]_p19861 and held [me]_p19861 back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low [it]_p19863 was:,   ""No! No! Do not go without. Here [you]_p19865 are safe!"" [I]_p19868 turned to her, and looking in [her]_p19873 eyes, said:,   ""But you? [It]_p19877 is for [you]_p19866 that [I]_p19869 fear!"" whereat [she]_p19878 laughed, a laugh, low and unreal, and said:,   ""Fear for me! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from [them]_p19879 than [I]_p19869 am,"" and as [I]_p19870 wondered at the meaning of [her]_p19874 words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and [I]_p19870 see the red scar on [her]_p19874 forehead. Then, alas! [I]_p19880 knew. Did [I]_p19881 not, [I]_p19882 would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the [Holy]_n2406 circle. Then [they]_p19883 began to materialise till, if God have not take away [my]_p19885 reason, for [I]_p19887 saw [it]_p19888 through [my]_p19886 eyes, there were before [me]_p19889 in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when [they]_p19884 would have kissed [his]_p19890 throat. [I]_p19891 knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips. [They]_p19892 smiled ever at poor [dear]_n2407 Madam Mina and as [their]_p19893 laugh came through the silence of the night, [they]_p19895 twined [their]_p19894 arms and pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:, ""Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!"" In fear [I]_p19896 turned to [my]_p19897 poor Madam Mina, and [my]_p19898 heart with gladness leapt like flame for oh! the terror in [her]_p19900 sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to [my]_p19898 heart that was all of hope.",3,,44,
stoker_dracula," God be thanked [she]_p19901 was not, yet, of them. [I]_p19902 seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the [Wafer]_n,2408 advanced on [them]_p19903 towards the fire. [They]_p19904 drew back before me, and laughed [their]_p19905 low horrid laugh. [I]_p19906 fed the fire, and feared [them]_p19908 not for [I]_p19907 knew that [we]_p19909 were safe within [our]_p19910 protections. [They]_p19911 could not approach, me, whilst so armed, nor [Madam]_n2409 Mina whilst [she]_p19912 remained within the ring, which [she]_p19913 could not leave no more than [they]_p19914 could enter. The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground the snow fell on [them]_p19915 softly, and [they]_p19916 grew whiter. [I]_p19917 knew that there was for the [poor]_n2410 beasts no more of terror. And so [we]_p19918 remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snow-gloom. [I]_p19919 was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to [me]_p19920 again. At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle, and were lost.",3,,20,
stoker_dracula," Instinctively, with the dawn coming, [I]_p19921 turned to [Madam]_n2411 Mina, intending to hypnotise [her]_p19923 but [she]_p19925 lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which [I]_p19922 could not wake her. [I]_p19926 tried to hypnotise through [her]_p19927 sleep, but [she]_p19928 made no response, none at all and the day broke. [I]_p19929 fear yet to stir. [I]_p19930 have made [my]_p19931 fire and have seen the horses, [they]_p19932 are all dead. [To-day]_n2412 [I]_p19933 have much to do here, and [I]_p19934 keep waiting till the sun is up high for there may be places where [I]_p19934 must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to [me]_p19936 a safety. [I]_p19937 will strengthen [me]_p19939 with breakfast, and then [I]_p19938 will to [my]_p19940 terrible work. [Madam Mina]_n2413 still sleeps and, God be thanked! [she]_p19941 is calm in [her]_p19942 sleep. Jonathan Harker's [Journal]_n2414. 4 November, evening. , The accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us.",4,,21,
stoker_dracula," Only for [it]_p19943 [we]_p19944 should have overtaken the boat long ago and by now [my]_p19945 [dear]_n2415 Mina would have been free. [I]_p19946 fear to think of her, off on the wolds near that horrid place. [We]_p19947 have got horses, and [we]_p19948 follow on the track. [I]_p19949 note this whilst [Godalming]_n2416 is getting ready. [We]_p19950 have [our]_p19951 arms. The Szgany must look out if [they]_p19952 mean fight. Oh, if only Morris and [Seward]_n2417 were with us. [We]_p19953 must only hope! If [I]_p19954 write no more [Good-bye]_n,2418 [Mina]_n!2419 God bless and keep you. [Dr Seward]_n's2420 [Diary]_n2421. 5 November.",7,,12,
stoker_dracula," , With the dawn [we]_p19955 saw the body of Szgany before [us]_p19956 dashing away from the river with [their]_p19957 leiter-wagon. [They]_p19958 surrounded [it]_p19959 in a cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air. [It]_p19960 may be [our]_p19961 own feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off [I]_p19962 hear the howling of wolves the snow brings [them]_p19963 down from the mountains, and there are dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready, and [we]_p19964 are soon off. [We]_p19965 ride to death of some one. God alone knows who, or where, or what, or when, or how [it]_p19966 may be. [Dr Van Helsing]_n's2422 Memorandum. 5 November, afternoon.",1,,12,
stoker_dracula," , [I]_p19967 am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy at all events, though the proving [it]_p19968 has been dreadful. When [I]_p19969 left [Madam]_n2423 Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, [I]_p19970 took [my]_p19971 way to the castle. The blacksmith hammer which [I]_p19972 took in the carriage from Veresti was useful though the doors were all open [I]_p19973 broke [them]_p19975 off the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that being entered [I]_p19973 might not get out. Jonathan's bitter experience served [me]_p19977 here. By memory of [his]_p19978 diary [I]_p19979 found [my]_p19981 way to the old chapel, for [I]_p19980 knew that here [my]_p19982 work lay. The air was oppressive [it]_p19983 seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made [me]_p19984 dizzy. Either there was a roaring in [my]_p19985 ears or [I]_p19986 heard afar off the howl of wolves. Then [I]_p19987 bethought [me]_p19989 of [my]_p19990 [dear Madam Mina]_n,2424 and [I]_p19988 was in terrible plight. The dilemma had [me]_p19991 between [his]_p19992 horns.",2,,25,
stoker_dracula," Her, [I]_p19993 had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle and yet even there would be the wolf! [I]_p19994 resolve [me]_p19995 that [my]_p19996 work lay here, and that as to the wolves [we]_p19997 must submit, if [it]_p19998 were God's will. At any rate [it]_p19999 was only death and freedom beyond. So did [I]_p20000 choose for her. Had [it]_p20001 but been for [myself]_p20002 the choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire! So [I]_p20003 make [my]_p20004 choice to go on with [my]_p20005 work. [I]_p20006 knew that there were at least three graves to find, graves that are inhabit so [I]_p20007 search, and search, and [I]_p20007 find one of them. [She]_p20009 lay in [her]_p20010 [Vampire]_n2425 sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that [I]_p20011 shudder as though [I]_p20012 have come to do murder. Ah, [I]_p20013 doubt not that in old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine, found at the last [his]_p20014 heart fail him, and then [his]_p20015 nerve. So [he]_p20016 delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton [Un-Dead]_n2426 have hypnotise [him]_p20018 and [he]_p20017 remain on and on, till sunset come, and the [Vampire]_n2427 sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss, and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the [Vampire]_n2428 fold one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the [Un-Dead]_n!2429.",5,,26,
stoker_dracula," There is some fascination, surely, when [I]_p20019 am moved by the mere presence of such an one, even lying as [she]_p20020 lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, [I]_p20021 was moved, I, [Van Helsing]_n,2430 with all [my]_p20024 purpose and with [my]_p20025 motive for hate, [I]_p20022 was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse [my]_p20025 faculties and to clog [my]_p20026 very soul. [It]_p20028 may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain [it]_p20029 was that [I]_p20031 was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that [it]_p20030 woke [me]_p20032 like the sound of a clarion. For [it]_p20033 was the voice of [my]_p20034 [dear Madam Mina]_n2431 that [I]_p20035 heard. Then [I]_p20036 braced [myself]_p20037 again to [my]_p20038 horrid task, and found by wrenching away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. [I]_p20039 dared not pause to look on [her]_p20045 as [I]_p20040 had on [her]_p20046 sister, lest once more [I]_p20040 should begin to be enthrall but [I]_p20041 go on searching until, presently, [I]_p20041 find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like Jonathan [I]_p20041 had seen to gather [herself]_p20047 out of the atoms of the mist. [She]_p20048 was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of [my]_p20049 sex to love and to protect one of hers, made [my]_p20050 head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of [my]_p20051 [dear Madam Mina]_n2432 had not died out of [my]_p20052 ears and, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, [I]_p20054 had nerved [myself]_p20055 to [my]_p20052 wild work. By this time [I]_p20056 had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as [I]_p20057 could tell and as there had been only three of these [Un-Dead]_n2433 phantoms around [us]_p20059 in the night, [I]_p20057 took [it]_p20060 that there were no more of active [Un-Dead]_n2434 existent.",5,,41,
stoker_dracula," There was one great tomb more lordly than all the [rest]_n2435 huge [it]_p20061 was, and nobly proportioned. On [it]_p20062 was but one word  DRACULA. This then was the [Un-Dead]_n2436 home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more were due. [Its]_p20063 emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what [I]_p20064 knew. Before [I]_p20065 began to restore these women to [their]_p20067 dead selves through [my]_p20068 awful work, [I]_p20066 laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished [him]_p20069 from it, [Un-Dead]_n,2437 for ever. Then began [my]_p20070 terrible task, and [I]_p20071 dreaded it. Had [it]_p20072 been but one, [it]_p20073 had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after [I]_p20074 had been through a deed of horror for if [it]_p20075 was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would [it]_p20076 not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years who would, if [they]_p20077 could, have fought for [their]_p20078 foul lives. Oh, [my]_p20079 friend John, but [it]_p20080 was butcher work had [I]_p20081 not been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, [I]_p20082 could not have gone on. [I]_p20083 tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, [my]_p20084 nerve did stand.",3,,24,
stoker_dracula," Had [I]_p20085 not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over [it]_p20087 just ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been won, [I]_p20086 could not have gone further with [my]_p20088 butchery. [I]_p20089 could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. [I]_p20090 should have fled in terror and left [my]_p20091 work undone. But [it]_p20092 is over! And the poor souls, [I]_p20093 can pity [them]_p20095 now and weep, as [I]_p20094 think of [them]_p20096 placid each in [her]_p20097 full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had [my]_p20098 knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to [its]_p20099 native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert [himself]_p20101 and say at once and loud ""I am here!""  Before [I]_p20102 left the castle [I]_p20103 so fixed [its]_p20100 entrances that never more can the Count enter there Un-Dead. When [I]_p20105 stepped into the circle where [Madam]_n2438 Mina slept, [she]_p20107 woke from [her]_p20108 sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that [I]_p20106 had endured too much. ""Come!"" [she]_p20109 said, ""come away from this awful place! Let [us]_p20110 go to meet [my]_p20112 husband who is, [I]_p20113 know, coming towards us. "" [She]_p20114 was looking thin and pale and weak but [her]_p20115 eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. [I]_p20116 was glad to see [her]_p20117 paleness and [her]_p20118 illness, for [my]_p20119 mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep. And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, [we]_p20120 go eastward to meet [our]_p20121 friends, and him, whom [Madam]_n2439 Mina tell [me]_p20122 that [she]_p20123 know are coming to meet us.",2,,37,
stoker_dracula," Mina Harker's [Journal]_n2440. 6 November. , [It]_p20124 was late in the afternoon when the [Professor]_n2441 and [I]_p20125 took [our]_p20127 way towards the east whence [I]_p20126 knew Jonathan was coming. [We]_p20128 did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for [we]_p20129 had to take heavy rugs and wraps with [us]_p20131 [we]_p20130 dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. [We]_p20132 had to take some of [our]_p20133 provisions, too, for [we]_p20134 were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as [we]_p20135 could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation. When [we]_p20136 had gone about a mile, [I]_p20137 was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest. Then [we]_p20138 looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky for [we]_p20139 were so deep under the hill whereon [it]_p20140 was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it. [We]_p20142 saw [it]_p20143 in all [its]_p20145 grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between [it]_p20144 and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. [We]_p20146 could hear the distant howling of wolves.",2,,22,
stoker_dracula," [They]_p20147 were far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror. [I]_p20148 knew from the way [Dr Van Helsing]_n2442 was searching about that [he]_p20149 was trying to seek some strategic point, where [we]_p20150 would be less exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards [we]_p20151 could trace [it]_p20152 through the drifted snow. In a little while the [Professor]_n2443 signalled to me, so [I]_p20153 got up and joined him. [He]_p20154 had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. [He]_p20155 took [me]_p20156 by the hand and drew [me]_p20157 in: ""See!"" [he]_p20158 said, ""here [you]_p20159 will be in shelter and if the wolves do come [I]_p20160 can meet [them]_p20161 one by one. "" [He]_p20162 brought in [our]_p20163 furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and forced [them]_p20164 upon me. But [I]_p20165 could not eat to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and, much as [I]_p20166 would have liked to please him, [I]_p20166 could not bring [myself]_p20168 to the attempt. [He]_p20169 looked very sad, but did not reproach me. Taking [his]_p20170 field-glasses from the case, [he]_p20171 stood on the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon.",2,,25,
stoker_dracula," Suddenly [he]_p20172 called out:, ""Look! [Madam]_n2444 Mina, look! look!"" [I]_p20174 sprang up and stood beside [him]_p20175 on the rock [he]_p20173 handed [me]_p20176 [his]_p20177 glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and [I]_p20178 could see a long way round. From the height where [we]_p20179 were [it]_p20180 was possible to see a great distance and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, [I]_p20182 could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as [it]_p20181 wound [its]_p20183 way. Straight in front of [us]_p20184 and not far off, in fact, so near that [I]_p20185 wondered [we]_p20186 had not noticed before, came a group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of [them]_p20187 was a cart, a long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as [they]_p20188 were, [I]_p20190 could see from the men's clothes that [they]_p20189 were peasants or gypsies of some kind. On the cart was a great square chest. [My]_p20191 heart leaped as [I]_p20192 saw it, for [I]_p20193 felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and well [I]_p20194 knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit.",1,,23,
stoker_dracula," In fear [I]_p20195 turned to the [Professor]_n2445 to [my]_p20196 consternation, however, [he]_p20197 was not there. An instant later, [I]_p20198 saw [him]_p20199 below me. Round the rock [he]_p20200 had drawn a circle, such as [we]_p20201 had found shelter in last night. When [he]_p20202 had completed [it]_p20204 [he]_p20203 stood beside [me]_p20205 again, saying:,   ""At least [you]_p20207 shall be safe here from him!"" [He]_p20208 took the glasses from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us. ""See,"" [he]_p20209 said, ""they come quickly [they]_p20210 are flogging the horses, and galloping as hard as [they]_p20211 can. "" [He]_p20213 paused and went on in a hollow voice:,   ""They are racing for the sunset. [We]_p20214 may be too late. God's will be done!"" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out. [It]_p20215 soon passed, however, and once more [his]_p20216 glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:,   ""Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south.",1,,20,
stoker_dracula," [It]_p20217 must be [Quincey]_n2446 and [John]_n2447. Take the glass. Look before the snow blots [it]_p20218 all out!"" [I]_p20220 took [it]_p20219 and looked. The two men might be Dr [Seward]_n2448 and Mr Morris. [I]_p20221 knew at all events that neither of [them]_p20222 was Jonathan. At the same time [I]_p20223 knew that Jonathan was not far off looking around [I]_p20224 saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at break-neck speed. One of [them]_p20225 [I]_p20226 knew was Jonathan, and the other [I]_p20227 took, of course, to be [Lord Godalming]_n2449. They, too, were pursuing the party with the cart. When [I]_p20228 told the [Professor]_n2450 [he]_p20229 shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, [he]_p20230 laid [his]_p20231 Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of [our]_p20232 shelter. ""They are all converging,"" [he]_p20233 said.",5,,17,
stoker_dracula," ""When the time comes [we]_p20234 shall have gypsies on all sides. "" [I]_p20235 got out [my]_p20236 revolver ready to hand, for whilst [we]_p20237 were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment [we]_p20238 looked again. [It]_p20239 was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as [it]_p20240 sank down towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around [us]_p20241 [I]_p20242 could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers, the wolves were gathering for [their]_p20243 prey. Every instant seemed an age whilst [we]_p20244 waited. The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as [it]_p20245 swept upon [us]_p20246 in circling eddies. At times [we]_p20247 could not see an arm's length before [us]_p20249  but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, [it]_p20252 seemed to clear the air-space around [us]_p20250 so that [we]_p20248 could see afar off. [We]_p20253 had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that [we]_p20254 knew with fair accuracy when [it]_p20256 would be and [we]_p20255 knew that before long the sun would set. [It]_p20257 was hard to believe that by [our]_p20258 watches [it]_p20259 was less than an hour that [we]_p20260 waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us.",0,,26,
stoker_dracula," The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. [It]_p20261 seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell. [We]_p20262 could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that [they]_p20263 were pursued [they]_p20264 seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops. Closer and closer [they]_p20265 drew. The [Professor]_n2451 and [I]_p20266 crouched down behind [our]_p20268 rock, and held [our]_p20269 weapons ready [I]_p20267 could see that [he]_p20270 was determined that [they]_p20271 should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of [our]_p20272 presence. All at once two voices shouted out to: ""Halt!"" One was [my]_p20273 [Jonathan]_n's,2452 raised in a high key of passion the other [Mr Morris]_n'2453 strong resolute tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken. Instinctively [they]_p20274 reined in, and at the instant [Lord Godalming]_n2454 and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr [Seward]_n2455 and [Mr Morris]_n2456 on the other.",6,,14,
stoker_dracula," The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat [his]_p20275 horse like a centaur, waved [them]_p20277 back, and in a fierce voice gave to [his]_p20276 companions some word to proceed. [They]_p20278 lashed the horses which sprang forward but the four men raised [their]_p20279 Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded [them]_p20280 to stop. At the same moment Dr [Van Helsing]_n2457 and [I]_p20281 rose behind the rock and pointed [our]_p20282 weapons at them. Seeing that [they]_p20283 were surrounded the men tightened [their]_p20284 reins and drew up. The leader turned to [them]_p20285 and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon [he]_p20286 carried, knife or pistol, and held [himself]_p20287 in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant. The leader, with a quick movement of [his]_p20288 rein, threw [his]_p20289 horse out in front, and pointing first to the sun, now close down on the hill tops, and then to the castle, said something which [I]_p20290 did not understand. For answer, all four men of [our]_p20291 party threw [themselves]_p20292 from [their]_p20293 horses and dashed towards the cart. [I]_p20294 should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been upon [me]_p20296 as well as the rest of [them]_p20297 [I]_p20295 felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of [our]_p20298 parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command [his]_p20299 men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in [his]_p20300 eagerness to carry out the order.",1,,26,
stoker_dracula," In the midst of this [I]_p20301 could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and [Quincey]_n2458 on the other, were forcing a way to the cart [it]_p20302 was evident that [they]_p20303 were bent on finishing [their]_p20304 task before the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract [their]_p20305 attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of [his]_p20306 purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of [him]_p20307 instinctively [they]_p20309 cowered, aside and let [him]_p20308 pass. In an instant [he]_p20310 had jumped upon the cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung [it]_p20311 over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, [Mr Morris]_n2459 had had to use force to pass through [his]_p20312 side of the ring of Szgany. All the time [I]_p20313 had been breathlessly watching Jonathan [I]_p20314 had, with the tail of [my]_p20315 eye, seen [him]_p20316 pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as [he]_p20318 won a way through them, and [they]_p20319 cut at him. [He]_p20320 had parried with [his]_p20321 great bowie knife, and at first [I]_p20325 thought that [he]_p20327 too had come through in safety but as [he]_p20328 sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, [I]_p20326 could see that with [his]_p20322 left hand [he]_p20328 was clutching at [his]_p20322 side, and that the blood was spurting through [his]_p20323 fingers. [He]_p20330 did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with [his]_p20331 great Kukri knife, [he]_p20333 attacked the other frantically with [his]_p20332 bowie. Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.",2,,32,
stoker_dracula," By this time the gypsies, seeing [themselves]_p20334 covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of [Lord]_n2460 [Godalming]_n2461 and Dr [Seward]_n,2462 had given in and made no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. [I]_p20335 saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him. [He]_p20336 was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which [I]_p20337 knew too well. As [I]_p20338 looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in [them]_p20339 turned to triumph. But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of [Jonathan]_n's2463 great knife. [I]_p20340 shrieked as [I]_p20341 saw [it]_p20342 shear through the throat whilst at the same moment Mr Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart. [It]_p20343 was like a miracle but before [our]_p20344 very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed from [our]_p20345 sight. [I]_p20346 shall be glad as long as [I]_p20347 live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as [I]_p20347 never could have imagined might have rested there. The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone of [its]_p20349 broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun.",4,,16,
stoker_dracula," The gypsies, taking [us]_p20350 as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as if for [their]_p20351 lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in [their]_p20352 wake, leaving [us]_p20353 alone. [Mr Morris]_n,2464 who had sunk to the ground, leaned on [his]_p20354 elbow, holding [his]_p20355 hand pressed to [his]_p20355 side the blood still gushed through [his]_p20356 fingers. [I]_p20358 flew to him, for the [Holy]_n2465 circle did not now keep [me]_p20359 back so did the two doctors. [Jonathan knelt]_n2466 behind [him]_p20360 and the wounded man laid back [his]_p20361 head on [his]_p20362 shoulder. With a sigh [he]_p20363 took, with a feeble effort, [my]_p20364 hand in that of [his]_p20365 own which was unstained. [He]_p20366 must have seen the anguish of [my]_p20367 heart in [my]_p20368 face, for [he]_p20370 smiled at [me]_p20372 and said:,   ""I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!"" [he]_p20371 cried suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, ""It was worth for this to die! Look! look!""  The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon [my]_p20368 face, so that [it]_p20374 was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse the men sank on [their]_p20375 knees and a deep and earnest ""Amen"" broke from all as [their]_p20376 eyes followed the pointing of [his]_p20377 finger. The dying man spoke:,   ""Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not more stainless than [her]_p20378 forehead! The curse has passed away!""  And, to [our]_p20379 bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, [he]_p20380 died, a gallant gentleman.",3,,30,
stoker_dracula," NOTE   Seven years ago [we]_p20381 all went through the flames and the happiness of some of [us]_p20384 since then is, [we]_p20382 think, well worth the pain [we]_p20382 endured. [It]_p20385 is an added joy to Mina and to [me]_p20386 that [our]_p20387 boy's birthday is the same day as that on which [Quincey]_n2467 Morris died. [His]_p20388 mother holds, [I]_p20389 know, the secret belief that some of [our]_p20390 brave friend's spirit has passed into him. [His]_p20391 bundle of names links all [our]_p20392 little band of men together but [we]_p20393 call [him]_p20394 [Quincey]_n2468. In the summer of this year [we]_p20395 made a journey to [Transylvania]_n,2469 and went over the old ground which was, and is, to [us]_p20396 so full of vivid and terrible memories. [It]_p20397 was almost impossible to believe that the things which [we]_p20398 had seen with [our]_p20399 own eyes and heard with [our]_p20400 own ears were living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation. When [we]_p20401 got home [we]_p20402 were talking of the old time, which [we]_p20402 could all look back on without despair, for [Godalming]_n2470 and [Seward]_n2471 are both happily married. [I]_p20404 took the papers from the safe where [they]_p20405 had been ever since [our]_p20406 return so long ago.",5,,26,
stoker_dracula," [We]_p20407 were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one authentic document nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later note-books of Mina and [Seward]_n2472 and myself, and [Van Helsing]_n's2473 memorandum. [We]_p20408 could hardly ask any one, even did [we]_p20409 wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story. [Van Helsing]_n2474 summed [it]_p20410 all up as [he]_p20411 said, with [our]_p20412 boy on [his]_p20413 knee:, ""We want no proofs [we]_p20415 ask none to believe us! This boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman [his]_p20414 mother is. Already [he]_p20416 knows [her]_p20418 sweetness and loving care later on [he]_p20417 will understand how some men so loved her, that [they]_p20421 did dare much for [her]_p20419 sake.
