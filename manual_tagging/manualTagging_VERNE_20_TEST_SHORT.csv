verne_20_test_short,"[It]_p0 was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke. At these words, [Ned Land]_n0 rose suddenly. The steward, nearly strangled, tottered out on a sign from [his]_p1 master. But such was the power of the commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which this man must have felt towards the Canadian. [Conseil]_n1 interested in spite of himself, [I]_p2 stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this scene. The commander, leaning against the corner of a table with [his]_p3 arms folded, scanned [us]_p4 with profound attention. Did [he]_p5 hesitate to speak? Did [he]_p6 regret the words which [he]_p6 had just spoken in [French]_n2 ? [One]_p8 might almost think so. After some moments of silence, which not one of [us]_p9 dreamed of breaking, ""[Gentlemen]_n3 ,"" said he, in a calm and penetrating voice, ""I speak [French]_n4 , [English]_n5 , German, and [Latin]_n6 equally well. [I]_p10 could, therefore, have answered [you]_p12 at [our]_p14 first interview, but [I]_p11 wished to know [you]_p13 first, then to reflect. The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the main points, convinced [me]_p15 of [your]_p16 identity.",7,,17,
verne_20_test_short," [I]_p17 know now that chance has brought before [me]_p18 M. [Pierre Aronnax]_n7 , [Professor]_n8 of [Natural]_n9 History at the [Museum]_n10 of [Paris]_n11 , entrusted with a scientific mission abroad, [Conseil]_n12 , [his]_p19 servant, and [Ned Land]_n13 , of Canadian origin, harpooner on board the frigate [Abraham Lincoln]_n14 of the navy of the [United States]_n15 of [America]_n16. "" [I]_p20 bowed assent. [It]_p21 was not a question that the commander put to me. Therefore there was no answer to be made. This man expressed [himself]_p22 with perfect ease, without any accent. [His]_p23 sentences were well turned, [his]_p24 words clear, and [his]_p25 fluency of speech remarkable. Yet, [I]_p26 did not recognise in [him]_p27 a fellow-countryman. [He]_p28 continued the conversation in these terms: ""You have doubtless thought, sir, that [I]_p29 have delayed long in paying [you]_p30 this second visit. The reason is that, [your]_p31 identity recognised, [I]_p32 wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you.",10,,16,
verne_20_test_short," [I]_p33 have hesitated much. Most annoying circumstances have brought [you]_p34 into the presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity. [You]_p35 have come to trouble [my]_p36 existence. "" ""Unintentionally!"" said I. ""Unintentionally?"" replied the stranger, raising [his]_p37 voice a little. ""Was [it]_p38 unintentionally that the [Abraham Lincoln]_n17 pursued [me]_p42 all over the seas? Was [it]_p39 unintentionally that [you]_p44 took passage in this frigate? Was [it]_p39 unintentionally that [your]_p45 cannon-balls rebounded off the plating of [my]_p46 vessel? Was [it]_p40 unintentionally that [Mr Ned Land]_n18 struck [me]_p43 with [his]_p47 harpoon?"" [I]_p48 detected a restrained irritation in these words. But to these recriminations [I]_p49 had a very natural answer to make, and [I]_p50 made it. ""Sir,"" said I, ""no doubt [you]_p51 are ignorant of the discussions which have taken place concerning [you]_p52 in [America]_n19 and [Europe]_n20. [You]_p53 do not know that divers accidents, caused by collisions with [your]_p54 submarine machine, have excited public feeling in the two continents. [I]_p55 omit the theories without number by which [it]_p56 was sought to explain that of which [you]_p57 alone possess the secret.",4,,25,
verne_20_test_short," But [you]_p58 must understand that, in pursuing [you]_p59 over the high seas of the [Pacific]_n21 , the [Abraham Lincoln]_n22 believed [itself]_p60 to be chasing some powerful sea-monster, of which [it]_p61 was necessary to rid the ocean at any price. "" A half-smile curled the lips of the commander: then, in a calmer tone: ""M. [Aronnax]_n23 ,"" [he]_p62 replied, ""dare [you]_p63 affirm that [your]_p64 frigate would not as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?"" This question embarrassed me, for certainly [Captain Farragut]_n24 might not have hesitated. [He]_p65 might have thought [it]_p66 [his]_p67 duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind, as [he]_p68 would a gigantic narwhal. ""You understand then, sir,"" continued the stranger, ""that [I]_p69 have the right to treat [you]_p71 as enemies?"" [I]_p70 answered nothing, purposely. For what good would [it]_p72 be to discuss such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments? ""I have hesitated some time,"" continued the commander ""nothing obliged [me]_p73 to show [you]_p74 hospitality. If [I]_p75 chose to separate [myself]_p79 from you, [I]_p76 should have no interest in seeing [you]_p80 again [I]_p76 could place [you]_p81 upon the deck of this vessel which has served [you]_p81 as a refuge, [I]_p77 could sink beneath the waters, and forget that [you]_p82 had ever existed. Would not that be [my]_p85 right?"" ""It might be the right of a savage,"" [I]_p86 answered, ""but not that of a civilised man. "" ""[Professor]_n25 ,"" replied the commander, quickly, ""I am not what [you]_p90 call a civilised man! [I]_p87 have done with society entirely, for reasons which [I]_p88 alone have the right of appreciating. [I]_p91 do not, therefore, obey [its]_p93 laws, and [I]_p92 desire [you]_p94 never to allude to [them]_p95 before [me]_p96 again!"" This was said plainly.",5,,37,
verne_20_test_short," A flash of anger and disdain kindled in the eyes of the Unknown, and [I]_p97 had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life of this man. Not only had [he]_p98 put [himself]_p104 beyond the pale of human laws, but [he]_p99 had made [himself]_p105 independent of them, free in the strictest acceptation of the word, quite beyond [their]_p106 reach! Who then would dare to pursue [him]_p107 at the bottom of the sea, when, on [its]_p110 surface, [he]_p99 defied all attempts made against him? What vessel could resist the shock of [his]_p111 submarine monitor? What cuirass, however thick, could withstand the blows of [his]_p112 spur? No man could demand from [him]_p108 an account of [his]_p112 actions God, if [he]_p100 believed in one, [his]_p113 conscience, if [he]_p100 had one, were the sole judges to whom [he]_p100 was answerable. These reflections crossed [my]_p115 mind rapidly, whilst the stranger personage was silent, absorbed, and as if wrapped up in himself. [I]_p116 regarded [him]_p117 with fear mingled with interest, as, doubtless, [OEdiphus]_n26 regarded the [Sphinx]_n27. After rather a long silence, the commander resumed the conversation.",2,,20,
