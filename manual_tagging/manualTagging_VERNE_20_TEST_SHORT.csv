verne_20_test_short,"[It]_p0 was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke. At these words, [Ned Land]_n0 rose suddenly. The steward, nearly strangled, tottered out on a sign from [his]_p1 master. But such was the power of the commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which this man must have felt towards the Canadian. [Conseil]_n1 interested in spite of himself, [I]_p2 stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this scene. The commander, leaning against the corner of a table with [his]_p3 arms folded, scanned [us]_p4 with profound attention. Did [he]_p5 hesitate to speak? Did [he]_p6 regret the words which [he]_p6 had just spoken in [French]_n2 ? [One]_p8 might almost think so. After some moments of silence, which not one of [us]_p9 dreamed of breaking,""[Gentlemen]_n3 ,""said he, in a calm and penetrating voice,""[I]_p10 speak [French]_n4 , [English]_n5 , German, and [Latin]_n6 equally well. [I]_p11 could, therefore, have answered [you]_p13 at [our]_p15 first interview, but [I]_p12 wished to know [you]_p14 first, then to reflect. The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the main points, convinced [me]_p16 of [your]_p17 identity.",7,,18,
verne_20_test_short," [I]_p18 know now that chance has brought before [me]_p19 M. [Pierre Aronnax]_n7 , [Professor]_n8 of [Natural]_n9 History at the [Museum]_n10 of [Paris]_n11 , entrusted with a scientific mission abroad, [Conseil]_n12 , [his]_p20 servant, and [Ned Land]_n13 , of Canadian origin, harpooner on board the frigate [Abraham Lincoln]_n14 of the navy of the [United States]_n15 of [America]_n16. "" [I]_p21 bowed assent. [It]_p22 was not a question that the commander put to me. Therefore there was no answer to be made. This man expressed [himself]_p23 with perfect ease, without any accent. [His]_p24 sentences were well turned, [his]_p25 words clear, and [his]_p26 fluency of speech remarkable. Yet, [I]_p27 did not recognise in [him]_p28 a fellow-countryman. [He]_p29 continued the conversation in these terms: ""[You]_p30 have doubtless thought, sir, that [I]_p31 have delayed long in paying [you]_p32 this second visit. The reason is that, [your]_p33 identity recognised, [I]_p34 wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you.",10,,17,
verne_20_test_short," [I]_p35 have hesitated much. Most annoying circumstances have brought [you]_p36 into the presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity. [You]_p37 have come to trouble [my]_p38 existence. "" ""Unintentionally!"" said I. ""Unintentionally?"" replied the stranger, raising [his]_p39 voice a little. ""Was [it]_p40 unintentionally that the [Abraham Lincoln]_n17 pursued [me]_p44 all over the seas? Was [it]_p41 unintentionally that [you]_p46 took passage in this frigate? Was [it]_p41 unintentionally that [your]_p47 cannon-balls rebounded off the plating of [my]_p48 vessel? Was [it]_p42 unintentionally that [Mr Ned Land]_n18 struck [me]_p45 with [his]_p49 harpoon?""[I]_p50 detected a restrained irritation in these words. But to these recriminations [I]_p51 had a very natural answer to make, and [I]_p52 made it. ""Sir,""said I,""no doubt [you]_p53 are ignorant of the discussions which have taken place concerning [you]_p54 in [America]_n19 and [Europe]_n20. [You]_p55 do not know that divers accidents, caused by collisions with [your]_p56 submarine machine, have excited public feeling in the two continents. [I]_p57 omit the theories without number by which [it]_p58 was sought to explain that of which [you]_p59 alone possess the secret.",4,,25,
verne_20_test_short," But [you]_p60 must understand that, in pursuing [you]_p61 over the high seas of the [Pacific]_n21 , the [Abraham Lincoln]_n22 believed [itself]_p62 to be chasing some powerful sea-monster, of which [it]_p63 was necessary to rid the ocean at any price. "" A half-smile curled the lips of the commander: then, in a calmer tone: ""M. [Aronnax]_n23 ,""[he]_p64 replied,""dare [you]_p65 affirm that [your]_p66 frigate would not as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?""This question embarrassed me, for certainly [Captain Farragut]_n24 might not have hesitated. [He]_p67 might have thought [it]_p68 [his]_p69 duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind, as [he]_p70 would a gigantic narwhal. ""[You]_p71 understand then, sir,"" continued the stranger, ""that [I]_p72 have the right to treat [you]_p74 as enemies?"" [I]_p73 answered nothing, purposely. For what good would [it]_p75 be to discuss such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments? ""[I]_p76 have hesitated some time,"" continued the commander ""nothing obliged [me]_p77 to show [you]_p78 hospitality. If [I]_p79 chose to separate [myself]_p83 from you, [I]_p80 should have no interest in seeing [you]_p84 again [I]_p80 could place [you]_p85 upon the deck of this vessel which has served [you]_p85 as a refuge, [I]_p81 could sink beneath the waters, and forget that [you]_p86 had ever existed. Would not that be [my]_p89 right?"" ""[It]_p90 might be the right of a savage,"" [I]_p91 answered, ""but not that of a civilised man. """"[Professor]_n25 ,""replied the commander, quickly,""[I]_p92 am not what [you]_p95 call a civilised man! [I]_p93 have done with society entirely, for reasons which [I]_p93 alone have the right of appreciating. [I]_p96 do not, therefore, obey [its]_p98 laws, and [I]_p97 desire [you]_p99 never to allude to [them]_p100 before [me]_p101 again!"" This was said plainly.",5,,41,
verne_20_test_short," A flash of anger and disdain kindled in the eyes of the Unknown, and [I]_p102 had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life of this man. Not only had [he]_p103 put [himself]_p109 beyond the pale of human laws, but [he]_p104 had made [himself]_p110 independent of them, free in the strictest acceptation of the word, quite beyond [their]_p111 reach! Who then would dare to pursue [him]_p112 at the bottom of the sea, when, on [its]_p115 surface, [he]_p104 defied all attempts made against him? What vessel could resist the shock of [his]_p116 submarine monitor? What cuirass, however thick, could withstand the blows of [his]_p117 spur? No man could demand from [him]_p113 an account of [his]_p117 actions God, if [he]_p105 believed in one, [his]_p118 conscience, if [he]_p105 had one, were the sole judges to whom [he]_p105 was answerable. These reflections crossed [my]_p120 mind rapidly, whilst the stranger personage was silent, absorbed, and as if wrapped up in himself. [I]_p121 regarded [him]_p122 with fear mingled with interest, as, doubtless, [OEdiphus]_n26 regarded the [Sphinx]_n27. After rather a long silence, the commander resumed the conversation.",2,,20,
