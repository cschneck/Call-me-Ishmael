This is a the first sentence. This is second sentence. John, and ,Smith went to the market. John beat Mary there, since she was late. Mary was having a sordid affair with Robert Cooper, her secret lover. Robert was found dead, but Mary won't rat out John. John was heir to the President of the Board of Directors, and he would inherit a large fortune and he would do anything to protect it. As the heir-apparent he had a reputation that he had earned. "She should keep her mouth shut" he said. "Robert was the first, then Mary." "What should we do about her?" he asked. "Kill her!". William Smith wasn't so sure. Mr. Smith had a record in the Great State of Virginia and was sure they would be caught. The Right Honourable Judge Finch is a fair judge, or so he believed.
